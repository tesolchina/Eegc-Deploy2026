            ## Contribution Analysis

            It looks like you have identified your thesis and received helpful feedback from the AI assistant on how to improve it, but you haven’t yet submitted a revised thesis statement or started revising topic sentences or body paragraphs. To move forward:

- Try rewriting your thesis to clearly state both main ideas—individuals influencing government actions and the role of personal lifestyle choices—in a concise sentence without phrases like “I think” or “I believe.”
- After updating your thesis, proceed to revise at least one topic sentence that supports your thesis, aiming for clear connection and focus.
- Then, work on revising a related body paragraph to improve clarity, coherence, and support for your ideas.

If you want, I can help you draft a revised thesis statement now, or guide you step-by-step through the revision of your essay parts. Just let me know!

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:43:35.243Z

**You:** Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individual do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I party agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

**Assistant:** Great! Thank you for sharing your current thesis statement:

> Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individual do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I party agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

Let’s look at it together.

**Strengths:**
- You identify the essay topic (climate change, individual vs. government/company action).
- You declare your point of view (partly agree).

**Areas to Revise:**
1. **Clarity and Focus:** The sentence is quite long and could be more direct. Let’s make your position stand out more clearly.
2. **Preview of Main Points:** To improve academic structure, try to briefly mention the two main ideas you will discuss (influence on government, role of personal choices).
3. **Confident Language:** Try not to use phrases like “I think” or “I believe.” State your ideas directly.
4. **Language Accuracy:** Watch for small errors—e.g., “actions of individual” should be “actions of individuals,” “party” should be “partly.”

**Guiding questions:**
- Can you clearly express that you believe individuals are important mainly because they can influence governments, but their personal choices still matter?
- Can you list your two points directly in your thesis?

**Here’s a simple model structure to follow (don’t use this exact version):**
While climate change requires action from governments and companies, individuals play a crucial role by influencing political decisions and adopting environmentally friendly habits.

**Would you like to try revising your thesis now, using these tips?** (Aim to clearly state your viewpoint and mention both points you plan to discuss.)
