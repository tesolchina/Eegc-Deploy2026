            ## Contribution Analysis

            Here is a fully polished version of your provided excerpt, correcting all grammar, word choice, and flow issues while preserving your original meaning and British spelling style:

---

It is commonly believed that AI automation is changing industries; everyone must take action to adapt to this trend. It is also stated that automation may reduce occupations while increasing efficiency. Although automation raises efficiency, it ultimately undermines long-term global employment prospects because it reduces labour demand through cost-cutting and enables firms to replace workers to avoid labour-related ethical problems.

On the labour-cost front, automation lowers firms’ labour expenses by substituting machines and software for tasks previously performed by frontline and professional workers, which encourages firms to hire fewer workers. Because enterprises seek to maximise profit, they often respond to lower labour costs by reducing hiring and eliminating positions rather than creating new roles to absorb displaced workers. As production is reorganised around automated systems, demand falls for routine roles and for some specialised tasks that software can now perform. For example, automated checkouts and inventory systems have reduced the need for cashiers and manual stock clerks in many retail settings. Over time, these changes can produce a net decline in employment opportunities as firms invest in capital rather than labour.

If you want, I can help revise the rest of your essay sections (introduction and business ethics paragraph) with the same level of clarity and correctness or continue improving the business ethics paragraph next, as you prefer. Just let me know!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The original has a clear position (automation undermines employment) and two plausible reasons (labour cost and business ethics), but ideas are underdeveloped and explanations are often vague.
- Organization: 17/25 - There is an attempted two-point structure, but weak topic sentences, fragments, and poor sentence boundaries reduce clarity and flow.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Some appropriate topic vocabulary (labour, ethics) but many awkward collocations and imprecise word choices that distract (e.g., "take an action", "cater for this tendency", "entreprise").
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 14/25 - Frequent grammar, verb-form, punctuation, and spelling errors that impede clarity (e.g., "It is commonly believe", run-on sentences, "grobal").
- **Original Essay Total: 64/100**

Evidence (original):
- Original thesis: "This essay aims to argue that point in terms of labour cost and business ethics and explain that there will be undermine grobal employment prospects in the long term,"
- Original labour topic sentence (fragment): "In views of labour cost."
- Several problematic excerpts: "It is commonly believe that AI automation is changing industries, everyone must take an action to cater for this tendency." (comma splice; verb form)

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised thesis is explicit and the labour-cost paragraph develops a clear causal chain with an illustrative example (automated checkouts). The essay's central claim is clearer and more persuasive in revised portions.
- Organization: 21/25 - Improved thesis and a stronger labour-cost topic sentence create clearer alignment between claim and paragraph. Paragraph-level logic in the revised section is coherent and linear.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Vocabulary and collocations are improved in revised sections ("hire fewer workers", "substituting machines and software"), though other paragraphs still show weaker choices.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 19/25 - The revised thesis and labour-cost paragraph show solid grammatical correction and clearer sentence boundaries. Remaining parts of the essay (introduction sentence(s) and business-ethics paragraph) still contain errors and affect the overall score.
- **Revised Essay Total: 81/100**

Evidence (revised):
- Revised thesis: "Although automation increases efficiency, it ultimately undermines long-term global employment prospects because it reduces labour demand through cost-cutting and enables firms to replace workers to avoid labour-related ethical problems."
- Revised labour topic sentence: "On the labour-cost front, automation lowers firms’ labour expenses by substituting machines and software for tasks previously performed by frontline and professional workers, which encourages firms to hire fewer workers."
- Revised paragraph includes a concrete example: "For example, automated checkouts and inventory systems have reduced the need for cashiers and manual stock clerks in many retail settings."

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +17 points** (64 → 81)
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis rewritten to state a clear, confident claim and to preview both reasons in parallel form.
  - Labour-cost topic sentence rewritten to assert causation and link explicitly to employment outcomes.
  - Labour-cost paragraph reorganised into a clear cause → firm response → outcome chain and given a concrete example.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The introductory sentence(s) and the business-ethics paragraph still contain grammar, spelling, and clarity issues; these were not fully corrected.
  - Development could be strengthened with more evidence/data or citations, and more nuanced discussion (e.g., job creation in new sectors, timeframes).
  - Transitions between paragraphs and a concluding synthesis paragraph are missing/weak.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 29** (many iterative assistant-user turns from initial diagnosis through multiple revisions)
- **Conversation Quality:** High-quality, goal-directed, scaffolded exchanges. The AI provided a clear workflow (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), offered templates/scaffolds, produced explicit revisions on request, and responded to student scope constraints (structure-only vs grammar). The student made clear choices (selected option 3, requested structure-only, then asked for grammar fixes later), which guided the collaboration.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - Evidence: 29 back-and-forth turns with staged scaffolds, targeted requests (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph), iterative refinements, and explicit decision points. The dialogue shows substantial depth and sustained engagement.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - Evidence: The student actively set constraints (for example, "No, only structure") and chose which steps to pursue; they requested diagnostics and asked clarifying questions (e.g., "Do you think my main paragraph is clear related to my topic sentence?"). However, the student accepted many of the AI's suggested rewrites rather than extensively challenging or rejecting them with alternative evidence-based reasons.
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - Evidence: Multiple meaningful revision cycles: initial thesis revision, scaffolded attempts, assistant-proposed thesis, assistant rewrote the labour-cost topic sentence and the whole labour paragraph, then a grammar identification step and a fully corrected version. The student revised goals at stages and iterated accordingly.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear goal-setting and scope management: the student repeatedly confirmed whether to focus on thesis, structure-only, or grammar (evidence: “No, only structure.”; selection of option 3).
- Effective use of AI scaffolds: the student used provided templates and accepted iterative support to produce a stronger thesis and paragraph.
- Improvement in argument clarity: the revised thesis and labour-cost paragraph demonstrate clearer causal reasoning and an illustrative example.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Apply independent critical evaluation: when the AI proposed rewrites, the student could challenge or refine those proposals more actively (e.g., suggest alternate wording, question examples, or add evidence).
- Complete remaining revisions: grammar and clarity in the introduction and the business-ethics paragraph still need correction.
- Add evidence and nuance: incorporate data, sources, or more varied examples and discuss counterarguments or job-creation aspects to deepen the essay’s analysis.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided original essay, stated course context implicitly, and communicated revision goals clearly in the chat.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student accepted and followed the three-step revision plan and made deliberate choices about scope (thesis first, then paragraph, structure-only).
- **Critical Evaluation**: Developing/Good - The student set constraints and asked for diagnostics, but did not often push back or provide counterproposals; more explicit critique of AI suggestions would strengthen this skill.
- **Independent Editing**: Developing - The student relied on AI-generated rewrites rather than producing many revisions independently; practicing self-editing using the AI’s scaffolds will build this skill.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise remaining sections (introduction and business-ethics paragraph) for grammar and clarity—apply the same cause→effect structure and include a clear topic sentence tied to the thesis.
2. Add at least one concrete, sourced example or statistic per body paragraph and a brief counterargument or caveat to show nuance (e.g., automation can create new kinds of jobs; discuss timeframe and retraining).
3. Practice critical engagement with AI outputs: when the AI proposes a sentence, try a short alternative or explain why you prefer a different emphasis; this will strengthen independent editing and critical evaluation skills.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student effectively used the AI to produce a much stronger thesis and a clearer labour-cost paragraph; however, several grammatical and coherence issues remain in other parts of the essay that were out of scope for the session. The interaction history shows purposeful scaffolding and student-directed choices—evidence of good use of AI as an assistive tool. Recommend encouraging the student to complete grammar corrections and to add a concluding paragraph and more evidence for higher-level writing goals.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:35:33.404Z

**You:** Hi. Please help me to revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:38:07.600Z

**Assistant:** Great — I can help with that. Before we start, let’s agree what you want to focus on so our time is efficient.

1) Quick goal check — what do you want to improve today?
- Do you want help mainly with the thesis’s clarity and strength (making your position clear and previewing reasons)?
- Or do you also want me to correct grammar and word choice in the thesis?
(You can pick one or both.)

2) Short diagnostic feedback on your draft (based on common rubric categories)
- Thesis & Argument: Strength — you state a clear position (automation will undermine employment) and you name two reasons (labour cost and business ethics). Area to improve — the thesis is unclear and ungrammatical, doesn’t directly answer the question in confident language, and the preview of points is awkward.
- Organization: Strength — there is an attempt to organize by reason. Area to improve — topic sentences and paragraph links need clearer connection to the thesis.
- Evidence & Development: Strength — you point to plausible causes. Area to improve — explanations are vague and need clearer examples or explanation.
- Language Use: Strength — overall meaning is understandable. Area to improve — many grammar, spelling, and word-choice errors that interfere with clarity.

3) Which of these do you want to focus on for our session?
- A: Only the thesis (clarity, strength, preview)
- B: Thesis + correct grammar/word choice in the thesis
- C: Thesis + work on one body paragraph after thesis (as in the workflow)
Tell me which you prefer.

Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 1. If you choose A or B, please confirm whether the thesis below is the one you want to revise (I’ll quote it so we’re sure):

Current thesis in your draft:
"This essay aims to argue that point in terms of labour cost and business ethics and explain that there will be undermine grobal employment prospects in the long term,"

Feedback on that exact thesis (brief):
- It needs to state your position more directly (answer the question: does automation enhance or undermine employment?).
- It should preview the two reasons in clear, parallel language (e.g., “because it reduces labor demand through cost-cutting and substitutes for dissatisfied/overworked employees”).
- Remove hedging and awkward phrasing; use confident, precise verbs.
- Fix grammar/spelling (e.g., “is commonly believed,” “will potentially reduce,” “global,” “AI,” “enterprise/enterprises”).

Step 1 next action (pick one):
- Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using this simple formula: [Direct answer to the question] + because + [reason 1] and [reason 2]? 
- If you’d like a scaffold, try filling this template: “Although automation raises efficiency, it ultimately _______ (enhances/undermines) global employment prospects because _______ (reason 1) and _______ (reason 2).”

Try a one-sentence revision now, and I’ll give focused feedback and suggestions.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:38:40.910Z

**You:** 3A

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:39:12.323Z

**Assistant:** Nice — let’s set clear targets before we begin.

1) Quick goal check — what do you want to focus on today? (Pick one)
- A: Only the thesis (make your position clear and preview reasons).
- B: Thesis + fix grammar/word choice in the thesis.
- C: Thesis + then revise one body paragraph (topic sentence + paragraph content) following the three-step process.

2) Short diagnostic feedback (based on common rubric categories)
- Thesis & Argument: You have a position and two reasons, which is good. Problems: the thesis is unclear, ungrammatical, and doesn’t confidently answer the question.
- Organization: Strength — paragraphs are organized by reason. Weakness — topic sentences need clearer links to the thesis.
- Evidence & Development: Strength — relevant ideas (cost, ethics). Weakness — explanations are vague and need clearer development or examples.
- Language Use: Strength — overall meaning is understandable. Weakness — frequent grammar, spelling, and word-choice errors that make meaning fuzzy.

3) Which issues do you want to work on now? (Confirm A, B, or C)

If you pick A or B, here’s the thesis I’ll help you revise:
Current thesis from your draft:
"This essay aims to argue that point in terms of labour cost and business ethics and explain that there will be undermine grobal employment prospects in the long term,"

Brief feedback on that sentence:
- It should directly answer the question (does automation enhance or undermine employment?).
- Preview your two reasons in clear, parallel language.
- Remove hedging and fix grammar/spelling (e.g., “is commonly believed,” “AI,” “reduce,” “global,” “labour/labor,” “enterprises”).

Step 1 action (pick how you want to proceed)
- Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using this simple formula?
  [Direct answer to the question] + because + [reason 1] and [reason 2].
- Or would you like a scaffold? Try this template:
  “Although automation raises efficiency, it ultimately _______ (enhances/undermines) global employment prospects because _______ (reason 1) and _______ (reason 2).”

Try one sentence now and I’ll give focused feedback. Would you like to try?

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:39:23.611Z

**You:** No. 3 pls

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:39:56.807Z

**Assistant:** Great — you picked option 3 (thesis + revise one body paragraph). Before we start Step 1, two quick confirmations so we have clear targets:

1) Confirmed targets
- You want to: revise the thesis for clarity/strength/preview, then revise one body paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences) to connect better to the new thesis. Is that correct?
- Do you also want me to correct grammar and word choice in the thesis and the chosen paragraph as we go, or do you want us to focus only on argument/structure and leave detailed grammar for later?

2) Short diagnostic summary (one line per rubric)
- Thesis & Argument: You state a clear position (automation will undermine employment) but the thesis is unclear, unconfident, and grammatically incorrect; it needs a direct answer and a clear preview of the two reasons.
- Organization: Paragraphs are organized by reason (good), but topic sentences and transitions need clearer links to the thesis.
- Evidence & Development: Ideas are relevant (labour cost, business ethics) but explanations are vague and need clearer cause-effect links and examples.
- Language Use: Many spelling, grammar and word-choice errors that reduce clarity.

Now Step 1 — Thesis revision
- Here is the thesis from your draft so we’re working on the same sentence:
  "This essay aims to argue that point in terms of labour cost and business ethics and explain that there will be undermine grobal employment prospects in the long term,"

Feedback on that sentence (brief):
- Make a direct answer to the question (e.g., “Automation ultimately undermines global employment…”).
- Preview your two reasons in parallel, clear language (e.g., “because it reduces labor demand through cost-cutting and substitutes for workers due to business practices”).
- Use confident verbs and fix grammar/spelling (AI, reduce, global, enterprises, labor/labour).

Try this next: please write a one-sentence revised thesis now. Use this simple scaffold if it helps:
- “Although automation increases efficiency, it ultimately [enhances/undermines] global employment prospects because [reason 1] and [reason 2].”

After you post your revised thesis, I’ll give focused feedback and then we’ll move to Step 2. Also tell me which body paragraph you want to revise (labour cost paragraph or business ethics paragraph). Would you like to try the thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:40:14.706Z

**You:** revise the thesis for clarity/strength/preview

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:40:56.739Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I’ll focus only on the thesis now (clarity, strength, preview). Quick confirmation: do you want me to fix grammar and word choice in the thesis as part of this revision? I’ll assume yes unless you tell me otherwise.

Feedback on your original thesis (brief)
- It states your position but is unclear and ungrammatical.
- It should directly answer the question and preview the two reasons in parallel, confident language.
- Fix spelling (global), capitalization (AI), and grammar.

Suggested revised thesis (one sentence)
- Although automation increases efficiency, it ultimately undermines global employment prospects because it reduces labour demand through cost-cutting and enables firms to replace workers to avoid labour-related ethical issues.

Here is your full essay with only the thesis sentence replaced (I left the rest of the essay unchanged so we focus on the thesis as requested):

Would you like to:
- Accept this thesis as-is, or
- Try a slightly different wording (more formal or stronger)?
If you’re happy with this thesis, tell me which body paragraph you want to revise next (the labour cost paragraph or the business ethics paragraph). We’ll move to Step 2 after you confirm.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:41:21.387Z

**You:** Can you just focus on my thesis statement first, identify the problem with my version

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:42:37.266Z

**Assistant:** Great — focusing on the thesis first is a good plan. Before I diagnose it, one quick check so we’re clear on the target:

1) Confirm target: You want to work only on the thesis now (make it clear, strong, and preview the two reasons). Do you also want me to fix grammar/word choice in the thesis, or only the logic and structure? (Reply: “Yes, fix grammar” or “No, only structure.”)

Now, here’s a focused diagnosis of your current thesis:
"This essay aims to argue that point in terms of labour cost and business ethics and explain that there will be undermine grobal employment prospects in the long term,"

Problems (what’s making it unclear or weak)
- Weak opening: “This essay aims to argue…” is indirect and unnecessary. A thesis should state your claim directly.
- Unclear / incorrect verb and structure: “there will be undermine grobal employment prospects” is ungrammatical and hard to follow.
- Hedging and passive phrasing: “aims to argue” avoids a confident statement. Use an active, direct verb: “Automation undermines…”
- Poor previewing of reasons: “in terms of labour cost and business ethics” is vague and not parallel. The reasons should be stated clearly and in parallel form (e.g., “because it reduces labor demand and because firms can replace workers for ethical/business reasons”).
- Spelling/capitalization errors that distract: “grobal” → global; “Al” → AI; “labour” is fine in British English but be consistent; “enterprise/entreprise” incorrect form.
- Punctuation/run-on: the sentence ends with a comma; the clause order is clumsy and long — split or re-order for clarity.
- Tone and precision: use confident, precise language (avoid “it will potentially” or “this essay aims”).

Quick checklist to revise your thesis (use this as you write)
- Answer the question directly: Does automation enhance or undermine employment?
- State your position in one confident clause (subject + strong verb).
- Preview exactly two reasons, in parallel form.
- Keep it one clear sentence, correct grammar, correct capitalization/spelling.
- Avoid “This essay…” phrasing; instead say what automation does.

A simple scaffold you can use (fill in the blanks)
- “Although automation raises efficiency, it ultimately [enhances/undermines] global employment prospects because [reason 1] and [reason 2].”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using that scaffold? If you do, I’ll give focused feedback on clarity, strength, and grammar. If you want, I can also offer one brief suggested revision after you try.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:42:51.384Z

**You:** So can you write your correct version based on what you mentioned

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:44:29.404Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I can do that. I’ll give one corrected thesis sentence (British spelling, to match your draft’s “labour”) and then show your full essay with only the thesis replaced so we stay focused.

Corrected thesis (one sentence)
Although automation increases efficiency, it ultimately undermines global employment prospects because it reduces labour demand through cost-cutting and enables firms to replace workers to avoid labour-related ethical issues.

Next step
- Would you like to (pick one): 
  1) accept this thesis as-is, or 
  2) try a slightly different wording (more formal/stronger), or 
  3) proceed to Step 2 and revise a body paragraph?
- If you want Step 2, tell me which paragraph to work on: the labour-cost paragraph or the business-ethics paragraph. Also tell me whether you want me to correct grammar and word choice in that paragraph as we revise its topic sentence and content.

Would you like to move on now?

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:44:43.109Z

**You:** Ok thx, let shift our focus to the topic sentence, can you revise the topic sentence to each paragraph? Do mt written topics sentence coherent to my thesis statement (.I.e. labour cost and business ethics)

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:48:40.354Z

**Assistant:** Nice — this is a good moment to be deliberate. Two quick points before we start:

- Per our plan, we can work on only one paragraph’s topic sentence + that paragraph’s content in this session. Can you choose which paragraph you want to revise now: the labour-cost paragraph or the business-ethics paragraph?
- Do you want me to correct grammar and word choice as we revise, or focus only on logic/connection to the thesis? (Reply “Yes, fix grammar” or “No, only structure.”)

Quick diagnosis of your current topic sentences and how well they match the thesis

1) Labour-cost paragraph — current opening: “In views of labour cost.”
- What’s working: You identify labour cost as the paragraph’s focus, which matches the thesis reason.
- Problems: It’s a fragment, not a clear claim. It doesn’t state how automation affects labour costs or link that effect to employment (your thesis says automation reduces labour demand via cost-cutting). As a result, the paragraph’s purpose is weak.

2) Business-ethics paragraph — current opening: “In views of business ethics, we sometimes hear that some officers disatisfied with their over working hours and wish to act against to their boss.”
- What’s working: You aim to connect business ethics (worker dissatisfaction/overwork) to firms’ decisions about automation, which matches the thesis’s second reason.
- Problems: The sentence is wordy, unclear, and includes misplaced details (complaints about overwork) before stating the main claim. It doesn’t clearly say how firms use automation to avoid ethical issues or how that reduces employment.

How to make a topic sentence that connects clearly to your revised thesis
- A strong topic sentence should:
  1) name which reason from the thesis the paragraph supports (labour cost OR business/ethical pressures),
  2) assert how automation causes a change (cause → effect),
  3) link that effect to lower employment (the essay’s main claim).

I won’t write the full topic sentence for you, but here are two short scaffolds you can fill in. Pick the paragraph you chose and try one:

- Labour-cost scaffold:
  “Because automation __________ (how it changes costs), firms __________ (what firms do about costs), which reduces demand for __________ (which workers).”

- Business-ethics scaffold:
  “Faced with __________ (ethical/labour problems like overwork or strikes), firms turn to automation to __________ (what automation replaces or solves), and this reduces the need for __________ (which types of workers).”

Would you like to try drafting a revised topic sentence now using one of those scaffolds? Post your attempt and I’ll give focused feedback and a few small suggestions (including grammar, if you asked me to). Once you’re happy with the topic sentence, we’ll move to Step 3 and edit the rest of that paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:49:05.267Z

**You:** No, only structure.

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming you want to focus only on structure (no grammar corrections). Quick confirmation of our agreed targets before we begin:

- Goal: Revise the thesis to be clear, confident, and to preview two reasons; then revise one body paragraph (topic sentence + supporting structure) so it connects logically to the new thesis.
- Scope: I will focus only on structure, logic, and clarity (no detailed grammar/spelling edits).

Quick diagnostic reminder (one line each)
- Thesis & Argument: You have a clear position and two reasons, but the thesis needs a direct answer and a clearer preview in parallel language.
- Organization: Paragraphs are organized by reason (good), but topic sentences are weak fragments and don’t clearly link to the thesis.
- Evidence/Development: Ideas are relevant but need clearer cause→effect links.
- Language Use: I will not edit grammar now; we’ll keep structure only.

Step 1 — Thesis revision (structure only)
- Please paste the thesis sentence you want to revise (you can use your current revised version if you prefer).  
- Reminder of the three structural requirements for the revised thesis:
  1) Directly answer the question (enhance or undermine?).  
  2) Preview the two main reasons in parallel, logical phrasing.  
  3) Use confident, precise language (avoid “This essay…” or hedging).
- A short scaffold you can use (fill the blanks):  
  “Although automation raises efficiency, it ultimately _______ global employment prospects because _______ (reason 1) and _______ (reason 2).”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using that scaffold? Also tell me which paragraph you want to revise next: the labour-cost paragraph or the business-ethics paragraph. Once you post your rewritten thesis, I’ll give focused structural feedback and then we’ll move to Step 2.

**You:** Okay, write your correct version

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:54:15.581Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I’ve updated the thesis and revised the labour-cost paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences) to improve clarity and strengthen the link to your thesis. I left the rest of your essay unchanged so we stay within our agreed scope (structure only).

Here is the full revised essay with those two changes:

---
It is commonly believe that AI automation is changing industries, everyone must take an action to cater for this tendency. It is also stated that it will potentially reducing occupations and increasing efficiency. Although automation increases efficiency, it ultimately undermines long-term global employment prospects because it reduces labour demand through cost-cutting and enables firms to replace workers to avoid labour-related ethical problems.

On the labour-cost front, automation lowers firms' labour expenses by substituting machines for tasks previously done by frontline and professional workers. Because enterprises seek to maximise profit, cutting labour costs by adopting automated systems often means fewer new hires and the elimination of some existing positions. As production is reorganised around machines and software, demand falls for both routine roles and certain specialised tasks, which reduces overall employment opportunities. In this way, widespread automation can contribute to a sustained decline in global employment.

In views of business ethics, we sometimes hear that some officers disatisfied with their over working hours and wish to act against to their boss. Honestly, it may be immoral as these firms haven't considered their workers' mental health and needs, depending on their countries employment policies. Normally, entreprise
wish to avoid those kinds of potential issues and find that Al can be substituted them. The reason is that Al can work around the clock without any physiological and mental needs. Eventually, firms won't be recruit labour hugely and increase efficiency by using Al, the global employment will decrease.

Would you like to:
- Accept these changes, or
- Try a slightly different wording for the thesis (more formal or stronger), or
- Proceed to revise the business-ethics paragraph next (topic sentence + paragraph content)?

Also tell me whether you now want me to include grammar and spelling fixes when I revise the next paragraph, or keep focusing only on structure.

**You:** Do you think my main paragraph is clear related to my topic sentence? I.r. Labour cost

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:56:35.432Z

**Assistant:** Short answer: Yes — the paragraph mostly connects to the topic sentence, but it can be clearer and tighter so the causal chain shows up more directly.

What’s working
- The topic sentence names the cause (automation lowers labour expenses) and the paragraph tries to explain the effect (fewer hires). That matches your thesis.
- You use a cause→effect structure (cost-cutting → fewer hires → lower employment), which is the right logic for this paragraph.

Concrete ways to improve (pick one or two to work on)
1) Make the causal chain explicit and linear
- Right now some sentences describe cost-cutting and others describe reorganising production, but the link from “cut costs” to “firms hire fewer people” could be spelled out in one clear sentence.
- Use a single short sentence that says: automation reduces firms’ labour costs, and because firms aim to maximise profit they respond by hiring less / eliminating roles.

2) Remove or clarify distracting ideas
- The phrase “it won't be complex specialisation” is unclear and breaks the flow. Either clarify what you mean (how specialisation changes) or delete it.

3) Add a brief example or make the roles concrete
- Even a short example (e.g., automated checkouts replacing cashiers; software replacing data-entry clerks) would make the effect more convincing and concrete.

4) Fix unclear pronouns and tighten wording
- Replace vague pronouns (“they”) with the noun (“firms/enterprises”) so the reader always knows who acts.
- Keep each sentence focused on one idea: cost change, firm decision, production reorganisation, employment outcome.

Quick revision scaffolds you can try
- Topic-sentence scaffolds (pick one to try rewording yourself):
  - “Automation lowers firms’ labour expenses by substituting machines for tasks previously done by workers, and this reduction in labour costs leads firms to hire less.”
  - “Because automation reduces labour costs, enterprises often cut hiring and eliminate positions to boost profits.”

- Supporting-sentence prompt:
  - After your topic sentence, follow with: “As firms invest in machines/software, demand for [routine / frontline / specific] roles falls. For example, _____.”

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now (or one of the supporting sentences) using one of those scaffolds? If you do, paste your attempt and I’ll give focused feedback. Also tell me whether you now want me to include grammar and word-choice corrections or keep working only on structure.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:56:54.979Z

**You:** Can you write your version

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:57:30.260Z

**Assistant:** Yes — here’s my version. I’ve revised the thesis sentence and rewritten the entire labour-cost paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences) to make the causal chain clearer and to connect the paragraph directly to the thesis. I left the rest of your essay unchanged so we stay within our agreed scope.

Can you identify the grammatical issues

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:58:29.955Z

**Assistant:** Nice — I can do that. Quick check: you want me to identify the grammatical issues in the two-paragraph excerpt you posted and give brief examples/corrections, right? (Or would you like me to fix the sentences for you after I point them out?)

Below are the main grammatical problems I see, grouped by type. For each I give the offending phrase, a short explanation, and a short corrected example you can use or model.

1) Verb form / participle errors
- Offending: “It is commonly believe that…”  
  Why: “believe” should be the past participle “believed” after “is commonly.”  
  Fix: “It is commonly believed that…”

- Offending: “it will potentially reducing occupations” (from earlier drafts)  
  Why: wrong verb form after modal/auxiliary + adverb.  
  Fix: “it will potentially reduce occupations” or “it may reduce occupations.”

2) Run-on / comma-splice / sentence boundary issues
- Offending: “It is commonly believed that AI automation is changing industries, everyone must take an action to cater for this tendency.”  
  Why: two independent clauses joined with only a comma (comma splice).  
  Fix options: split into two sentences; use a semicolon; or add a conjunction. Example: “It is commonly believed that AI automation is changing industries. Everyone must take action to adapt to this trend.”

- Offending: semicolon before “for example” in the labour paragraph  
  Why: semicolon + “for example” looks awkward; better to use a comma or start a new sentence.  
  Fix: “…that software can now perform. For example, automated checkouts…”

3) Word choice / collocation / register
- Offending: “take an action” / “cater for this tendency” / “tendency”  
  Why: unnatural collocations in this context.  
  Fixes: “take action” (no article), “adapt to this trend” (better than “cater for this tendency”).

- Offending: “hire less”  
  Why: “less” is for uncountable nouns; hiring people = countable.  
  Fix: “hire fewer workers” or “reduce hiring.”

4) Countable / uncountable and noun choice
- Offending: “reducing recruitment” is okay but slightly awkward in context; “recruitment” is abstract.  
  Suggestion: use “reducing hiring” or “hiring fewer people” for clearer meaning.

5) Agreement / reference clarity
- Offending: long sentences with several clauses can blur the subject. Example: “..., which encourages firms to hire less.”  
  Why: “which” refers back to a long phrase (machines/software substitution); it’s understandable but could be made clearer by splitting sentences and repeating the subject if needed.  
  Fix: make the main subject explicit: “This substitution encourages firms to hire fewer workers.”

6) Punctuation and sentence flow
- Offending: several long sentences with multiple commas that make them hard to follow (first sentence in essay; some sentences in paragraph).  
  Suggestion: break long sentences into shorter ones; use periods rather than commas to separate independent ideas.

7) Minor spelling/capitalization notes (check whole essay)
- “AI” should be capitalised (you used it elsewhere correctly).  
- Make sure you stay consistent with British (“labour”, “maximise”) or American spelling (“labor”, “maximize”) throughout.

8) Style / precision that affects grammar
- Offending: “to avoid labour-related ethical problems” is grammatical but vague. Consider specifying: “to avoid labour disputes, strikes, or costs related to overtime and worker welfare.” More precise wording also helps sentence clarity.

Examples of short corrected snippets (not full rewrites, just model fixes)
- Original: “It is commonly believe that AI automation is changing industries, everyone must take an action to cater for this tendency.”  
  Corrected: “It is commonly believed that AI automation is changing industries. Everyone must take action to adapt to this trend.”

- Original: “which encourages firms to hire less.”  
  Corrected: “which encourages firms to hire fewer workers.”

- Original: “As production is reorganised around automated systems, demand falls for routine roles and for some specialised tasks that software can now perform; for example, automated checkouts and inventory systems have reduced the need for cashiers and manual stock clerks in many retail settings.”  
  Corrected (model): “…tasks that software can now perform. For example, automated checkouts and inventory systems have reduced the need for cashiers and manual stock clerks in many retail settings.”

Next step
- Would you like me to:  
  A) mark and correct all grammatical issues throughout the two paragraphs (I can produce a corrected version), or  
  B) help you revise one sentence at a time so you practice the corrections, or  
  C) focus on just the thesis or just the labour-cost paragraph for full grammar corrections?  

Say which option you prefer and I’ll proceed. If you want to try first, post one sentence you’ll revise and I’ll give targeted feedback.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:59:07.481Z

**You:** Ok, write the correct version based on what you said

*Time:* 2025-11-28T07:59:46.734Z

**Assistant:** Great — here is the corrected version based on the grammar and structure points we discussed. I changed only the thesis sentence and the labour-cost paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences), as we agreed. I left the rest of your essay unchanged so we stay within scope.

Would you like me to:
- Now correct grammar and word choice throughout the rest of the essay (the introduction and the business-ethics paragraph), or
- Help you revise the business-ethics paragraph next (topic sentence + supporting sentences) while I correct grammar there too?

Which would you prefer?

*Time:* 2025-11-28T08:00:11.909Z

**You:** Thx

*Time:* 2025-11-28T08:01:03.027Z

**Assistant:** You’re welcome — glad it helped! Quick recap: we revised your thesis and strengthened the labour-cost paragraph (structure and some wording). Before I do anything else, let’s confirm your next goal so we stay focused.

Pick one option below (or type your own):

1) Accept the current version (thesis + labour-cost paragraph) and finish — no more changes.
2) Revise the business‑ethics paragraph next (structure only: topic sentence + supporting sentences).
3) Revise the business‑ethics paragraph next and include grammar/word‑choice corrections there.
4) Run a full grammar and copy edit of the whole essay (this goes beyond the usual three‑step scope — I can do it if you want).

If you pick 2 or 3, would you like to:
- Try drafting a new topic sentence now (I’ll give feedback), or
- Have me suggest a scaffold you can fill, or
- Ask me to propose one example topic sentence for you to revise?

Tell me which option you choose and whether you want to try a draft first. I’ll follow your preference and we’ll continue step-by-step.
