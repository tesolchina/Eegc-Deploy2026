### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- **Content and Ideas:** 18/25  
  *Justification:* The essay attempts to discuss both the negative short-term and positive long-term impacts of automation and AI on global employment, and considers developed vs. developing countries. However, explanations are often vague, and examples are limited or unclear. The argument is present but needs greater specificity and development.
- **Organization:** 17/25  
  *Justification:* There is an evident introduction, several body paragraphs considering different perspectives, and a conclusion. Paragraph structure is uneven, sentence flow often unclear, and ideas sometimes repeat without clear progression.
- **Vocabulary:** 15/25  
  *Justification:* Vocabulary is basic and generally understandable, but word choice errors are frequent (“labors an time”, “no deniable”, “there labors”), limiting the clarity and precision. Little academic variety.
- **Grammar:** 14/25  
  *Justification:* Errors in subject-verb agreement, run-on sentences, punctuation, and unclear phrasing make ideas difficult to follow and weaken academic tone (“needs lots of labors an time”, “promote the efficiency”, “no deniable”).
- **Original Essay Total:** 64/100

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- **Content and Ideas:** 22/25  
  *Justification:* The revised essay presents a clear thesis, balanced short-term and long-term perspective, and addresses impacts on different global regions. Specific examples of types of jobs created and challenges for low-skilled workers add depth. Still, some development and supporting evidence could be expanded.
- **Organization:** 22/25  
  *Justification:* Structure is much improved. Ideas flow logically from introduction to developed country effects, then developing country situations, and a succinct conclusion. Paragraphs are more distinct and transitions clearer.
- **Vocabulary:** 20/25  
  *Justification:* Significant improvement. Vocabulary is more academic and topic-specific (“automation and AI”, “data analysts”, “robots engineers”). Some simplification was achieved as requested. Minor errors persist, but overall much clearer.
- **Grammar:** 19/25  
  *Justification:* Grammar and sentence structure are notably improved. Some sentences are still basic, but run-ons and major errors are reduced. Language is concise, more formal, and easier to follow.
- **Revised Essay Total:** 83/100

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +19 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis statement revised to be much more specific, balanced, and previewed main arguments.
  - Topic sentence and supporting body paragraph are more focused on the economic transition and job market shifts, with clearer reasoning.
  - Vocabulary and grammar accuracy increased. Sentences are clearer, more academic, and varied.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Further evidence (such as statistics, case studies, or more concrete examples) could strengthen the argument.
  - Conclusion can be expanded for deeper critical evaluation, not just summary.
  - More sentence variety and linking devices would further elevate academic style.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges:** 28 (assistant and user turns)
- **Conversation Quality:**  
  The conversation followed a structured, scaffolded revision process. The student responded to diagnostic feedback, set priorities, and asked for models at each revision step. The AI provided guidance, explicit rubrics, model sentences, and paragraph versions. The student often preferred to receive models or simplified examples rather than producing own revision drafts, indicating a more passive collaboration.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation:** 3/5  
  *Justification:* The student participated in a moderately-length exchange covering all revision steps. The depth was sometimes limited because the student frequently requested models rather than asking probing or developmental questions. There was little multi-layered analysis or exploration beyond asking for sample sentences.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions:** 2/5  
  *Justification:* The student largely accepted AI suggestions and models without explicit evaluation or discussion. There was minimal evidence of independent critique, adaptation, or justification for choices. Occasional requests for simplicity indicated some personal direction.
- **Refining Process:** 2/5  
  *Justification:* The process followed the three-step structure (thesis, topic sentence, body paragraph), but the student did not engage iteratively: instead, most revision requests were simply prompts for the AI to produce a model. There was little evidence of student-led drafting or editorial decision-making, nor genuine multiple revision cycles.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total:** 7/15

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
As the development of A1 is popular and stronger nowadays the automation is replacing some traditional industries which needs lots of labors an time. In that way, many firms choose to reduce jobs to lower their cost for the automation machine. It seems that this technology shift undermines global employment. However ,from my perspective, in the long term, it can enhance global employment prospect.
Instead of employing more labors to pay for their salaries and enhancing the working efficiency, more and more firms choose to fire their employees and purchase automation AI machines to make more profits. It’s no deniable that it causes severe global unemployment problems as the people who rely on physical working like the farmers can't find jobs .However, in the long term, the demand of high-technology people will increase. The social objectives will change from simple and repeatable jobs to AI- applied and high-technology jobs. It decreases the employment of the simplest workers but will increase the employment of people who is able to control and develop AI in the long term.
However, it is worth noting that people in poor countries who are not able to have much educational resources can only do the simple jobs like picking, planting and transporting some original materials. The automation may not have much effects in these countries because the costs of machines exceeds the cost of employing there labors. Totally, considering the different situations that the developing and developed countries are facing, this technology shift really promote the efficiency of social development and will enhance global employment prospects in the long term, especially the demand for jobs that AI can’t replace human at all, forcing people to find balance between technology development and human beings.



Revised:
As the development of AI is popular and stronger nowadays the automation is replacing some traditional industries which needs lots of labors an time. In that way, many firms choose to reduce jobs to lower their cost for the automation machine. Although automation and AI may reduce traditional jobs in the short term, in the long run, these technologies can improve global employment prospects by creating new opportunities in high-tech industries, increasing overall economic efficiency, and encouraging a shift toward more skilled positions—especially in developed countries.
In the short term, automation and artificial intelligence have led many companies to decrease their workforce, resulting in higher unemployment rates in traditional sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture. In the long term, automation and artificial intelligence will increase the demand for workers with advanced technical skills. As more industries adopt these technologies, the job market is shifting away from simple, repetitive tasks toward positions that require expertise in programming, maintenance, and the development of automated systems. For example, companies now require more AI specialists, data analysts, and robotics engineers to manage and improve their operations. Although employment opportunities for low-skilled workers may decrease, the growth of high-tech industries creates new jobs that offer greater stability and higher wages. This change demonstrates that automation can enhance global employment prospects by encouraging workers to develop new skills and adapt to evolving workplace needs.
In many developing countries, most people work in jobs that do not need special skills, such as farming or simple factory work. Because workers in these countries often earn low wages, it is usually cheaper for companies to hire people than to buy expensive machines. For this reason, automation does not have a big effect on employment in these places yet. However, as technology becomes cheaper in the future, these countries may also start to use more automation. Therefore, it is important to help people in developing countries learn new skills so they can find new jobs if technology changes the types of work that are needed.
 Overall, while automation affects developed and developing countries differently, it can support economic growth and improve global employment prospects in the long run. However, society must ensure that technological progress is balanced with opportunities for human work, especially in jobs that AI cannot replace.

*Time:* 2025-11-16T15:18:42.681Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s begin with our **preliminary stage**: negotiating targets and diagnosing the essay.

---

## 1. Negotiate Targets

First, could you tell me what your personal goals are for this essay revision session?  
Here are some common areas students often want to improve—do any of these sound important for you today?

- Clarity (expressing ideas clearly)
- Argument strength (making your position convincing)
- Structure (organization of ideas)
- Grammar and vocabulary
- Academic style (sounds formal and objective)
- Critical analysis (going deeper into the topic)

**Which two or three do you most want to focus on?** Or do you have another specific goal in mind? Let’s agree together before we move on!

---

## 2. Diagnostic Feedback

While you think about your goals, here’s quick feedback using four academic writing rubrics:

**Thesis & Argument:**  
- The essay does express your position ("in the long term, it can enhance global employment prospect"), which is positive.
- The thesis could be clearer and more specific about *how* and *why* automation/AI helps global employment long-term.

**Organization:**  
- The paragraph order makes sense: presenting the problem, considering different countries, concluding.
- Some sentences are a bit long or unclear; some ideas repeat or could be grouped together for better flow.

**Evidence & Development:**  
- Good job mentioning both immediate and long-term effects, and considering developed vs developing countries.
- However, some points need more explanation or evidence (“demand of high-technology people will increase”—why?).

**Language Use:**  
- Vocabulary: generally understandable, but sometimes confused words or grammar (“labors an time,” “no deniable,” “there labors”).
- Sentence structure: some run-ons; punctuation and clarity can improve.
- Academic tone: mostly objective, but some phrases could sound more formal.

## Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision

Here is your current thesis statement:

> It seems that this technology shift undermines global employment. However, from my perspective, in the long term, it can enhance global employment prospect.

### Feedback

- **Clarity:** The meaning is clear, but could be more direct and specific.
- **Argument Strength:** Good to mention both sides, but your position ("in the long term, it can enhance...") should stand out, with a hint of *how* or *why*.
- **Structure:** Preview your main reasons or points.
- **Grammar/Vocabulary:** The phrase "global employment prospect" should be plural: "global employment prospects". Also, "it seems that..." is a bit hesitant/weak.

### Tips for your revision:
- State your position confidently.
- Clearly refer to both short-term and long-term effects.
- Briefly mention the main reasons or areas you will discuss (e.g., shift in job types, impact on different countries).
- Use formal, precise academic language.

#### Example Structure (not a full rewrite, for reference):
"In the short term, automation appears to reduce employment opportunities, but in the long run, it can actually improve global employment prospects by creating new technology-focused jobs and increasing efficiency, especially in developed countries."

---

**Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now?**

*Time:* 2025-11-16T15:39:39.966Z

**Assistant:** Excellent—thank you for sharing the paragraph you want to focus on!

Let’s move into **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**.

---

## Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision

First, let’s identify the current topic sentence in your chosen paragraph:

> Instead of employing more labors to pay for their salaries and enhancing the working efficiency, more and more firms choose to fire their employees and purchase automation AI machines to make more profits.

**Feedback:**

- **Clarity:** The sentence is quite long and a bit difficult to follow. The main point is about why firms switch to automation.
- **Connection to Thesis:** You want to focus on the *effects* of automation on employment, especially in the short term, as previewed in your (model) thesis.
- **Academic Language:** Try “workers” instead of “labors”. “Firms” and “employees” are good academic words.

### Questions to consider:
- What is the main idea this paragraph is communicating?
  - Is it about the immediate effect of automation on traditional jobs?
  - Is it about companies’ motivations?
- How does this topic sentence relate to your revised thesis (“automation reduces jobs in the short term, but will improve prospects long-term by creating new skilled opportunities”)?

---

### Guiding prompt:

**Would you like to try revising this topic sentence for clarity and a stronger connection to your thesis?**
- Try to state clearly: “In the short term, automation causes job losses in certain industries because...”
- Keep it focused on the *effect* of automation, not just company decisions.

---

#### Here’s a model structure (please write your own version!):

“In the short term, automation and AI are causing many companies to reduce their workforce, leading to increased unemployment in traditional industries.”

**You:** can you give me a model?

*Time:* 2025-11-16T15:40:24.806Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Here’s a **model topic sentence** that matches your revised thesis and addresses your priorities—**clarity, argument strength, structure, and grammar/vocabulary**:

> In the short term, automation and artificial intelligence have led many companies to decrease their workforce, resulting in higher unemployment rates in traditional sectors such as manufacturing and agriculture.

**Key features:**
- **Clear subject** (automation and AI are causing job reduction)
- **Strong, direct statement** (no hedging language)
- **Logical connection** to your thesis (focus on immediate effects before discussing long-term benefits)
- **Correct grammar and vocabulary** (“decrease their workforce,” “traditional sectors”)

**You:** However, in the long term, the demand of high-technology people will increase. The social objectives will change from simple and repeatable jobs to AI- applied and high-technology jobs. It decreases the employment of the simplest workers but will increase the employment of people who is able to control and develop AI in the long term.

*Time:* 2025-11-16T15:41:38.748Z

**Assistant:** Great! You’ve chosen this paragraph for revision:

> However, in the long term, the demand of high-technology people will increase. The social objectives will change from simple and repeatable jobs to AI- applied and high-technology jobs. It decreases the employment of the simplest workers but will increase the employment of people who is able to control and develop AI in the long term.

Let's move on to **Step 3: Revising the Rest of the Chosen Paragraph**.

---

## Step 3: Revising Supporting Sentences

Let’s work together to make this paragraph clearer, better organized, and more convincing, while focusing on your goals: **Clarity, Argument Strength, Structure, and Grammar/Vocabulary**.

### 1. **Clarity & Unity**

- Each sentence should be directly related to the topic sentence (the long-term positive effects on employment).
- Try to use precise language — for example, “the demand for highly skilled workers” instead of “demand of high-technology people.”
- Use transitions to connect your ideas smoothly.

### 2. **Guiding Questions**

- Do you clearly explain *why* the demand for skilled workers will grow with automation?
- Can you give a brief example (such as IT, AI development, or maintenance)?
- Do you show the contrast between jobs that will decrease and those that will increase?

---

Let’s look at each sentence with some feedback.

**Original:**  
> However, in the long term, the demand of high-technology people will increase.

- **Feedback**: “The demand of high-technology people” can be clearer. Try “the demand for highly skilled workers” or “professionals with advanced technology skills.”
- Two ideas: long-term effect + who benefits. Try to state in one sentence.

**Next sentence:**  
> The social objectives will change from simple and repeatable jobs to AI-applied and high-technology jobs.

- **Feedback**: "Social objectives" is unclear. You probably mean "types of available jobs" or "job market focus."
- Try: “The job market will shift from simple, repetitive tasks to roles that require technological expertise or working alongside AI systems.”

**Next sentence:**  
> It decreases the employment of the simplest workers but will increase the employment of people who is able to control and develop AI in the long term.

- **Feedback**: “It” is a little vague. “Simplest workers” can be more academic—try “workers performing routine tasks.”
- Explain *how or why* employment for skilled workers increases.

---

### **Let’s revise, step by step.**

#### 1. Start by combining ideas:
- Long-term, automation increases the demand for skilled workers, while reducing low-skill jobs.

#### 2. Explain *how* or *why* this happens:
- As technology becomes more widespread, the economy needs people who can design, program, maintain, or work with AI and automated systems.

#### 3. Give a quick example (optional for strength):
- For example, demand for AI programmers or automation technicians rises.

#### 4. Link back to your argument: 
- Although some jobs are lost, new higher-skill positions are created.

---

### **Would you like to try rewriting this paragraph in your own words, using the hints above?**

You might start with something like:
> In the long term, automation and AI will increase the demand for workers with advanced technical skills...

— and continue to explain what kinds of jobs grow, how the job market changes, and why this supports your thesis.

**Try writing your revised version now!**
- Keep sentences clear and connected.
- I’ll give you feedback and help polish it further!

Would you like to give it a try? If you’d like, just start with the first sentence, and we’ll build the rest together!

*Time:* 2025-11-16T15:44:00.234Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely—I’m happy to offer a **model paragraph** you can use for inspiration. Please remember to read it carefully, then try to write your own version based on your understanding and ideas before submitting it for feedback. You'll learn much more by expressing the ideas yourself!

---

**Model Paragraph (Long-Term Positive Impact of Automation on Employment):**

In the long term, automation and artificial intelligence will increase the demand for workers with advanced technical skills. As more industries adopt these technologies, the job market is shifting away from simple, repetitive tasks toward positions that require expertise in programming, maintenance, and the development of automated systems. For example, companies now require more AI specialists, data analysts, and robotics engineers to manage and improve their operations. Although employment opportunities for low-skilled workers may decrease, the growth of high-tech industries creates new jobs that offer greater stability and higher wages. This change demonstrates that automation can enhance global employment prospects by encouraging workers to develop new skills and adapt to evolving workplace needs.

---

**Notice:**
- Each sentence is clear and directly related to the topic sentence.
- The paragraph explains *why* skilled jobs are increasing and what this means for employment.
- There is an example (AI specialists, data analysts, etc.) for stronger argument.
- Academic language and variety of vocabulary are used.

---

**Your turn:**  
Use this model as a guide, but please try to write your own paragraph in your words! Even if you keep some similar sentence structures, changing vocabulary or adding your own example is a useful practice.

**Would you like to start by rewriting the first sentence? If you’d like, I can help you expand from there—just share what you write!**

*Time:* 2025-11-16T15:44:05.482Z

**You:** However, it is worth noting that people in poor countries who are not able to have much educational resources can only do the simple jobs like picking, planting and transporting some original materials. The automation may not have much effects in these countries because the costs of machines exceeds the cost of employing there labors. Totally, considering the different situations that the developing and developed countries are facing, this technology shift really promote the efficiency of social development and will enhance global employment prospects in the long term, especially the demand for jobs that AI can’t replace human at all, forcing people to find balance between technology development and human beings.

*Time:* 2025-11-16T15:45:02.901Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s work through **Step 3: Revising the Rest of the Chosen Paragraph**, using your selected paragraph:

> However, it is worth noting that people in poor countries who are not able to have much educational resources can only do the simple jobs like picking, planting and transporting some original materials. The automation may not have much effects in these countries because the costs of machines exceeds the cost of employing there labors. Totally, considering the different situations that the developing and developed countries are facing, this technology shift really promote the efficiency of social development and will enhance global employment prospects in the long term, especially the demand for jobs that AI can’t replace human at all, forcing people to find balance between technology development and human beings.

Let’s revise **sentence by sentence** for:  
**Clarity, Argument Strength, Structure, and Grammar/Vocabulary**—your priority areas.

---

### 1. First sentence:

> However, it is worth noting that people in poor countries who are not able to have much educational resources can only do the simple jobs like picking, planting and transporting some original materials.

**Feedback:**
- “Poor countries” → “developing countries” (more academic/formal)
- “who are not able to have much educational resources” → “with limited access to education” (clearer)
- “can only do the simple jobs” → “often work in low-skilled positions, such as picking, planting, and transporting raw materials”

**Questions:**
- Do you want to emphasize lack of educational access, or the types of jobs available?
- You can connect it to automation’s limited reach in these areas.

#### Here’s an example structure (NOT a full rewrite!):

“In many developing countries, limited education means most people work in low-skilled jobs, such as...”

---

### 2. Second sentence:

> The automation may not have much effects in these countries because the costs of machines exceeds the cost of employing there labors.

**Feedback:**
- “Automation may not have much effects” → “Automation may have less impact”
- “the costs of machines exceeds the cost of employing there labors” → “because the cost of machines is higher than the cost of local labor” (grammar and clarity!)

---

### 3. Third and fourth sentences (conclusion):

> Totally, considering the different situations that the developing and developed countries are facing, this technology shift really promote the efficiency of social development and will enhance global employment prospects in the long term, especially the demand for jobs that AI can’t replace human at all, forcing people to find balance between technology development and human beings.

**Feedback:**
- “Totally, considering...” → Instead: “Overall” or “Taking these differences into account”
- “promote the efficiency of social development and will enhance global employment prospects in the long term” (good academic conclusion, but needs clearer structure)
- The phrase about “jobs that AI can’t replace human at all” is a little unclear. Try: “especially for positions that require human skills which AI cannot replicate.”
- “forcing people to find a balance...” Try expressing this as a recommendation: “Therefore, it is important to balance technological progress with the need for human employment.”

**You:** another model?

*Time:* 2025-11-16T15:45:28.345Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Here is **another model paragraph** for the effects of automation and AI on employment in developing countries, using formal, clear, and academic language. This model is slightly different in both structure and vocabulary from my previous examples. Please use it for inspiration, but remember to try writing your own version after reading, so you can practice and develop your skills.

---

**Model Paragraph:**

In many developing countries, most people are employed in low-skilled jobs such as agriculture, basic manufacturing, or manual transportation, largely due to limited access to higher education and training opportunities. In these contexts, automation and advanced technologies often have a smaller impact on employment because investing in expensive machines is not cost-effective compared to hiring local workers. As a result, traditional forms of employment are likely to remain important in these regions for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, as technology becomes more affordable, even developing economies may experience gradual changes in their job markets. Therefore, it is crucial for both governments and businesses to invest in education and skill development, so that workers are better prepared to adapt to future technological shifts while maintaining a balance between innovation and social stability.

---

**Key Features in This Model:**
- **Academic vocabulary** ("contexts," "investing," "cost-effective," "foreseeable future," "adapt to future technological shifts")
- **Clear structure** (opening with the current situation, explaining the reason for limited automation impact, concluding with a suggestion)
- **Balanced argument** (acknowledges both limited short-term impact and potential for change in the future)
- **Formal, objective tone**

**You:** make it simpliest

*Time:* 2025-11-16T15:46:13.780Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Here is a **simplified version** of your paragraph, keeping the ideas clear and using academic, but more basic, language:

---

**Simplified Paragraph:**

In many developing countries, most people work in jobs that do not need special skills, such as farming or simple factory work. Because workers in these countries often earn low wages, it is usually cheaper for companies to hire people than to buy expensive machines. For this reason, automation does not have a big effect on employment in these places yet. However, as technology becomes cheaper in the future, these countries may also start to use more automation. Therefore, it is important to help people in developing countries learn new skills so they can find new jobs if technology changes the types of work that are needed.

---

**Key features:**

- Short and direct sentences.
- Academic but clear vocabulary.
- Explains reasons and gives a simple recommendation.

**You:** Totally, considering the different situations that the developing and developed countries are facing, this technology shift really promote the efficiency of social development and will enhance global employment prospects in the long term, especially the demand for jobs that AI can’t replace human at all, forcing people to find balance between technology development and human beings.

*Time:* 2025-11-16T15:47:23.025Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let's focus on revising your concluding sentence and tying together your paragraph about differences between developing and developed countries, with strong attention to clarity, academic style, and grammar.

Here is your original sentence to revise:

> *"Totally, considering the different situations that the developing and developed countries are facing, this technology shift really promote the efficiency of social development and will enhance global employment prospects in the long term, especially the demand for jobs that AI can’t replace human at all, forcing people to find balance between technology development and human beings."*

---

### Feedback and Guidance

- **“Totally”** is informal—try “Overall” or “In conclusion.”
- **“Considering the different situations that the developing and developed countries are facing”** is good, but can be expressed more concisely, e.g., “Given the differences between developing and developed countries...”
- **“This technology shift really promote”** should be “This technology shift promotes...” (subject-verb agreement).
- **“the efficiency of social development”** is a bit unclear. You might want “the efficiency of economic and social development.”
- **“will enhance global employment prospects in the long term, especially the demand for jobs that AI can’t replace human at all”** → clarify: “...will enhance global employment prospects in the long term, particularly in roles that require uniquely human skills, which AI cannot replace.”
- The last part (“forcing people to find balance between technology development and human beings”) should be more of a recommendation: “Therefore, it is important to balance technological advancement with opportunities for human employment.”

### Guided Revision

Try putting your new conclusion together like this:

>
Overall, given the differences between developing and developed countries, this technological shift can promote economic and social development, and is likely to improve global employment prospects in the long term. However, it is important to recognize that some jobs require uniquely human skills which AI cannot replace. Therefore, societies should aim to balance technological progress with the need to provide employment opportunities for people.

**You:** can you give me a model?

*Time:* 2025-11-16T15:47:53.212Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Here is a **model concluding paragraph** for your essay, focusing on clarity, academic tone, and your main argument about automation, AI, and employment in both developing and developed countries:

---

**Model Concluding Paragraph:**

Overall, considering the distinct situations faced by developing and developed countries, the transition toward automation and artificial intelligence can stimulate both economic and social progress. While it is true that automation may have a smaller impact in regions where manual labor remains cost-effective, the long-term outlook suggests that technological advancements will create more opportunities for skilled employment on a global scale. Nevertheless, certain roles that require uniquely human abilities—such as creativity, emotional intelligence, or complex decision-making—are unlikely to be replaced by AI. Therefore, it is essential for societies to balance technological progress with policies that support education and workforce development, ensuring that the benefits of innovation lead to broader employment opportunities for everyone.

---

**Key Features:**
- Academic and precise vocabulary
- Summarizes differences between countries
- Recognizes both benefits and limitations of automation
- Ends with a recommendation about education and workforce development
