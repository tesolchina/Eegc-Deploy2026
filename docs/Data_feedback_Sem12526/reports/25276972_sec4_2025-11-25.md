            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for your responses during our session! I see that you preferred to “pretend” the thesis and topic sentences were revised, and then moved forward. While that approach allowed us to cover the revision steps broadly, to get the most out of your writing development, I recommend that next time you do the actual revisions within the chat. That way, I can provide targeted feedback on your precise wording and suggest fine improvements, helping you refine your writing more deeply.

Here are some tailored next steps and tips based on our work and your revised essay:

---

### Suggestions for Strengthening Your Essay Further

1. **Correct Key Collocations and Word Choices**  
   - Replace **“impart”** with **“impact”** or **“effect.”**  
   - Change phrases like **“take a good use of AI”** to **“make good use of AI.”**  
   - Use idiomatic expressions: **“in the long term”** (with article) rather than **“in long term.”**

2. **Add Specific, Concrete Examples**  
   Strengthen your arguments with precise examples or data. For instance:  
   - Cite how robotic automation in manufacturing freed workers to do quality control and system design.  
   - Mention new job roles emerging from AI, such as data annotators or AI ethicists.

3. **Develop Clear Cause-Effect Chains in Paragraphs**  
   For example, rather than saying “automation replaces people to carry boxes,” expand to:  
   - “Automation can replace routine manual tasks such as carrying boxes, allowing workers to focus on strategic planning and creative problem-solving. This shift not only increases productivity but also fosters innovation and new employment opportunities.”  

4. **Work on Sentence Variety and Concision**  
   Avoid repetition of phrases like “in the long term” by using synonyms like “over time” or “eventually.” Combine short related sentences where possible to enhance flow.

5. **Improve Grammar and Mechanics**  
   - Be consistent with spacing after punctuation.  
   - Watch article use before “long term.”  
   - Review capitalization rules (e.g., “AI automation,” not “Al automation”).

---

### Recommendations for Future AI-Assisted Revision Sessions

- **Paste your actual rewritten sentences or paragraphs for review** rather than summarizing revisions abstractly. This helps me give precise grammar, vocabulary, and clarity feedback.

- **Engage critically with AI suggestions:** Share which suggestions you accept, modify, or reject, and explain your reasoning. This deepens your understanding and control over your writing.

- **Work incrementally:** Revise sentence by sentence or paragraph by paragraph, and ask for targeted help at each stage. This iterative process yields stronger results.

### Example of a Revised Thesis (for reference)

> Although automation may eliminate some routine jobs, it will ultimately have a positive impact on global employment in the long term because it increases productivity and enables people to develop higher-level skills.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The original states a clear position (“the technological shift can bring good impart on global employment ultimately in long term”) but development is superficial and repetitive; claims are asserted with little explanation of mechanisms (e.g., “the automation replaces people to carry boxes,while people can spend more time designing strategies and researching.”).
- Organization: 18/25 - Basic essay structure is present (introduction, two body paragraphs, conclusion), but topic sentences repeat the thesis and paragraph-level logical links are weak (“First of all, I think ...” then examples that are not fully connected).
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Limited and error-prone word choice (e.g., “good impart,” “less meanings work,” “do some thing more meaningful”), which reduces clarity.
- Grammar: 15/25 - Frequent grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures (articles, prepositions, punctuation, word forms) that sometimes impede meaning.
- **Original Essay Total: 65/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised thesis is clearer and attempts to preview reasons: “Although automation may eliminate some routine jobs, it will ultimately bring positive impart on global employment in the long term because AI automation can improve work efficiency and help people improve their personal skills.” The essay adds clearer explanation of how work shifts to higher-value tasks. However, the argument remains somewhat generalized and would benefit from stronger, specific evidence and nuance (e.g., how new job categories form, empirical examples or data).
- Organization: 21/25 - Paragraphing and progression improved: the first body paragraph begins with a clearer claim (“First of all, the technological shift can improve productivity and enhance people's interest and attitude about work.”) and supporting sentences link more directly to the claim. Transitions and paragraph linkage are better but some repetition remains (the conclusion largely restates prior sentences).
- Vocabulary: 19/25 - Vocabulary shows improvement (e.g., “improve productivity,” “better morale and a greater sense of purpose”), but persistent awkward collocations and word choices remain (“positive impart,” “take a good use of AI,” “at some extent”).
- Grammar: 18/25 - Many sentences are clearer after revision, yet notable grammatical and mechanical errors remain (missing spaces after periods in places, capitalization errors like “Al automation,” and awkward phrasing such as “bring positive impart” and “make people to feel”). These issues reduce readability.
- **Revised Essay Total: 79/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +14 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis clarity and preview: the revised thesis explicitly frames a qualified position and gives reasons to be developed.
  - Stronger topic sentence and paragraph focus: paragraph 1 topic sentence and supporting sentences are clearer and more closely linked to the thesis.
  - Improved vocabulary in places and better phrasing for morale/productivity (e.g., “better morale and a greater sense of purpose”).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Grammar and collocations: persistent errors such as “positive impart” (should be “positive impact”), “take a good use of AI” (should be “make good use of AI”), and punctuation/capitalization mistakes should be fixed.
  - Evidence and nuance: the essay would be stronger with concrete examples, statistics, or references showing how automation creates specific new jobs or industries; address counterarguments more precisely.
  - Sentence variety and concision: some sentences are still wordy or repetitive; tightening phrasing would improve readability.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9** (messages in the chat: assistant-user-assistant-user-assistant-user-assistant-user-assistant)
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided structured, detailed guidance (diagnosis, stepwise revision plan for thesis → topic sentence → paragraph). The student provided the original/revised essay texts but did not paste stepwise revisions into the chat; instead the student repeatedly said “let’s pretend we have revised…” and did not perform the interactive revision steps. Evidence: user messages “let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on” and “let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on,” indicating acceptance but no iterative drafting in-chat.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Developing. There are a moderate number of exchanges (9), and the assistant's guidance is detailed and multi-step. However, the student did not engage in deep iterative drafting in-chat (no counter-questions, no pasted rewrites), so depth is limited. Evidence: the assistant’s stepwise prompts (e.g., “Step 1: Revise your thesis statement. Step 2: Choose one body paragraph...”) contrasted with the user replies that avoid producing revised drafts.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 - Limited. The student accepted the AI’s suggestions without critique or reasoned evaluation and did not journal evidence-based acceptances/rejections. Evidence: user responses that simply say to “pretend” revisions were done and no instances of the student challenging or justifying choices.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 - Limited. There is little to no evidence of iterative revision cycles in the chat; the assistant provided a revision plan but the student did not perform or post the stepwise edits for feedback. Evidence: absence of revised sentences exchanged in the chat despite the assistant asking the student to paste rewrites.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 5/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear stance and essay structure: the student consistently presents a pro-automation position and organizes the essay into introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion (evidence: both Original and Revised Essay structures).
- Use of illustrative examples: the essay uses tangible examples (e.g., “automation replaces people to carry boxes,” “AI automation does not have the ability to teach students in classrooms”) to support claims.
- Responsiveness to feedback offline: the Revised Essay shows concrete improvements (thesis rephrasing, clearer topic sentence, some improved phrasing), suggesting the student incorporated feedback even if not shown step-by-step in chat.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Active engagement in AI-assisted revision: the student should paste draft revisions into chat and respond to the assistant’s prompts to enable iterative feedback and deeper learning.
- Grammar and collocation accuracy: correct recurring errors (e.g., “impart” → “impact”; “take a good use of” → “make good use of”; “in long term” → “in the long term”).
- Development of evidence and nuance: add more specific examples, data, or more precise mechanisms explaining how automation creates new roles and where displacements may occur; address contrasting evidence.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student provided the essay but did not specify revision priorities when prompted nor paste revisions for guidance. Evidence: assistant asked for targets; the student did not indicate chosen targets but instead said to “pretend” revisions were done.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The assistant offered a clear 3-step plan; the student did not follow the interactive steps in-chat to demonstrate the plan’s application.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student did not critically assess AI suggestions in chat (no acceptance/rejection rationale).
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The revised essay shows offline editing, but the student did not demonstrate independent, iterative editing in the chat interaction as requested.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. In-chat iterative revision: When working with an AI coach, paste each revised sentence/paragraph into the chat and request targeted feedback; this enables meaningful iterative improvement and shows evidence of the refining process.
2. Grammar and collocations practice: Focus study on frequent error patterns observed (article use, prepositions, common collocations like “impact,” “make good use of,” “in the long term”) and use short targeted exercises or grammar-check tools to correct recurring mistakes.
3. Strengthen evidence and counterargument: Add one concrete example (e.g., a specific industry where automation created new jobs) and a brief, stronger counterargument paragraph acknowledging short-term job loss and explaining mitigation via retraining or policy.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student submitted a revised essay that shows measurable improvements, but the chat history indicates limited active engagement in the prescribed AI-assisted revision process. It appears the student may have revised offline rather than following the stepwise interactive method requested by the assistant. For grading or formative evaluation, consider asking the student to (a) show the actual intermediate revisions they made in response to the assistant’s prompts, and (b) explain which AI suggestions they accepted, modified, or rejected and why.
- Specific recurring language errors (e.g., “impart” vs. “impact,” “take a good use of AI”) should be highlighted for remediation in subsequent lessons or targeted exercises.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
With technology progressing rapidly, automation is changing industries, potentially reducing jobs while improving work efficiency. So it is argued that does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in long term. From my perspective,I think that the technological shift can bring good impart on global employment ultimately in long term.

First of all, I think the technological shift can make more efficient and enhance people's interest and attitude about work. The automation can take over some fixed, boring and time-consuming but less meanings work so that employees can save their time to do some thing more meaningful. In the long term,people work with good mood sand meaningful mind and the productive efficiency can be enhanced as well,so the automation is definitely good for global employment. For example, the automation replaces people to carry boxes,while people can spend more time designing strategies and researching.

Secondly, people can not be replaced by AI automation as long as people cooperate with AI well and take good use of them. And Al automation can even bring more job opportunities to people. For example, AI automation does not have the ability to teach students in classrooms in the current situation. But teachers can take a good use of AI to improve teaching efficiency and save time. And someone may be not suitable for teaching at first. After they cooperate with automation, they can become more confident and experienced so that they can try being a teacher.All in all, technological shift can enhance global employment in long term at some extent.

For me, although automation is changing industries, I think the technological shift is good for global employment in long term. According to above explanation, the automation can make people to feel that their jobs are more meaningful and can enhance productive efficiency. Besides, automation can even bring other opportunities and improving one's ability at some extent. So I hold the view that we should embrace the shift in technology and cooperate well with automation to improve global industries.

Revised:
With technology progressing rapidly, automation is changing industries, potentially reducing jobs while improving work efficiency. So it is argued that does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in long term. Although automation may eliminate some routine jobs, it will ultimately bring positive impart on global employment  in the long term because AI automation can improve work efficiency and help people improve their personal skills.

First of all, the technological shift can improve productivity and enhance people's interest and attitude about work. The automation can take over some fixed, boring and time-consuming but less meanings work so that employees can save their time to do some thing more meaningful. In the long term, people work with better morale and a greater sense of purpose and the productive efficiency can be enhanced as well, so the automation is definitely good for global employment. For example, the automation replaces people to carry boxes, while people can spend more time designing strategies and researching. These creative works are more critical to the development of society and countries.

Secondly, people can not be replaced by AI automation as long as people cooperate with AI well and take good use of them. And Al automation can even bring more job opportunities to people. For example, AI automation does not have the ability to teach students in classrooms in the current situation. But teachers can take a good use of AI to improve teaching efficiency and save time. And someone may be not suitable for teaching at first. After they cooperate with automation, they can become more confident and experienced so that they can try being a teacher.All in all, technological shift can enhance global employment in the long term at some extent.

Generally speaking, although automation is changing industries, the technological shift is good for global employment in the long term. According to above explanation, the automation can make people to feel that their jobs are more meaningful and can enhance productive efficiency. Besides, automation can even bring other opportunities and improving one's ability at some extent. So I hold the view that we should embrace the shift in technology and cooperate well with automation to improve global industries.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-25T02:52:51.411Z

**You:** From my perspective,I think that the technological shift can bring good impart on global employment ultimately in long term.

*Time:* 2025-11-25T03:43:50.247Z

**Assistant:** Hi — I’m glad you shared your draft. Before we begin revising, let’s agree what you want to work on today.

1) Quick goal check
Which of these do you most want to improve in this session? (Pick up to 2–3.)
- Clarity and strength of the thesis (makes your position clear and previews main points)
- Paragraph/topic-sentence focus and logical organization
- Evidence and development (stronger examples and explanation)
- Vocabulary and word choice (accuracy and variety)
- Grammar and sentence structure (articles, prepositions, punctuation, sentence variety)

Tell me which targets you want to focus on.

2) Short diagnostic (based on the rubric)
- Content & Ideas: You have a clear overall position (automation is positive long‑term), and relevant ideas. But your argument is surface-level and needs more development and nuance (for example, how exactly does automation create jobs? Where might it harm employment?).
- Organisation & Logical Progression: You have an intro, two body paragraphs, and a conclusion, which is good. Topic sentences are vague and repeat the thesis rather than previewing distinct points. Transitions and logical links between claim → example → explanation need strengthening.
- Vocabulary: Some useful words appear, but there are repeated words and awkward collocations (e.g., “good impart,” “less meanings work”). Choose tighter, topic‑specific verbs and nouns.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Frequent errors with articles, prepositions, punctuation, word order, and some awkward sentences that make your meaning unclear. Sentence variety is limited.

Strengths to keep: clear stance; use of examples (box carrying, teachers); overall structure is present.

3) Which weakness should we tackle now?
Please pick the one (or two) issues from the list below that you want us to focus on in the three-step process:
- Thesis clarity & previewing main points
- Topic-sentence connection to thesis (choose one body paragraph to revise)
- Improving the rest of that paragraph (evidence, explanation, coherence)
- Grammar and word-choice corrections in the revised parts

Once you confirm your priorities, we’ll move to Step 1. If you want to focus on the thesis, you already gave your current thesis:
"From my perspective,I think that the technological shift can bring good impart on global employment ultimately in long term."

If the thesis is one of your targets, tell me that now and then try revising it based on the guidance I’ll give. Would you like to focus on the thesis first, or pick a different priority?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T03:44:08.604Z

**You:** So it is argued that does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in long term. From my perspective,I think that the technological shift can bring good impart on global employment ultimately in long term.

*Time:* 2025-11-25T03:47:43.607Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for sharing your draft. Let’s agree the goals and priorities before we start revising.

1) Quick goal check
Which 1–3 of these do you want to work on today? (Pick up to three.)
- Clarity and strength of the thesis (makes your position clear and previews main points)
- Paragraph/topic-sentence focus and logical organization
- Evidence and development (stronger examples and explanation)
- Vocabulary and word choice (accuracy and variety)
- Grammar and sentence structure (articles, prepositions, punctuation, sentence variety)

Tell me which ones you choose.

2) Short diagnostic (based on the rubric)
- Content & Ideas: You have a clear overall position: you believe technological change is positive for long‑term employment. Good. But ideas are basic and need clearer reasoning and more precise development (how automation creates jobs, and when it might harm them).
- Organisation & Logical Progression: You have intro, two body paragraphs, and conclusion — good structure. Topic sentences are vague and mostly repeat the thesis instead of previewing distinct points. The logical links from claim → example → explanation need strengthening.
- Vocabulary: Some useful words but many awkward collocations and repetitions (e.g., “good impart,” “less meanings work,” “take a good use of AI”).
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Frequent errors with articles, punctuation, word order and word forms that sometimes make meaning unclear. Sentence variety is limited.

Strengths to keep: clear stance, attempt to use examples, basic essay structure.

3) Which weakness should we tackle now?
Pick one (or two) of the diagnosed weaknesses for our three-step process:
- Thesis clarity & previewing main points
- Topic-sentence connection to thesis (choose one body paragraph to revise)
- Improving the rest of that paragraph (evidence, explanation, coherence)
- Grammar and word-choice corrections in the revised parts

Tell me which you want to focus on. (If you pick two, I suggest: thesis + one paragraph.)

If you choose the thesis now
You already shared your current thesis:
"From my perspective,I think that the technological shift can bring good impart on global employment ultimately in long term."

Quick feedback on that thesis:
- Tone: It hedges with “From my perspective, I think.” For academic essays use confident language (no “I think”).
- Word choice: “good impart” is incorrect. Use “benefit,” “positive impact,” or “net benefit.”
- Clarity & preview: It doesn’t preview the main reasons. A strong thesis answers the question clearly and briefly previews the main points you will develop.
- Grammar: “in long term” should be “in the long term” (or “over the long term”).

Hints for rewriting (please try one yourself first)
- Use a clear, confident structure: State your position, then give 2–3 brief reasons that you will develop.
- Useful template (fill the brackets): Although automation may eliminate some routine jobs, it will ultimately [clear position verb, e.g., “increase” or “benefit”] global employment because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].
- Example words for reasons: raises productivity, creates new job categories, improves worker skills, enables higher-value work, or supports new industries.

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Type your revised thesis and I’ll give focused feedback. If you prefer, say which body paragraph you want to revise next (paragraph 1 about meaningful work/productivity, or paragraph 2 about jobs created through cooperation with AI).

*Time:* 2025-11-25T03:48:03.478Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on

*Time:* 2025-11-25T03:58:09.364Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. I’ll assume the thesis is already revised as you said. Now let’s move into Step 2 (topic sentence).

1) Which body paragraph do you want to work on: paragraph 1 (about meaningful work and productivity) or paragraph 2 (about people cooperating with AI and new job opportunities)?

2) Here are the current topic sentences for quick reference:
- Paragraph 1: “First of all, I think the technological shift can make more efficient and enhance people's interest and attitude about work.”
- Paragraph 2: “Secondly, people can not be replaced by AI automation as long as people cooperate with AI well and take good use of them.”

3) Quick guidance on a strong topic sentence (use this checklist when you rewrite):
- Make a clear, specific claim that links directly to the thesis (don’t repeat the thesis word-for-word).
- Preview the main idea you will explain in that paragraph (one or two reasons).
- Use confident, concise language (avoid “I think,” “can,” or vague phrasing like “some extent”).

4) A short template to help you try a revision (fill the blanks):
- “[Claim about automation’s effect on jobs], because it [how it changes the work] and [second effect you will explain].”

Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence now? Paste your revised version (one sentence). I’ll give focused feedback and then we’ll move to Step 3 to improve that paragraph’s supporting sentences.

*Time:* 2025-11-25T03:58:28.026Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on

*Time:* 2025-11-25T04:01:33.243Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for saying “let’s move on.” Before I help revise the paragraph content, two quick checks so we stay focused:

1) Which 1–2 revision targets shall I focus on while we work on this paragraph?
- Evidence & development (make examples clearer and explain more)
- Grammar & word choice (fix articles, collocations, punctuation)
- Organisation/coherence within the paragraph
(Choose up to two.)

2) Which paragraph do you want to revise: paragraph 1 (meaningful work & productivity) or paragraph 2 (cooperating with AI / new jobs)? If you don’t pick, I’ll assume paragraph 1.

If you choose paragraph 1, here are four focused, actionable prompts to help you revise the supporting sentences. Try rewriting 2–3 sentences from that paragraph using these hints, and I’ll give feedback.

Focused guidance for paragraph 1
- Link each detail clearly to the topic sentence: after you state that automation improves work and motivation, explain exactly how that happens (e.g., automation removes repetitive tasks → workers spend time on creative/problem‑solving tasks → this raises productivity or job quality).
- Expand the example: don’t just name “carrying boxes.” Say what skills are freed and how those skills add value (planning, design, research, supervision). Briefly explain why that matters for employment.
- Fix word choice and grammar: replace awkward phrases with natural collocations:
  - “make more efficient” → “increase efficiency” or “improve productivity”
  - “less meanings work” → “less meaningful work”
  - “do some thing more meaningful” → “do more meaningful tasks”
  - “good mood sand meaningful mind” → “better morale and a greater sense of purpose”
  - “the automation replaces people to carry boxes” → “automation can replace manual tasks such as carrying boxes”
  - use “in the long term” (not “in long term”); use articles (“the long term” or “over time”)
- Add a short consequence sentence: after the example, say what this change leads to (e.g., higher productivity can lead to business growth and new roles).

A simple revision plan you can follow (try one sentence at a time)
1. Keep your revised topic sentence (we’re pretending it’s done).
2. Rewrite the first supporting sentence to state clearly how automation changes daily tasks and worker focus.
3. Rewrite the example sentence to show the task replaced and the higher‑value activities workers can do instead.
4. Add one short explanation sentence that links the example back to employment outcomes.

Would you like to try rewriting those supporting sentences now? Paste your new versions for 1–3 sentences and I’ll give focused feedback and small corrections.
