        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Great! Let's work together step by step to strengthen your essay so it meets the rubric criteria and improves your academic writing skills.

**Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**

Let’s focus on your thesis statement first. Please copy and paste your current thesis statement here so we can review it closely together.

Once you’ve shared it, I’ll provide feedback on clarity, strength, and focus, and then guide you to revise it before we move on.

Ready when you are!

*Time:* 2025-11-13T01:54:20.971Z

**You:** Some people believe that individual actions are insignificant in the fight against climate change compared to the efforts of governments and large corporations. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

*Time:* 2025-11-13T01:55:57.885Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement:

*“I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”*

Here’s my feedback:

**Strengths:**  
- You answer the essay question and present your viewpoint clearly (“I partly agree…”).
- You mention both influencing government and personal choices, showing preview of structure.

**Areas to improve:**  
- The thesis can be more direct and confident (avoid “I think”/“I believe”).
- Try to combine both main points smoothly and clearly.
- Consider using topic-specific language (e.g., “environmental policies,” “sustainable choices”).
- Aim for precise, academic phrasing and avoid vague modifiers such as “very important” and “less impactful.”

**Guiding questions to help revision:**  
- Can you state specifically how individuals influence climate change (via government *and* personal choices)?
- Can you use stronger, more academic language?
- Can you make your thesis preview the essay’s structure (i.e., mention both key areas)?

**Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now, aiming for a more confident and structured statement?**  
Feel free to share your revision and I will help you refine it before we move to the next step!

*Time:* 2025-11-13T01:56:01.575Z

**You:** Yes，I want you to rewrite a better one for me

*Time:* 2025-11-13T02:04:26.074Z

**Assistant:** I’m glad you’re ready to improve your thesis! However, my role is to guide you rather than rewrite it for you. This helps you build your writing skills, which is key to success in academic English.

Let’s work together. Here’s a short model thesis (not for direct copying, but to inspire you):

“While the actions of governments and corporations are essential in addressing climate change, individual citizens play a crucial role by influencing public policy and making sustainable lifestyle choices.”

Now, I encourage you to create your own improved thesis using clearer, more confident, and more academic language.  
Try including:

- A confident point of view (no “I think/I believe”).
- Both main points (government influence and personal choices).
- Topic-specific terms if possible.

**Would you like to try your own revision now?** Feel free to type your version—I’ll give feedback as soon as you share it!
