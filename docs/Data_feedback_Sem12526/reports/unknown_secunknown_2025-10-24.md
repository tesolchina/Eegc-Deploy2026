# Comprehensive IELTS Writing Task 2 Feedback Report

## 1) Student's Original Essay and Question

**Question:**  
The international community should act immediately to ensure that all countries reduce their consumption of fossil fuels, such as gas and oil. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Write at least 250 words.

**Student’s Essay:**  
> The escalating climate crisis, driven largely by greenhouse gas emissions, has prompted urgent calls for global cooperation to curb the use of fossil fuels. I strongly agree with the assertion that the international community must act immediately to ensure a worldwide reduction in the consumption of gas and oil.  
>  
> Firstly, the environmental necessity for immediate and collective action is undeniable. The burning of fossil fuels is the primary contributor to global warming, leading to a rise in extreme weather events, melting ice caps, and sea-level rise. These phenomena pose an existential threat to ecosystems and human settlements, particularly in low-lying island nations and coastal cities. If each country acts alone, without a coordinated framework, the efforts of some may be negated by the inaction of others. Therefore, a unified international approach, perhaps through binding agreements and shared technologies, is crucial to effectively and equitably distribute the responsibility of cutting emissions. This ensures that no single nation can free-ride on the efforts of the rest, making the global response more robust and effective.  
>  
> Secondly, transitioning away from fossil fuels presents significant long-term economic and public health advantages. While the initial investment in renewable energy infrastructure like solar, wind, and hydropower may be substantial, it leads to energy independence, price stability, and the creation of new, sustainable industries. In contrast, reliance on finite resources like oil and gas subjects national economies to volatile global markets and geopolitical strife. Furthermore, reducing fossil fuel consumption would drastically improve air quality in major cities, decreasing the incidence of respiratory diseases and associated healthcare costs. This shift is not merely an environmental ideal but a pragmatic step towards a more stable and healthier global society.  
>  
> In conclusion, I firmly believe that immediate and coordinated international action to reduce fossil fuel consumption is not only justified but essential. The severe and irreversible threats of climate change, coupled with the economic and health benefits of clean energy, leave no room for delay. The global community must unite to enforce and support this transition, ensuring a livable planet for future generations.

## 2) Detailed Feedback on IELTS Criteria

| **Criterion**                  | **Feedback**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Task Response (TR)**         | - **Strengths:** The essay directly addresses the question with a clear, strong position (agreement). Thoughtful, relevant arguments support the thesis, including environmental, economic, and health perspectives.<br> - **Improvements:** To advance, consider briefly acknowledging opposing views or potential challenges (counterarguments) to demonstrate a balanced and critical approach.                                                 |
| **Coherence & Cohesion (CC)**  | - **Strengths:** Logical overall structure with clear paragraphing. Effective use of linking phrases like “Firstly,” “Secondly,” and “In conclusion” guide the reader.<br> - **Improvements:** Topic sentences could be stronger to clearly outline paragraph focus, especially paragraph two (economic and health benefits). Some internal paragraph cohesion could be enhanced with more varied linking devices.                |
| **Lexical Resource (LR)**      | - **Strengths:** Good range of academic and topic-specific vocabulary (e.g., “greenhouse gas emissions,” “renewable energy infrastructure,” “energy independence”).<br> - **Improvements:** To raise lexical sophistication, incorporate more synonyms and expressions with subtle nuance (e.g., “catastrophic” instead of “severe,” “volatile” appears twice—consider alternatives). Also, avoid repeated phrases, aiming for variety.                            |
| **Grammatical Range & Accuracy (GRA)** | - **Strengths:** Sentence structures are varied and include complex forms, which enhances argument depth.<br> - **Improvements:** Minor issues with subject-verb agreement and punctuation were noted; careful proofreading to eliminate small errors will improve clarity and overall score.                                                                                                          |

The escalating climate crisis, driven largely by greenhouse gas emissions, has prompted urgent calls for global cooperation to curb the use of fossil fuels. I strongly agree with the assertion that the international community must act immediately to ensure a worldwide reduction in the consumption of gas and oil.

Firstly, the environmental necessity for immediate and collective action is undeniable. The burning of fossil fuels is the primary contributor to global warming, leading to a rise in extreme weather events, melting ice caps, and sea-level rise. These phenomena pose an existential threat to ecosystems and human settlements, particularly in low-lying island nations and coastal cities. If each country acts alone, without a coordinated framework, the efforts of some may be negated by the inaction of others.

This ensures that no single nation can free-ride on the efforts of the rest, making the global response more robust and effective.

Secondly, transitioning away from fossil fuels presents significant long-term economic and public health advantages. Although the initial investment in renewable energy infrastructure like solar, wind, and hydropower may be substantial, it leads to energy independence, price stability, and the creation of new, sustainable industries. In contrast, reliance on finite resources like oil and gas subjects national economies to volatile global markets and geopolitical strife.

The global community must unite to enforce and support this transition, ensuring a livable planet for future generations.

1. ✅ Three Strengths: Looking at my feedback and your original essay, what are three specific things you did well in this writing piece? (e.g., 'I successfully used a complex sentence structure in the introduction,' or 'My thesis statement was very clear.')

2. 💡 Three Areas for Improvement: What are the top three areas you need to focus on for your next essay? (e.g., 'I need to work on using more precise vocabulary instead of simple words,' or 'I must remember to check subject-verb agreement.')

3. 📝 Learning from the Sample: What are two or three specific techniques or elements from the Band 6.0 Sample that you can incorporate into your own writing? (e.g., 'I like how the sample used the phrase "a double-edged sword" as a metaphor, I can use that,' or 'The way the sample essay presented the counter-argument in paragraph 3 was very effective.')

4. ⚙️ Critiquing the Sample: Even a Band 6.0 sample isn't perfect. Can you identify one or two places where the Sample could be improved? (This develops your critical thinking. e.g., 'The conclusion could be more impactful,' or 'A more advanced synonym for "important" could have been used here.')

5. 🚀 Strategy Adjustment: Based on today's feedback, what is one immediate change you will make to your writing practice or preparation strategy?
