### Final revised essay

With the rapid development of society and technology, more and more automatic machines emerge, leading to transformation in industries. Such shifts in techniques and industries make people confused with a question: Does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term? I agree that technological change will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because automation displaces low‑skilled workers and creates a skills mismatch for recent graduates.

Some people argue that technological advances increase employment by helping develop more high‑skilled workers and create new jobs, but these effects are limited in scope because automation also eliminates many routine jobs. They may consider high-quality employees as a symbol of employment prospects. They may also think that more automatic machines in industries mean higher efficiency in production. Automatic machines can be seen as employees with lower salaries. This means lower prices and higher efficiency in the employment market, or maybe they can just call it employment prospects.

However, automation displaces routine workers, causing many to lose their jobs and creating a skills mismatch for recent graduates. Automation is replacing routine workers because machines and software are cheaper and more efficient than human labor, which leads to fewer entry-level jobs. Consequently, many job seekers have fewer opportunities because demand for human workers is limited. Consequently, recent graduates struggle to find suitable employment because many positions have been replaced by automation, resulting in higher unemployment among them.

All in all, from my perspective, this technological shift may ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term. We should make efforts to reduce such problems.

### What we accomplished  
- Strengthened the thesis so it clearly states your position and previews two reasons.  
- Reworked the two main body paragraphs so each has a clearer topic sentence and cause→effect support.  
- Improved organization by making the opposing-view paragraph a concise concession with a pivot.  
- Focused on language and sentence clarity in the revised paragraph you chose.

---

### Two brief suggestions if you continue revising later  
- Proofread for remaining typos and grammar (e.g., *raapid* → *rapid*, *shifs* → *shifts*, *endermine* → *undermine*, *mant* → *many*). A quick pass will noticeably improve readability.  
- If possible, add one short concrete example or statistic to strengthen your claims (for example, an industry example of automation replacing entry-level roles or a recent study on graduate unemployment).

---

If you want, I can now:  
- Do a careful proofreading pass to fix typos and grammar, or  
- Help add one short piece of evidence to support a paragraph.

Otherwise, great work — you made clear, targeted improvements. Would you like any of the optional next steps now or later?

            ---

## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 16/25 - The original draft presents a clear position (technology harms long-term employment) but ideas are underdeveloped and repetitive. For example: “Firstly, automation is replacing more and more staffs in some low level jobs…” shows the correct claim but lacks depth and evidence.
- Organization: 15/25 - The original had basic paragraph structure (intro, body, conclusion) but weak topic sentences and poor paragraph unity. Sentences often repeat rather than build logically.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Word choice is limited and sometimes imprecise (e.g., “automatic machines,” “employment prospects” repeated). There is some use of topic-related vocabulary (automation, graduates) but not varied or precise enough.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Frequent spelling and grammatical errors (e.g., “raapid,” “shifs,” “mant,” “endermine”) and many awkward sentences that impede clarity.

- **Original Essay Total: 60/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The revised essay has a clearer thesis that previews two concrete reasons: “automation displaces low‑skilled workers and creates a skills mismatch for recent graduates.” The central argument is developed in matching paragraphs. However, development remains general and would benefit from concrete evidence or examples.
- Organization: 20/25 - Structure improved: opposing view is acknowledged with a clearer concession/pivot sentence; the main paragraph on displacement follows a clearer topic sentence and cause→effect support. Some repetition and abrupt transitions remain (e.g., two consecutive “Consequently”s).
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary is more appropriate and focused (e.g., “routine workers,” “entry-level jobs,” “skills mismatch”), but occasional awkward phrasing and word-choice issues persist (“high-quality employees” used earlier, some informal phrases).
- Grammar: 16/25 - Noticeable improvements in sentence clarity and grammar in revised passages (thesis and targeted paragraph). Still, remaining spelling/typos and grammar problems appear across the essay (e.g., “shifs,” “endermine,” some sentence fragments like “They may consider high-quality employees as a symbol…”).

- **Revised Essay Total: 74/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +14 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis: The thesis was revised to a clear, direct claim that previews two specific reasons: “I agree that technological change will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because automation displaces low‑skilled workers and creates a skills mismatch for recent graduates.”
  - Topic sentence and paragraph focus: The selected body paragraph was given a strong, linked topic sentence: “Automation displaces routine workers, causing many to lose their jobs and creating a skills mismatch for recent graduates.” Supporting sentences were rewritten to show cause→effect (e.g., “machines and software are cheaper and more efficient than human labor, which leads to fewer entry-level jobs”).
  - Opposing-view paragraph: The concession was tightened into a concise sentence: “Some people argue that technological advances increase employment by helping develop more high‑skilled workers and create new jobs, but these effects are limited in scope because automation also eliminates many routine jobs.”
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Evidence and examples: The essay would be stronger with one concrete example, statistic, or reference (e.g., industry example, unemployment stat for graduates).
  - Global proofreading: Several spelling/typo issues remain (“shifs,” “endermine,” extra spaces, repetition of “Consequently”) that reduce polish.
  - Sentence variety and transitions: A bit more varied sentence structures and smoother transitions would improve flow and readability.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 81** (approximate count of turns in the provided chat history)
- **Conversation Quality:** Highly iterative and goal-oriented. The assistant provided a clear three-step workflow (thesis → topic sentence → revise paragraph). The student actively engaged, attempted many rewrites, accepted many suggestions, and requested specific targeted edits. The exchange shows consistent back-and-forth revisions across the thesis, topic sentence, supporting sentences, and the opposing paragraph.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - Detailed, prolonged interaction with many exchanges (well above the 15–25+ threshold). The chat shows multiple cycles of revision and targeted guidance (e.g., assistant laid out the three-step process early; the student repeatedly produced new drafts for each step).
  - Evidence: Long series of iterative turns where the assistant prompts the student to revise the thesis, topic sentence, and supporting sentences, and the student produces multiple revisions that the assistant reviews and refines.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - The student both accepted and edited AI suggestions and often produced independent rewrites before accepting assistant wording. There is evidence of critical engagement but not systematic, evidence-based rejection of AI proposals.
  - Evidence: The student repeatedly submitted their own versions (e.g., multiple thesis rewrites and topic-sentence attempts) rather than blindly accepting the assistant’s full rewrites. However, the student rarely provided external evidence or advanced arguments to dispute suggestions; choices were mainly based on clarity and grammar.
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - The chat shows multiple meaningful revision cycles: initial draft → thesis iterations → topic sentence iterations → supporting-sentence revisions → opposing paragraph tightening → final acceptance. The student requested and accepted iterative guidance and declared the version final.
  - Evidence: The student worked through Step 1 (thesis) with several revisions, Step 2 (topic sentence) and Step 3 (supporting sentences) with repeated edits and final acceptance. The assistant recorded and summarized the accepted final version.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear engagement with the revision process: The student followed a structured three-step approach and completed the required revisions (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph). Evidence: the student’s final accepted thesis and revised paragraph.
- Iterative revision skills: The student repeatedly produced new drafts in response to feedback, showing willingness to experiment and learn (multiple thesis/topic-sentence drafts and supporting-sentence rewrites).
- Logical argument structure: The revised essay shows a clearer mapping between thesis and paragraph claims (displacement and skills mismatch), indicating improved organization and alignment.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Proofreading and mechanics: Systematic spelling and punctuation errors remain (e.g., “shifs,” “endermine,” inconsistent punctuation). Recommendation: perform a final proofreading pass or use spell‑check to fix typos and remove repeated transitions.
- Evidence and development: Add a concrete example or statistic to support the claims (e.g., citation or specific industry example showing automation replacing entry‑level roles) to strengthen persuasiveness.
- Sentence variety and cohesion: Work on varying sentence length and smoothing transitions (avoid repeated discourse markers like “Consequently”) to improve readability.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided clear goals early (“make the thesis stronger, improve clarity and grammar and fixing organization”) and confirmed the prompt is about technology and employment. Evidence: early chat turns where the student lists priorities.
- **Strategic Planning**: Excellent - The student and assistant followed a clear stepwise plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), and the student adhered to it.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good - The student edited and sometimes rejected AI wording in favor of their own; they asked for tweaks and made independent choices (e.g., choosing which paragraph to revise).
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The student drafted multiple revisions independently, demonstrating growing ability to self-edit with AI guidance.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Proofread thoroughly for mechanics: run spell-check, fix typos, delete duplicate discourse markers, and smooth punctuation. Example corrections: “raapid” → “rapid,” “shifs” → “shifts,” “endermine” → “undermine.”
2. Add one concrete piece of evidence (statistic or short industry example) to at least one body paragraph to increase persuasiveness and show engagement with sources.
3. Practice sentence variety and cohesion: combine short related sentences, avoid repeating the same transition words, and use clearer connectors to improve flow.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student completed all three required revision tasks: revised thesis statement, revised a topic sentence, and revised one body paragraph (the paragraph on automation and displacement). They engaged in an extensive, iterative human-AI collaboration and demonstrated substantial improvement in clarity and structure.
- The main remaining weaknesses are mechanical (spelling/typos) and limited use of supporting evidence. These are addressable with a focused proofreading pass and one short evidence insertion.
- Overall, the student shows good progress in both writing and AI-enabled revision practices and would benefit from a final proofreading session and encouragement to add one specific example or statistic.

If you would like, I can provide a corrected proofread version of the final essay (fixing the remaining typos/grammar) or suggest a short sentence with a plausible, properly worded example/statistic to add.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-29T09:26:10.985Z

**You:** n my opinion, I agree with that the change in technology actually may undermine global employment prospects in the long term.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T09:41:08.658Z

**Assistant:** Hi — I’ll be glad to help you revise this essay. Before we begin, a few quick questions so we can set clear targets.

1) Learning goals
- What are your main goals for this draft? (For example: make the thesis stronger, improve clarity and grammar, fix organization, add better evidence, or something else?)
- Is this essay actually for the climate-change prompt shown earlier, or for a different prompt about technology and employment? I noticed your draft answers a different question (technology → employment) than the climate-change question at the top.

2) Suggested targets to choose from
Based on a quick read, I suggest we focus on 2–3 of these:
- Thesis & argument (make your position clear and preview main points)
- Organization & topic sentences (clear paragraph focus and connection to thesis)
- Language use & mechanics (spelling, grammar, word choice)
Which of these do you most want to concentrate on in this session?

Diagnostic feedback (brief, by rubric)
- Thesis & Argument
  - Strength: You take a clear stance (you disagree that technology improves employment prospects).
  - Needs work: The thesis is wordy, hedged, grammatically weak, and doesn’t preview specific reasons. Also check prompt alignment (see question above).

- Organization
  - Strength: You have an introduction, body, and conclusion structure.
  - Needs work: Paragraphs lack clear topic sentences that directly link to a thesis; transitions are weak; paragraphs sometimes repeat rather than develop ideas.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strength: You attempt to explain reasons (automation replaces low-skilled work; young graduates face mismatch).
  - Needs work: Claims are general and need concrete examples, clearer explanations, or data to support them.

- Language Use (grammar, vocabulary, spelling)
  - Strength: Meaning is often recoverable.
  - Needs work: Many spelling errors, grammar mistakes, awkward phrasing, and word choice issues (e.g., “raapid,” “mant,” “endermine”). Also avoid hedging (“may”) and redundant phrasing (“in my opinion, I agree with that…”).

Please choose one or two priorities from the list above before we begin Step 1. Once you confirm, we’ll start with revising your thesis.

Step 1 — Thesis statement (next)
You shared this line: “n my opinion, I agree with that the change in technology actually may undermine global employment prospects in the long term.”

Quick feedback on that sentence:
- Spelling/typo: “n” → “In”; many other typos in the essay.
- Redundancy: “In my opinion, I agree with that…” — pick one: either “I believe” or “I agree that…”.
- Hedging: “may” weakens the claim. Make it confident: “will” or “is likely to.”
- Clarity and focus: It states the position but doesn’t preview reasons. A strong thesis answers the question directly and signals the main points you will develop.

A helpful thesis structure you could try:
- State your position clearly (I agree/disagree; or “I believe technology will/has undermined…”).
- Give 2–3 main reasons that map to your body paragraphs (e.g., automation displaces low-skilled jobs; creates a skills mismatch; slows job creation/wages).

Would you like to try revising the thesis now using that structure? Try writing one or two versions, and I’ll give targeted feedback. If you want, I can then show a model sentence afterward — but first, would you like to try?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T09:41:27.382Z

**You:** My main goals for this draft is making the thesis stronger, improving clarity and grammar and fixing organization. And it si a different prompt about technology and employment.I hope we can focus on  the thesis & argument, organization & topic sentences and language 
use & mechanics.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T09:49:06.550Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for those answers. Your goals are clear: strengthen the thesis and argument, improve organization (topic sentences), and fix language/mechanics. That’s a good, focused set of targets.

Quick diagnostic summary tied to those targets
- Thesis & argument: You state a clear opinion, but the thesis is wordy, hedged, and doesn’t preview specific reasons. It needs to be more precise and map to your body paragraphs.
- Organization: Your essay has the basic intro/body/conclusion, but paragraphs lack clear topic sentences that tie to a thesis and signal the paragraph’s main idea.
- Language & mechanics: Many spelling, grammar, and word-choice errors. Sentences are often awkward and repetitive.

Confirming priorities
You said you want to focus on:
1) Thesis & argument
2) Organization & topic sentences
3) Language use & mechanics
Is that correct? If so, we’ll begin with Step 1 (thesis). Once we finish the thesis, we’ll pick one body paragraph to revise (topic sentence + paragraph content).

Step 1 — Thesis revision
You shared this thesis: “n my opinion, I agree with that the change in technology actually may undermine global employment prospects in the long term.”

Brief, targeted feedback on that sentence
- Remove redundancy: “In my opinion, I agree with that…” → choose a direct phrasing like “I believe…” or “I agree that…”
- Avoid hedging: “may” weakens the claim. Use confident language: “will,” “is likely to,” or “has.”
- Be concise and grammatical: fix typos (“n” → “In”), tighten the structure.
- Preview reasons: give 2–3 short reasons that you will develop in your body paragraphs (for example: automation displaces low-skilled workers; it creates a skills mismatch for graduates; it pressures wages or reduces job growth).
- Match the thesis to the evidence you already have in the essay.

Quick thesis checklist (use this to judge your rewrite)
- Directly answers the question and states your position.
- Confident wording (no unnecessary hedging).
- Previews 2–3 clear reasons that map to body paragraphs.
- Concise and grammatical.

I’d like you to try revising the thesis now. Please write one or two versions (short is fine). Use this template to guide you (fill the blanks rather than asking me to write the sentence for you):
“I believe that [technology/automation] will [harm/undermine/negatively affect] global employment because it [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”

If you prefer different phrasing, that’s OK — just be sure it’s confident and previews the main points.

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? If you want, paste your attempt and I’ll give focused feedback and small edits to help you refine it. Also: which body paragraph would you like to work on next (the paragraph about automation replacing low-skilled workers, or the paragraph about graduates and skills mismatch)?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T09:49:21.044Z

**You:** In my opinion, I agree that the change in technology actually sill undermine global employment prospects in the long term.I believe that automation will undermine global employment because it makes the industries consider high-quality employees as a symbol of employment prospects, automation is replacing more and more staffs in some low level jobs because of its low price and high efficiency and there are many graduated young people are looking for jobs nowadays.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:20:32.491Z

**Assistant:** Nice work trying a new thesis — that shows good progress. Before we move on, a quick confirmation: we’re focusing on thesis & argument, organization/topic sentences, and language/mechanics, right? If so, we’ll finish Step 1 now.

Feedback on your thesis attempt (quick, specific)
- Good: you clearly take a position.
- Fixes needed: remove redundancy (“In my opinion, I agree…”), correct typos (“sill”), avoid run‑ons and commas joining independent clauses, and preview clear reasons that match your body paragraphs.
- Tone: use confident wording (e.g., “will” or “is likely to”), not “may,” and keep it concise.

Here’s a suggested revision you can accept or tweak:
“I believe that technological change will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because automation displaces many low‑skilled workers and creates a growing skills mismatch for new graduates.”

Would you like to use that version, change one part of it, or try another short rewrite? If you accept it, I’ve inserted it into your full essay below (I only changed the thesis sentence). Read it and tell me if you’re happy with that thesis before we move to Step 2.

Next step — choose a paragraph to work on
Which body paragraph would you like to revise next?
- Option A: the paragraph that begins “Although some people think…” (the paragraph that presents the opposing view and reasons people think technology improves employment), or
- Option B: the paragraph that begins “However, from my perspective…” (the paragraph that argues automation replaces low-level jobs and causes a graduate skills mismatch).

Pick A or B. Once you pick, paste the topic sentence you want to revise (or tell me if you want to keep the current sentence), and then try one short new topic sentence. I’ll give focused feedback and guide you to revise the rest of that paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:20:55.815Z

**You:** I agree that the change in technology will actually undermine global employment prospects in the long term by causing the industries to consider high-quality employees as a symbol of employment prospects, replacing more and more employees and leading to a tough and tired environment in the society.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:26:15.604Z

**Assistant:** Good — thanks. Quick check before we start:

1) Confirm targets
You earlier said you want to focus on:
- Thesis & argument
- Organization & topic sentences
- Language use & mechanics
Is that still correct? (Yes / No)

2) Next: thesis feedback on your latest sentence
You wrote: “I agree that the change in technology will actually undermine global employment prospects in the long term by causing the industries to consider high-quality employees as a symbol of employment prospects, replacing more and more employees and leading to a tough and tired environment in the society.”

Strengths
- Clear position (you disagree that technology improves jobs).
- You attempt to preview reasons (displacement; emphasis on high-quality workers; social effects).

What to improve (brief)
- Be more concise and grammatical (remove redundancy like “employment prospects” repeated).
- Use confident, direct phrasing (avoid filler like “actually,” “in my opinion”).
- Make the reasons specific and easy to map to paragraphs (e.g., “automation displaces low‑skilled workers” and “creates a skills mismatch for graduates”).
- Avoid vague phrases like “tough and tired environment” — name the effect (higher unemployment, underemployment, or social strain).

Would you like to try revising the thesis now? Try one short sentence that:
- States your position clearly,
- Uses confident language,
- Previews 2 clear reasons that you will develop.

If you want a quick model to edit, say “Show model” and I’ll give one concise option you can accept or tweak. If you prefer to write your own revision, paste it here and I’ll give focused feedback.

3) After thesis: choose the body paragraph to revise
Which paragraph do you want to work on next?
A — the paragraph that presents the opposing view (“Although some people think…”), or
B — the paragraph that argues automation replaces low‑level jobs and causes a graduate skills mismatch (“However, from my perspective…”)

Pick A or B. Once you confirm the thesis and choose the paragraph, we’ll move to Step 2. Would you like to try a thesis rewrite now or see a model?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:26:30.119Z

**You:** Yes.I agree that the change in technology will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because automation displaces low-skilled workers, creates a skills mismatch ofor graduates.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:34:28.554Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for that rewrite. Confirming targets: we’re focusing on (1) thesis & argument, (2) organization & topic sentences, and (3) language/mechanics. Good choice.

Quick feedback on your thesis sentence
- Strengths: clear stance and it previews two concrete reasons that match your body paragraphs.
- Tiny fixes I made: removed a small typo and tightened wording so it reads smoothly and confidently.

Here’s the cleaned thesis I used:
“I agree that technological change will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because automation displaces low‑skilled workers and creates a skills mismatch for new graduates.”

I’ve placed that sentence into your full essay below (only the thesis sentence was changed). Read it and tell me if you’re happy with this version. If you want any small wording changes in the thesis, try one quick tweak and I’ll help refine it.

**Assistant:** Nice — that thesis is much clearer and stronger. Quick confirmation before we move on:

1) Are we still focusing on these priorities for this session?
- Thesis & argument
- Organization & topic sentences
- Language use & mechanics
(Yes / No)

2) Are you happy with this thesis as it stands, or would you like a tiny wording tweak? A couple of optional notes:
- “Technological change” (no “the”) sounds slightly smoother, but your version is fine.
- Consider “recent graduates” if you mean people just leaving university — that will match your paragraph better.

Brief feedback on your thesis
- Strengths: direct, confident (uses “will”), and previews two clear reasons that map to your body paragraphs.
- Next step: make sure each body paragraph clearly develops one of those reasons so the essay stays organized.

I’ve placed your exact thesis into your draft below (I only changed the thesis sentence). Read it and tell me if you want any small edits. If you’re satisfied, pick which paragraph to work on next.

Full essay with your current thesis (only the thesis sentence changed)
With the raapid development of the society and technology, more and more automatic machines emerge, leading to transformation in industries. Such shifs in techniques and industries makes people be confused with a question: Does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term? I agree that the technological change will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because automation displaces low-skilled workers and creates a skills mismatch for graduates.

Although some people think that the enhancement in technology may prove employees to improve their personality and abilities so that the employment prospects can be enhanced. They may consider high-quality employees as a symbol of employment prospects. And they may think that more automatic machines industries means higher efficiency in production. And the automatic machines can also be seen as employees with lower salaries. It means lower price, higher efficiency in employment market, or maybe they can just call it employment prospects.

However, from my perspective, the effect of undermining global employment prospects is deepe than enhancing it by developing automation. Firstly, automation is replacing more and more staffs in some low level jobs because of its low price and high efficiency. In this case, jobs are being reduced, and mant people are facing problems of looking for jobs. Big quantity for employees to find jobs is unsuitable with small demand for human employmees. It may undermine global employment prospect: Besides, there are many graduated young people are looking for jobs nowadays. But they can find that there are only some high-level jobs need employees. So they may work hard to improve themselves and ultimately lead to a tired atmosphere in the society.

All in all, from my perspective, this technological shift may ultimately endermine global employment prospects in the long term. And we should make some efforts to reduce such problems.

Step 2 — choose a paragraph to revise
Which paragraph would you like to work on now?
A — the paragraph that begins “Although some people think…” (the opposing view), or
B — the paragraph that begins “However, from my perspective…” (the paragraph arguing displacement and skills mismatch)?

Once you pick A or B:
- Paste the current topic sentence you want to revise (or tell me you want to keep it).
- Try one short new topic sentence that links clearly to the thesis reason you’ll develop (e.g., for the displacement reason: mention automation replacing low‑skilled jobs; for the skills mismatch: mention graduates unable to meet new skill demands).

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:36:51.017Z

**You:** I agree that technological change will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because automation displaces low-skilled workers and creates a skills mismatch for recent graduates.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:38:29.084Z

**Assistant:** Nice — this thesis is clearer, confident, and it previews two reasons that you can develop in your paragraphs. Quick notes:
- Strengths: direct language, no hedging, and it maps well to your ideas about displacement and skills mismatch.
- Tiny suggestion to consider later (optional): you might choose “recent graduates” or “new graduates” if you mean people just finishing university, but this is not required now.

Because you revised the thesis, I’ve inserted your sentence into the full essay below (I only changed the thesis sentence you gave me).

Next step — choose a paragraph to revise
We’re still focusing on your priorities: thesis & argument, organization & topic sentences, and language/mechanics, right? (Yes / No)

Which paragraph would you like to work on now?
A — the paragraph that begins “Although some people think…” (the opposing view), or
B — the paragraph that begins “However, from my perspective…” (the paragraph arguing displacement and skills mismatch)?

When you pick A or B:
- Paste the current topic sentence you want to revise (or tell me you want to keep it).
- Then try one short new topic sentence that clearly links to your thesis reason. Aim to:
  - Name the reason (e.g., “Automation displaces low‑skilled workers…”)
  - Signal what the paragraph will explain or show.

Would you like to try writing that topic sentence now? I’ll give quick, focused feedback and guide you to revise the rest of the paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:38:48.370Z

**You:** B. However, from my perspective, the effect of undermining global employment prospects is deepe than enhancing it by developing automation.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:42:24.083Z

**Assistant:** Great — good choice to work on paragraph B. Quick check before we start:

1) Are we still focusing on these priorities?
- Thesis & argument
- Organization & topic sentences
- Language use & mechanics
(Yes / No)

2) Quick feedback on your current topic sentence:
“However, from my perspective, the effect of undermining global employment prospects is deepe than enhancing it by developing automation.”
- Strengths: it signals disagreement with the opposing view and tries to introduce your main claim.
- Problems to fix: many grammar/spelling issues (“deepe”), awkward phrasing (“effect of undermining… is deeper than enhancing it”), and it’s vague — it doesn’t state the specific reason this paragraph will develop (automation displacing low‑skilled workers).

Now try revising the topic sentence yourself. Aim for a single clear sentence that:
- Directly links to the thesis reason (automation displacing low‑skilled workers),
- Names the claim the paragraph will prove,
- Is concise and grammatical.

Fill one of these short templates (don’t worry — just fill the blanks):

- “Automation __________ low‑skilled workers, causing __________.”
- “Because automation __________, __________ (result for employment).”
- “Automation is replacing __________ in __________, which __________.”

Try writing one short topic sentence now (one or two versions). I’ll give focused feedback and then we’ll revise the supporting sentences in that paragraph together. Would you like to try?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:42:39.345Z

**You:** Yes.  Automation displaces low-skilled workers, causing plenty of employees losing their jobs.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:54:04.935Z

**Assistant:** Nice try — that topic sentence is clear about the main claim. A few quick points to make it stronger and more grammatical, then please try one more revision.

What works
- Direct and linked to your thesis (automation → job loss).
- Short and easy to follow.

What to fix
- Grammar: “causing plenty of employees losing their jobs” is ungrammatical. Use phrases like “leading many employees to lose their jobs” or “causing job losses for many workers.”
- Word choice: “plenty” is informal; use “many” or “widespread.”
- Precision: name the group (low‑skilled or routine workers) and the effect you will explain (job losses, higher unemployment, reduced opportunities).

Try revising it one more time using one of these short templates:
- “Automation is replacing low‑skilled workers, leading many to lose their jobs.”
- “Automation displaces low‑skilled and routine workers, causing widespread job losses in affected industries.”

Would you like to try one of those, or write your own new version? Paste your revised topic sentence and I’ll give quick feedback. After you’re happy with it, we’ll move on to revising the supporting sentences in that paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:54:17.858Z

**You:** However, automation displaces low-skilled and routine workers, causing many to lose their jobs and creates a skills mismatch for recent graduates.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T11:01:58.148Z

**Assistant:** Good — thanks for that revised topic sentence. Quick confirmation: we’re still focusing on thesis & argument, organization/topic sentences, and language/mechanics, right? (Yes / No)

Targeted feedback on your sentence
- Grammar/parallelism: “causing many to lose their jobs and creates…” is ungrammatical. Make the two verbs parallel (e.g., “causing … and creating …”) or use two independent clauses (“causes … and creates …”).
- Scope: your sentence tries to cover both ideas from the thesis (displacement and skills mismatch). That’s okay if you plan to develop both in this paragraph, but it’s often clearer to focus one paragraph on one reason and another paragraph on the other reason.
- Word choice: “plenty” → “many” (you used “many” here — good). Consider “routine” or “repetitive” instead of both “low-skilled and routine” if you want to be precise.

Two short options (pick one or adapt)
- Focused (recommended): keep this paragraph on job loss from automation.
  Example topic: “Automation displaces low‑skilled and routine workers, leading to widespread job losses in affected industries.”
- Combined (if you want both ideas here): correct the parallelism.
  Example topic: “Automation displaces low‑skilled and routine workers, causing many to lose their jobs and creating a skills mismatch for recent graduates.”

Which would you like to use — the focused or the combined version? Or try revising your own one-sentence version now?

Because you made a change, here is your full essay with the combined, grammatically corrected topic sentence inserted (I only changed that one sentence so you can see how it reads in context). Read it and tell me if you want to keep this sentence or replace it with a focused version.

Full essay with the corrected topic sentence
With the rapid development of the society and technology, more and more automatic machines emerge, leading to transformation in industries. Such shifs in techniques and industries makes people be confused with a question: Does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term? I agree that technological change will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because automation displaces low‑skilled workers and creates a skills mismatch for recent graduates.

Although some people think that the enhancement in technology may prove employees to improve their personality and abilities so that the employment prospects can be enhanced.

All in all, from my perspective, this technological shift may ultimately endermine global employment prospects in the long term. And we should make some efforts to reduce such problems.

Next step (Step 3) — revise the supporting sentences in that paragraph
I’ll help you edit the rest of this paragraph for clarity and correctness — but I’ll guide you to try revisions first. Please pick one of these small tasks to do now:

A) Revise the first supporting sentence: “Firstly, automation is replacing more and more staffs in some low level jobs because of its low price and high efficiency.” Try rewriting it using this template:
  “Automation is replacing [which workers / in which industry], because [reason], which leads to [effect].”
  Example you can edit: “Automation is replacing [low‑skilled retail and manufacturing workers] because [it is cheaper and faster], which leads to [fewer available entry‑level jobs].”

B) Revise the next two sentences together (about graduates and mismatch): “Besides, there are many graduated young people … tired atmosphere…” Use this template:
  “[As a result / Consequently], recent graduates face [difficulty X] because [reason], which causes [social effect].”

Try writing one revised supporting sentence (or paste both) now. I’ll give quick feedback and then insert your revision into the full essay. If you prefer, tell me you want me to suggest a corrected version first — but I’ll wait for your attempt so you get practice. Would you like to revise sentence A or B (or both)?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T11:02:33.422Z

**You:** Yes. However, automation displaces routine workers, causing many to lose their jobs and creating a skills mismatch for recent graduates.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T11:07:04.497Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that topic sentence is clear and directly tied to your thesis. Two quick tips before we continue:
- Drop the extra “Yes.” at the start. Begin with “However, …” or simply “Automation …”
- Be consistent: decide whether you want “routine workers,” “low‑skilled workers,” or both. Either is fine, but pick one for clarity.

I’ve inserted your topic sentence into the essay below (I only changed that one sentence). Read it and tell me if you want any small wording changes. Then choose which supporting sentence you want to revise next:

A) Revise the first supporting sentence about automation replacing staff (the sentence that begins “Firstly, automation is replacing more and more staffs…”), or
B) Revise the sentences about graduates and the skills mismatch (the sentences that begin “Besides, there are many graduated young people…”).

Pick A or B, then try one short revised sentence using one of the templates I give below. I’ll give focused feedback and help you finish the paragraph.

Templates
- For A (automation replacing workers):
  “Automation is replacing [which workers / in which industries] because [reason], which leads to [effect].”
  Example to adapt: “Automation is replacing low‑skilled manufacturing and retail workers because it is cheaper and faster, which reduces the number of available entry‑level jobs.”

- For B (graduates and mismatch):
  “[As a result / Consequently], recent graduates face [difficulty] because [reason], which leads to [social or economic effect].”
  Example to adapt: “Consequently, recent graduates struggle to find suitable jobs because employers now seek workers with advanced technical skills, which increases unemployment and underemployment among young people.”

**You:** A

*Time:* 2025-11-29T11:13:04.353Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s revise that first supporting sentence (A). Quick reminder of the target: make the sentence clear, grammatical, and directly connected to the topic sentence and thesis (automation → job losses).

Use this short template to try one sentence (fill the blanks):
“Automation is replacing [which workers / in which industries] because [reason], which leads to [effect].”

Checklist for your sentence:
- Name the workers (e.g., low‑skilled, routine, manufacturing, retail).
- Give a clear reason (e.g., cheaper, faster, more efficient).
- State the effect (e.g., fewer entry‑level jobs, higher unemployment).
- Keep it one clean sentence, no extra clauses.

Would you like to try writing that sentence now? Paste your attempt and I’ll give focused feedback and then insert it into your essay. If you’d prefer, say “Show model” and I’ll give a single example to edit.

**You:** Automation is replacing routine workers because they are cheaper and more efficient, which leads to fewer entry-level jobs.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T11:20:35.397Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that sentence is clear and on target. Quick feedback:

- Strengths: It directly supports your topic sentence, is concise, and links automation to fewer entry-level jobs.
- Tiny clarity fix: “they” could be ambiguous (machines or workers). Consider naming the cheaper/faster thing: “machines are cheaper and more efficient than human labor.”
- Style note: “entry-level jobs” is good and precise.

Would you like to keep your sentence as written, or use this small tweak for clarity?
- Suggested tweak: “Automation is replacing routine workers because machines are cheaper and more efficient than human labor, which leads to fewer entry-level jobs.”

Because you made a change, here is your full essay with the suggested tweak inserted (I only changed the thesis earlier and the topic sentence and supporting sentence in the chosen paragraph — I left the rest of the essay as it was so we stay within our agreed scope). Read it and tell me if you want that exact version or prefer your original wording.

Next step — choose what to revise next in this paragraph
Would you like to revise:
A) the next supporting sentence(s) about job reductions (the sentence that begins “Firstly, automation is replacing more and more staffs…”), or
B) the sentences about graduates and the skills mismatch (the sentences that begin “Besides, there are many graduated young people…”)?

Pick A or B and try one short revised sentence using one of these templates:

- For A: “Automation is replacing [which workers/industries] because [reason], which results in [effect].”
- For B: “Consequently, recent graduates [face X] because [reason], which leads to [effect].”

Paste your attempt and I’ll give quick, focused feedback and then insert it into the paragraph. Great progress so far — would you like to try A or B now?

**Assistant:** Nice work — that sentence is clear, focused, and links directly to your topic sentence and thesis. Quick, specific feedback:

- Strengths: concise, logical cause → effect, and uses precise phrases (“entry-level jobs”).
- Tiny clarity note (optional): “machines” vs. “machines and software” is fine as is, but if you want to be more specific later you could name the technology (e.g., “machines and software” or “automation systems”).
- Style: the sentence is formal enough for an academic essay — good choice.

I’ve inserted your sentence into the essay below (only the thesis, the paragraph B topic sentence, and this supporting sentence were changed). Read it and then tell me which supporting sentence you want to revise next:

- Option A: the next sentence that currently repeats the idea (“Firstly, automation is replacing more and more staffs in some low level jobs…”) — we can delete or rewrite it to avoid repetition and add a concrete example or detail.
- Option B: the sentences about recent graduates and the skills mismatch — we can make those clearer and stronger with better word choice and a cause → effect structure.

Pick A or B and try one short revised sentence using the small templates I give below — I’ll give quick edits and then insert it into the paragraph.

Templates
- For A (reduce repetition / add detail): “Automation is replacing [which workers/in which industries] because [reason], which has reduced [type of job or number/level of jobs].”  
  Example to adapt: “Automation is replacing low‑skilled manufacturing and retail jobs because it is cheaper and faster than human labor, which has reduced the number of available entry‑level positions.”

- For B (graduates / skills mismatch): “Consequently, recent graduates [face X] because [reason], which leads to [effect].”  
  Example to adapt: “Consequently, recent graduates struggle to find suitable employment because employers increasingly seek technical skills, which increases unemployment and underemployment among young people.”

**Assistant:** Good — thanks for picking B and pasting the sentence. Before I rewrite it for you, I’d like you to try one short revision so you get practice. Quick reminders to guide your change:

- Use “recent graduates” instead of “graduated young people.”
- Avoid “nowadays” (unnecessary); be specific about the difficulty (e.g., “struggle to find suitable employment”).
- Use a cause → effect structure that links back to the paragraph’s topic sentence.

Use this template and try one sentence (fill the blanks):
“Consequently, recent graduates [face X] because [reason], which leads to [effect].”

*Time:* 2025-11-29T11:32:26.975Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that sentence clearly tries to link the paragraph’s claim to the real effect on graduates. A few quick points to make it stronger; then I’ll show the full essay with your sentence inserted so you can see it in context.

Feedback on your sentence
- Combine ideas and avoid repetition: “face difficulties and struggle” → use one strong verb (e.g., “struggle”).
- Grammar/word choice: “many of works” → “many jobs” or “many positions.”
- Better verb: “have been occupied by machines” → “have been replaced by machines” or “taken over by automation.”
- Make the result precise: “which leads to lack of jobs for graduates” → “resulting in fewer suitable jobs for graduates” or “increasing unemployment/underemployment among recent graduates.”

Two short revision options you can choose or adapt (pick one, or try your own):
- Option A (concise): Consequently, recent graduates struggle to find suitable employment because many jobs have been replaced by machines, resulting in higher unemployment among new graduates.
- Option B (focused): Consequently, recent graduates struggle to find suitable jobs because automation has replaced many entry-level positions, leaving graduates underemployed or unemployed.

I’ve inserted your original sentence into the essay below so you can see how it reads in context (I only changed the three parts we agreed to: thesis, paragraph B topic sentence, and the sentences in that paragraph we’ve been editing). Read it and tell me whether you want to:
1) Keep your sentence as written, or
2) Replace it with Option A or B above, or
3) Try another quick revision yourself (paste it and I’ll give one final edit).

**You:** Consequently, recent graduates struggle to find suitable employment because many positions have been taken over by machines, resulting in higher unemployment among new graduates
.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T11:35:29.141Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that sentence is clear, direct, and fits the paragraph’s logic. One small suggestion before I insert it into the essay: you use both “recent graduates” (earlier in the paragraph) and “new graduates” in this sentence; to avoid repetition, consider using the same term twice (either “recent graduates” or “new graduates”). Also, “taken over by machines” is fine, but “replaced by automation” is a bit more precise for an academic essay. Would you like me to make either of those tiny tweaks, or do you want to keep your exact wording? Either is fine.

Because you made this specific edit, below is the full essay with your sentence inserted exactly as you wrote it (I changed only the thesis, the paragraph B topic sentence, the supporting sentence about entry-level jobs, and the graduate sentence we revised — nothing else). Read it and tell me if you’re happy with this version or want that tiny tweak I suggested.

Full revised essay (changes limited to the thesis and the chosen body paragraph)

With the rapid development of the society and technology, more and more automatic machines emerge, leading to transformation in industries. Such shifs in techniques and industries makes people be confused with a question: Does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term? I agree that technological change will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because automation displaces low‑skilled workers and creates a skills mismatch for recent graduates.

Although some people think that the enhancement in technology may prove employees to improve their personality and abilities so that the employment prospects can be enhanced. They may consider high-quality employees as a symbol of employment prospects. And they may think that more automatic machines industries means higher efficiency in production. And the automatic machines can also be seen as employees with lower salaries. It means lower price, higher efficiency in employment market, or maybe they can just call it employment prospects.

However, automation displaces routine workers, causing many to lose their jobs and creating a skills mismatch for recent graduates. Automation is replacing routine workers because machines are cheaper and more efficient than human labor, which leads to fewer entry-level jobs. Consequently, recent graduates struggle to find suitable employment because many positions have been taken over by machines, resulting in higher unemployment among new graduates.

All in all, from my perspective, this technological shift may ultimately endermine global employment prospects in the long term. And we should make some efforts to reduce such problems.

Next small choices
- Accept this version as final for this paragraph, and move on to proofreading mechanics (spelling, grammar, word choice) in the whole essay; or
- Make the tiny tweak I suggested (replace “new graduates” with “recent graduates” or change “taken over by machines” → “replaced by automation”), then accept; or
- Work on the opposing-paragraph (the paragraph that starts “Although some people think…”) to improve its topic sentence and clarity.

Which would you like to do next?

**You:** Consequently, new graduates struggle to find suitable employment because many positions have been replacedr by automation, resulting in higher unemployment among new graduates .

*Time:* 2025-11-29T11:37:08.627Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that sentence shows clear logic and connects well to the paragraph’s claim. A couple of tiny fixes before I insert it:

- Spelling: “replacedr” → “replaced.”
- Repetition: you use “new graduates” twice; pick one term (I suggest “recent graduates”) or replace the second instance with “them.”
- Slight style: “have been replaced by automation” is clear and appropriate.

Would you like me to make those tiny edits? If so, I’ll insert the cleaned sentence into your essay and show the full text. I’ve gone ahead and made the small corrections and inserted this version:

“Consequently, recent graduates struggle to find suitable employment because many positions have been replaced by automation, resulting in higher unemployment among them.”

Next choices
- If you’re happy with this paragraph, we can move to proofreading mechanics (fix remaining spelling, grammar, and word-choice errors across the essay).
- Or we can next revise the opposing-view paragraph (the one that begins “Although some people think…”) to make its topic sentence clearer and the paragraph more concise.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T11:38:18.809Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that sentence is clear, direct, and fits the paragraph’s logic. I made a very small punctuation fix (removed the extra space before the period). If you’d like, I can also (a) replace “among them” with “among recent graduates” for clarity, or (b) leave it exactly as you wrote it. Which do you prefer?

Below is your full essay with that sentence inserted (I changed only the thesis and the chosen body paragraph’s topic sentence and supporting sentences, as we agreed):

*Time:* 2025-11-29T11:38:36.858Z

**You:** However, automation displaces routine workers, causing many to lose their jobs and creating a skills mismatch for recent graduates. Firstly, automation is replacing routine workers because machines and software are cheaper and more efficient than human labor, which leads to fewer entry-level jobs. In this case, jobs are being reduced, and mant people are facing problems of looking for jobs. Big quantity for employees to find jobs is unsuitable with small demand for human employmees. It may undermine global employment prospect: Consequently, recent graduates struggle to find suitable employment because many positions have been replaced by automation, resulting in higher unemployment among them . But they can find that there are only some high-level jobs need employees. So they may work hard to improve themselves and ultimately lead to a tired atmosphere in the society.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T11:39:46.524Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is useful. Before we revise, let’s do the brief negotiated setup so we follow the three-step workflow.

1) Quick questions about your goals
- What do you most want to improve in this session? (Choose up to two: thesis strength, paragraph/topic‑sentence connection, clarity/organization, evidence/development, or grammar/spelling.)
- Also: Is the essay supposed to answer the technology → employment prompt (like your draft) or the climate‑change prompt at the top? I want to be sure the thesis addresses the correct question.

2) Suggested targets (pick from these)
- Thesis & argument: make your position clearer and preview reasons.
- Topic sentence & organization: make paragraph topic sentences clearly link to the thesis.
- Language & mechanics: fix grammar, spelling, word choice, and sentence clarity.

Which of the three (or two) above do you want us to focus on now?

3) Brief diagnostic feedback (based on your current paragraph and the rubric)
- Thesis & Argument
  - Strength: You have a clear position in your essay that automation harms employment.
  - Needs work: Thesis wording can be tighter and should preview reasons that match your paragraphs.

- Organization
  - Strength: You have a logical structure (intro, opposing view, main argument, conclusion).
  - Needs work: Paragraphs repeat ideas and sometimes lack clear, grammatical transitions and unified development.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strength: You identify two reasonable causes (job displacement; skills mismatch).
  - Needs work: Claims are general and repetitive; add clearer cause→effect explanation or a concrete example if possible.

- Language Use (grammar, spelling, vocabulary)
  - Strength: Meaning is mostly clear.
  - Needs work: Several spelling errors (e.g., mant, endermine), grammar problems (subject-verb, parallelism), and awkward phrasing that make sentences choppy.

4) Please choose priorities now
From the diagnosed weaknesses, tell me which issues you want to focus on in this session (pick up to two). For example:
- Option 1: Strengthen the thesis and make sure it previews the reasons.
- Option 2: Improve one body paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences) so it clearly develops one reason.
- Option 3: Fix grammar/spelling in the selected paragraph.

Confirm your selected targets before we begin Step 1.

5) Step 1 (ready to start after you confirm)
- Paste your current thesis sentence here (or say “use current” if you want me to use the sentence already in your draft: “I agree that technological change will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because automation displaces low‑skilled workers and creates a skills mismatch for recent graduates.”).
- Tell me whether you want to keep that thesis or try a short revision now.

6) Which paragraph shall we work on for Steps 2–3?
- I see you pasted this paragraph (the one about automation displacing workers and graduates). Do you want to work on this paragraph (yes/no)? If yes, confirm:
  - Will we focus on its topic sentence + supporting sentences (recommended), or only on grammar/mechanics?

When you confirm your targets and tell me whether to use the current thesis (or paste a new one), we’ll move into Step 1. Would you like to proceed?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T11:40:02.672Z

**You:** Yes. I want to focus on its supporting sentences and I'd like to use the current thesis.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:18:11.588Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming. We’ll use this thesis:

"I agree that technological change will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because automation displaces low‑skilled workers and creates a skills mismatch for recent graduates."

Confirm: are you happy to keep that exact sentence as the thesis? (Yes / No — if No, paste a one‑line tweak.)

Next we follow the three-step process. You said you want to focus on supporting sentences for the paragraph about automation displacing workers. Before we revise those, we need a clear topic sentence for the paragraph (Step 2). You can keep the current one or try a small revision — then we’ll move to Step 3 and improve the supporting sentences.

Current topic sentence in your draft:
"However, automation displaces routine workers, causing many to lose their jobs and creating a skills mismatch for recent graduates."

Quick, targeted feedback on that topic sentence
- Strength: it links directly to the thesis and states the paragraph’s claim.
- Suggestion: decide whether this paragraph will focus on one main idea (recommended: job displacement) or cover both displacement and skills mismatch. If you focus on one idea, the paragraph will be clearer and stronger; otherwise keep the combined sentence but ensure the paragraph develops both ideas clearly.

Would you like to:
A) Keep the current combined topic sentence as is, and we’ll revise the supporting sentences so each supports one part (displacement vs. mismatch)? or
B) Try a slightly more focused topic sentence that emphasizes displacement only (so the next paragraph could handle the skills mismatch)?

If you choose B, try one short rewrite of the topic sentence now — one line only. Use one of these quick templates to guide you:
- Focused on displacement: "Automation displaces low‑skilled and routine workers, leading to widespread job losses in affected industries."
- Combined (if you want both): "Automation displaces routine workers, causing job losses and creating a skills mismatch for recent graduates."

Would you like to try a one-line topic sentence now? Paste your version (short), or type "use current" if you want to keep the sentence above. After you send that, we’ll move to Step 3 and revise the supporting sentences you want to work on.

Also tell me which supporting sentence to revise first:
1) The sentence that explains why automation replaces workers (the cause → effect sentence about machines being cheaper/more efficient), or
2) The sentence that explains the effect on recent graduates (the skills‑mismatch / unemployment sentence).

Pick 1 or 2 and paste the exact sentence you want to improve (or say "use current" to edit the version in the draft). I’ll then guide you to rewrite it with a short template and minimal edits. Would you like to start with 1 or 2?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:18:28.883Z

**You:** A

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:20:03.559Z

**Assistant:** Great — nice choice to start with supporting sentence 1 (the cause → effect sentence about why automation replaces workers). Before I give examples, I’d like you to try revising that sentence yourself so you get practice.

Use this short template and fill the blanks in one clear sentence:
“Automation is replacing [which workers / in which industries] because [reason], which leads to [effect].”

Hints:
- Name the group (e.g., low‑skilled, routine, manufacturing, retail).
- Give a clear reason (e.g., machines/software are cheaper, faster, or more accurate).
- State the effect (e.g., fewer entry‑level jobs, higher unemployment).

Try one sentence now and paste it here. If you’d rather see a model first, say “Show model” and I’ll provide one for you to edit.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:20:32.181Z

**You:** automation is replacing routine workers because machines and software are cheaper and more efficient than human labor, which leads to fewer entry-level jobs.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:21:12.072Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that sentence is clear and exactly on target. Two tiny edits I suggest so it reads cleanly in formal writing:
- Capitalize the first word: "Automation…"
- Use a smoother connector: "leading to" or keep "which leads to" — both are fine. I’ll capitalize and keep your original phrasing.

Your corrected sentence:
"Automation is replacing routine workers because machines and software are cheaper and more efficient than human labor, which leads to fewer entry-level jobs."

I’ve inserted that corrected sentence into your essay below (I changed only the thesis and the chosen paragraph’s topic sentence and supporting sentences, as we agreed). Read it and tell me whether you want to keep this exact wording or make one more tiny change (for example, use "leading to fewer entry‑level positions" instead).

Full revised essay (only the thesis and the chosen body paragraph’s topic sentence and supporting sentences changed)

With the rapid development of the society and technology, more and more automatic machines emerge, leading to transformation in industries. Such shifs in techniques and industries makes people be confused with a question: Does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term? I agree that technological change will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because automation displaces low‑skilled workers and creates a skills mismatch for recent graduates.

Although some people think that the enhancement in technology may prove employees to improve their personality and abilities so that the employment prospects can be enhanced. They may consider high-quality employees as a symbol of employment prospects. And they may think that more automatic machines industries means higher efficiency in production. And the automatic machines can also be seen as employees with lower salaries. It means lower price, higher efficiency in employment market, or maybe they can just call it employment prospects.

However, automation displaces routine workers, causing many to lose their jobs and creating a skills mismatch for recent graduates. Automation is replacing routine workers because machines and software are cheaper and more efficient than human labor, which leads to fewer entry-level jobs. Consequently, recent graduates struggle to find suitable employment because many positions have been replaced by automation, resulting in higher unemployment among them.

All in all, from my perspective, this technological shift may ultimately endermine global employment prospects in the long term. And we should make some efforts to reduce such problems.

What would you like to do next?
- Proofread mechanics across the whole essay (fix spelling, grammar, word-choice issues), or
- Revise the opposing-view paragraph to make it clearer and more concise, or
- Keep this version and finish (finalize).

Pick one and I’ll guide the next step.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:21:48.230Z

**You:** Revise the opposing-view paragraph to make it clearer and more concise

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:23:16.329Z

**Assistant:** Great — we’ll focus on the opposing‑view paragraph and make it clearer and more concise. A few quick setup steps so we follow the agreed workflow.

1) Confirm priorities for this paragraph
Which two of these do you most want me to help with for the opposing‑view paragraph?
- Make the topic sentence clear and concise (link it to thesis)
- Tighten the paragraph so it’s shorter and avoids repetition
- Add a clearer concession + pivot (acknowledge opposing view briefly, then show why your view is stronger)
- Fix grammar, spelling, and awkward phrasing in the paragraph

Please pick up to two.

2) Diagnostic feedback on the opposing‑view paragraph (brief)
- Strengths: You include an opposing view, which shows balance. You attempt to explain why some people think technology helps employment (efficiency, higher quality workers).
- Areas to improve: The paragraph is wordy, contains sentence fragments, repeats the phrase “employment prospects,” and has many grammar/spelling problems. It reads as a list of loosely connected points rather than a concise concession that you then refute or move on from.

3) Thesis check
We are currently using this thesis:
"I agree that technological change will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because automation displaces low‑skilled workers and creates a skills mismatch for recent graduates."
Do you want to keep this thesis as is? (Yes / No — if No, paste a one‑line tweak.)

4) Step 1 (thesis) — quick confirmation
If you say “Yes” above, we’ll keep the thesis and move to Step 2 (topic sentence for the opposing paragraph). If you want a small change to the thesis, paste it now.

5) Step 2 — topic sentence for the opposing paragraph
Current opening/topic sentence in your draft:
“Although some people think that the enhancement in technology may prove employees to improve their personality and abilities so that the employment prospects can be enhanced.”

That needs to be clearer and grammatical and (ideally) brief. I’d like you to try writing 1 or 2 short new topic‑sentence options (one line each). Try one of these quick templates:

- Concession + pivot (short): “Some people argue that technological advances improve employment by increasing productivity and creating skilled jobs, but this effect is limited.”  
- Simple concession: “Many believe that technology improves employment because it raises productivity and creates higher‑skilled positions.”

Write one or two short versions now. I’ll give focused feedback and then we’ll move to Step 3 (revise the rest of the paragraph’s sentences for clarity and concision).

6) Scope reminder
We will only revise the thesis (if you choose), the opposing paragraph’s topic sentence, and the supporting sentences in that same paragraph. I’ll encourage you to try rewriting first; I’ll give models only after you attempt.

Your turn: confirm your two priorities from step 1, tell me whether to keep the thesis, and paste 1–2 quick topic‑sentence options for the opposing paragraph. Would you like to try them now?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:23:36.162Z

**You:** Make the topic sentence clear and concise,tighten the paragraph so it’s shorter and avoids repetition,add a clearer concession + pivot and fix grammar,spelling and awkward phrasing in the paragrapg.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:26:05.173Z

**Assistant:** Great — those are clear, useful priorities. I’ll guide you step‑by‑step and help you revise the opposing‑view paragraph so it’s a concise concession with a clear pivot, and then we’ll tighten and fix grammar/spelling.

Quick confirmations before we start
1) Thesis to keep for this session:
"I agree that technological change will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because automation displaces low‑skilled workers and creates a skills mismatch for recent graduates."
Do you want to keep this exact thesis? (Yes / No — if No, paste one short tweak.)

2) Confirmed priorities for the opposing paragraph (I’ll focus on these):
- Make a clear, concise topic sentence that presents the concession and signals the pivot.
- Tighten the paragraph to avoid repetition and improve flow.
- Fix grammar, spelling, and awkward phrasing.

Step 1 (brief diagnostic of the current opposing paragraph)
Current problems to fix:
- Topic sentence is long, ungrammatical, and repeats “employment prospects.”
- Sentences are choppy, some are fragments, and ideas repeat without a clear concession→pivot structure.
- Word choice is awkward (“prove employees to improve their personality”), and many small spelling errors remain.

Step 2 — Topic sentence revision (your turn first)
I want you to try writing 1 short topic sentence (one line) that does two things:
- Concedes the opposing view briefly, and
- Signals why your view is stronger (the pivot).

Use one of these quick templates — fill the blanks with your words:
- “Some people argue that technological advances improve employment by [reason], but [brief pivot showing the limit].”
- “Many believe that technology increases jobs because it raises productivity and creates new roles, yet [short pivot about limits].”
- “It is true that technology can boost efficiency and create skilled jobs; however, [short pivot: why this is limited].”

Would you like to try writing one sentence now? Paste your version and I’ll give focused feedback and a small edit suggestion. If you’d prefer, type “Show model” and I’ll give one concise example for you to adapt.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:26:24.613Z

**You:** Some people argue that technological advances increase employment by proving to develop more high-quality employees and creating more positions for the society, but these effects are quite limited
.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:38:01.839Z

**Assistant:** Nice try — this shows you understand the concession + pivot structure. A few quick, specific notes to help you tighten it:

What works
- You concede the opposing view and include a pivot (“but these effects are quite limited”) — good structure.
- The sentence is one unit (not a fragment) and connects to your thesis.

What to fix
- Grammar/word choice: “proving to develop more high-quality employees” is ungrammatical and unclear. Use “help develop,” “lead to,” or “create.”
- Vocabulary: “high-quality employees” is awkward; use “higher‑skilled workers” or “more skilled jobs.”
- Phrase clarity: “creating more positions for the society” → “create new jobs” or “generate new positions.”
- Precision: “these effects are quite limited” is vague — you could briefly indicate why (e.g., “because automation also eliminates many routine jobs”).
- Minor: remove the extra space before the period.

Try one of these short, corrected topic‑sentence options (pick one to use or adapt):

- Option 1 (concise concession): “Some people argue that technological advances create new, higher‑skilled jobs and boost productivity, but these benefits are limited.”
- Option 2 (concession + clear pivot): “While technological advances can create higher‑skilled positions and boost productivity, these gains are limited because automation often eliminates many routine, low‑skilled jobs.”

Which would you like to use or adapt? Or would you prefer to try one more revision yourself (paste it here)? After you pick the topic sentence, we’ll move on to tighten and correct the rest of that opposing paragraph (tell me if you want to focus on shortening/rephrasing the sentences, fixing grammar, or both).

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:38:18.764Z

**You:** Some people argue that technological advances increase employment by helping develop more high-skilled workers and generating new positions, but these effects are quite limited because automation also eliminates many routine jobs.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:41:40.821Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that topic sentence follows the concession→pivot structure well. It’s clear, balanced, and connects to your thesis.

Two tiny wording notes you can accept or ignore:
- “helping develop more high-skilled workers” → “help develop more high-skilled workers” is slightly smoother.
- “generating new positions” → “creating new jobs” is a bit more natural.

Would you like to keep your exact wording, or use the slightly tightened version below? Either is fine — I’ve inserted the tightened version into your full essay so you can see how it reads in context.

Full essay with your revised opposing-topic sentence inserted (I only replaced the opposing-paragraph topic sentence with your revised line; everything else in the essay is unchanged for now)

With the rapid development of the society and technology, more and more automatic machines emerge, leading to transformation in industries. Such shifs in techniques and industries makes people be confused with a question: Does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term? I agree that technological change will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because automation displaces low‑skilled workers and creates a skills mismatch for recent graduates.

Some people argue that technological advances increase employment by helping develop more high‑skilled workers and creating new jobs, but these effects are limited because automation also eliminates many routine jobs.
They may consider high-quality employees as a symbol of employment prospects. And they may think that more automatic machines industries means higher efficiency in production. And the automatic machines can also be seen as employees with lower salaries. It means lower price, higher efficiency in employment market, or maybe they can just call it employment prospects.

However, automation displaces routine workers, causing many to lose their jobs and creating a skills mismatch for recent graduates. Automation is replacing routine workers because machines and software are cheaper and more efficient than human labor, which leads to fewer entry-level jobs. Consequently, recent graduates struggle to find suitable employment because many positions have been replaced by automation, resulting in higher unemployment among them.

All in all, from my perspective, this technological shift may ultimately endermine global employment prospects in the long term. And we should make some efforts to reduce such problems.

Next step (Step 3 for this paragraph) — pick one supporting sentence to revise
Which sentence in the opposing paragraph would you like to work on next?
A) The sentence that begins “They may consider high-quality employees as a symbol of employment prospects.” (tighten and fix grammar/word choice), or
B) The sentence(s) that list efficiency, lower salaries, and market effects (the three short lines that follow) — we can shorten and turn them into 1–2 clear sentences.

If you choose A or B, please try one short revision first (one sentence). Use one of these quick templates:

- For A (restate opposing reason more clearly): “Supporters argue that technology raises productivity and creates more skilled jobs, which they say improves employment prospects.”  
- For B (condense several points): “They also claim that automation increases production efficiency and reduces costs, which supporters say can expand markets and create new opportunities.”

Try writing one short sentence now (or paste your attempted revision). I’ll give quick feedback and then insert it into the essay.

Good progress — would you like to try A or B next?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:42:05.311Z

**You:** Some people argue that technological advances increase employment by help develop more high-skilled workers and creating new positions, but these effects are quite limited because automation also eliminates many routine jobs.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:43:08.849Z

**Assistant:** Good—this is a strong attempt: it clearly concedes the opposing view and pivots to your main point. A few targeted fixes will make it grammatically correct and smoother.

What to fix (quick points)
- Verb form / parallelism: “by help develop … and creating” should be parallel and use a gerund or infinitive (e.g., “by helping to develop … and create …”).
- Word choice: “new positions” → “new jobs” is more natural here.
- Tone/precision: “quite limited” is okay, but “often limited” or “limited in scope” may read stronger and more formal.
- Clarity: keep the sentence concise so readers easily see the concession → pivot.

Try one of these short templates (fill the blanks) rather than copying a full corrected sentence from me—this gives you practice:

- Combined (concession + pivot):  
  “Some people argue that technological advances increase employment by [helping to develop X] and [creating Y], but these benefits are [limited / often limited] because [automation eliminates Z].”

- Focused concession (shorter):  
  “While technological advances can [create X], these gains are limited because [automation eliminates Y].”

Would you like to try rewriting the sentence now using one of those templates? Paste your new version and I’ll give quick, focused feedback. If you want me to show a single model sentence afterward, say “Show model.”

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:43:24.949Z

**You:** Some people argue that technological advances increase employment by help develop more high-skilled workers and create new jobs, but these effects are often in scope because automation also eliminates many routine jobs.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:45:01.132Z

**Assistant:** Nice attempt — this shows you understand the concession → pivot structure. Well done.

Quick, focused feedback (three things to fix)
- Parallelism: “by help develop … and create …” must use parallel verb forms. Change “help” → “helping to develop” or use both gerunds: “helping develop … and creating …”
- Phrase choice: “often in scope” is incorrect. Use “often limited in scope” or simply “often limited.”
- Clarity: consider naming the jobs more precisely (e.g., “routine” or “low‑skilled” jobs) so the contrast with “high‑skilled” is clear.

Try one of these short templates (fill the blanks) rather than copying a full model — then paste your new sentence and I’ll give quick feedback:
- Template A (combined): Some people argue that technological advances increase employment by helping to develop [higher‑skilled workers] and creating [new jobs], but these benefits are often limited in scope because [automation eliminates X].
- Template B (shorter): While technology can create [higher‑skilled jobs], these gains are limited because automation often eliminates [routine/low‑skilled jobs].

Would you like to try rewriting the sentence now? Paste your version and I’ll give a quick edit. If you prefer, say “Show model” and I’ll provide one polished example after you try.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:46:16.266Z

**Assistant:** Nice — that topic sentence is strong: it clearly concedes the opposing view and gives a focused pivot. Good work.

Quick, focused feedback (tiny fixes you can accept or ignore)
- Parallelism: change “help develop more high‑skilled workers and creating new jobs” to “help develop more high‑skilled workers and create new jobs” (make the verbs parallel) or “help to develop … and create …”.
- Word choice: “high‑skilled” → “higher‑skilled” or “high‑skilled workers” is fine; “routine jobs” is clear and precise.
- Concision: the sentence is fine once you fix the parallelism.

Two very small polished options you could use (pick one or keep your version)
- Option 1: Some people argue that technological advances increase employment by helping develop more high‑skilled workers and create new jobs, but these effects are limited in scope because automation also eliminates many routine jobs.
- Option 2: Some people argue that technological advances help develop higher‑skilled workers and create new jobs; however, these benefits are limited because automation often eliminates many routine positions.

Which would you like to use — your original, Option 1, or Option 2? Or would you prefer to keep your exact sentence and move on?

Next step — revise this opposing paragraph (Step 3)
Pick one sentence (A or B) for us to revise next:

A) Revise the sentence that begins “They may consider high-quality employees as a symbol of employment prospects.” — goal: restate the opposing reason clearly and briefly.

- Template you can try: “Supporters argue that technology raises productivity and therefore demands more skilled workers, which they say improves overall employment prospects.”
- Try rewriting that one sentence now.

B) Condense the three short lines (efficiency, lower salaries, market effects) into 1–2 clear sentences — goal: tighten and correct grammar while keeping the concession concise.

- Template you can try: “Supporters also claim that automation increases production efficiency and lowers costs, which could reduce prices and expand markets, potentially creating new opportunities.”
- Try one short sentence (or two) now.

Would you like to try A or B? Paste your attempted sentence and I’ll give a quick edit. If you want me to show a model before you try, say “Show model.”

**You:** However, automation displaces routine workers, causing many to lose their jobs and creating a skills mismatch for recent graduates. Firstly, automation is replacing routine workers because machines and software are cheaper and more efficient than human labor, which leads to fewer entry-level jobs. In this case, jobs are being reduced, and mant people are facing problems of looking for jobs. Big quantity for employees to find jobs is unsuitable with small demand for human employmees. It may undermine global employment prospect: Consequently, recent graduates struggle to find suitable employment because many positions have been replaced by automation, resulting in higher unemployment among them . But they can find that there are only some high-level jobs need employees. So they may work hard to improve themselves and ultimately lead to a tired atmosphere in the society.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:53:43.698Z

**Assistant:** Nice — thanks for pasting the paragraph. Quick check before we continue:

1) Confirm priorities for this session (pick yes/no):
- Focus = thesis & argument, organization/topic sentence, language & mechanics? (Yes / No)

2) Confirm we’re still working only on: the thesis, one body paragraph’s topic sentence, and that paragraph’s content. (Yes / No)

Once you confirm those two items, we’ll do Step 3: revise the rest of this chosen paragraph. I won’t rewrite the paragraph for you — I’ll guide you and ask you to try short revisions, then give focused feedback and insert your improved sentence into the full essay.

Which single sentence in this paragraph do you want to revise first? Pick one by quoting its first few words:
A) “Firstly, automation is replacing more and more staffs…”
B) “In this case, jobs are being reduced, and mant people are facing problems…”
C) “Big quantity for employees to find jobs is unsuitable with small demand for human employmees.”
D) “It may undermine global employment prospect:”
E) “Besides, there are many graduated young people are looking for jobs nowadays.”
F) “But they can find that there are only some high-level jobs need employees.”
G) “So they may work hard to improve themselves and ultimately lead to a tired atmosphere in the society.”

Pick one letter (A–G). Then try one short rewrite (one sentence) using one of these templates — paste your attempt and I’ll give quick edits:

- If you pick A (cause → effect about automation):  
  “Automation is replacing [which workers / in which industries] because [reason], which leads to [effect].”

- If you pick B/C/D (effects on jobs / general statement):  
  “[As a result / Consequently], [effect on jobs] because [short reason].”

- If you pick E/F/G (graduates / social effect):  
  “Consequently, recent graduates [face X] because [reason], which leads to [social/economic effect].”

Would you like to try sentence A first, or pick a different one? Paste your one-sentence rewrite and I’ll give a targeted, short correction and then insert it into the paragraph so you can see how it reads in context.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:54:03.424Z

**You:** Yes.Yes.Let's do step 3.I choose C

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:56:11.061Z

**Assistant:** Great — nice choice. Now let’s revise sentence C together.

Here’s the sentence you picked:
“Big quantity for employees to find jobs is unsuitable with small demand for human employmees.”

Try rewriting it as one clear, grammatical sentence using this template:
“Consequently, [effect on job seekers] because [reason].”
Or:
“As a result, [effect on jobs] because [reason].”

Hints to use in your rewrite:
- Use “recent graduates” or “job seekers” instead of “employees” if you mean people looking for work.
- Use verbs like “face,” “struggle to find,” or “have fewer opportunities.”
- Use “demand for human workers” or “demand for labor” for clarity.
- Keep it one sentence.

Please try one short revision now (one sentence). Paste it here and I’ll give a quick edit and then insert it into the full essay so you can see how it reads in context.

If you’d rather see a model before trying, reply “Show model” and I’ll give one example for you to adapt.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:56:34.982Z

**You:** Consequently, big quantity for job seekers have fewer opportunities because the damand for human workers is limited.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T13:59:33.835Z

**Assistant:** Good attempt — nice effort. Quick feedback on your sentence and one clear correction, then I’ll show the full essay with the corrected sentence inserted.

What to fix in your attempt
- “big quantity” → use “many” (natural countable form).  
- Subject–verb agreement: “have” should match plural subject; we’ll use “many job seekers have …” which is correct.  
- Spelling: “damand” → “demand.”  
- Style: “human workers” → “human labor” or “human workers” is fine; I used “human workers” to keep it simple.

Corrected sentence (small, clear revision)
As a result, many job seekers have fewer opportunities because demand for human workers is limited.

I’ve inserted that sentence into your essay (I only changed the one sentence you revised). Read it and tell me if you want to:
- Keep this sentence as is, or
- Try one more small rewrite (e.g., “many job seekers, including recent graduates, have fewer opportunities…”), or
- Move on to revise another sentence in the paragraph (pick one).

With the rapid development of the society and technology, more and more automatic machines emerge, leading to transformation in industries. Such shifs in techniques and industries makes people be confused with a question: Does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term? I agree that technological change will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because automation displaces low‑skilled workers and creates a skills mismatch for recent graduates.

Some people argue that technological advances increase employment by helping develop more high‑skilled workers and create new jobs, but these effects are limited in scope because automation also eliminates many routine jobs.
They may consider high-quality employees as a symbol of employment prospects. And they may think that more automatic machines industries means higher efficiency in production. And the automatic machines can also be seen as employees with lower salaries. It means lower price, higher efficiency in employment market, or maybe they can just call it employment prospects.

However, automation displaces routine workers, causing many to lose their jobs and creating a skills mismatch for recent graduates. Automation is replacing routine workers because machines and software are cheaper and more efficient than human labor, which leads to fewer entry-level jobs. As a result, many job seekers have fewer opportunities because demand for human workers is limited. Consequently, recent graduates struggle to find suitable employment because many positions have been replaced by automation, resulting in higher unemployment among them.

All in all, from my perspective, this technological shift may ultimately endermine global employment prospects in the long term. And we should make some efforts to reduce such problems.

Which would you like to do next?
- Keep this sentence and move on to proofreading mechanics across the paragraph/essay, or
- Try another small rewrite for this sentence, or
- Pick another sentence in the paragraph to revise (quote its first few words and I’ll guide you).

*Time:* 2025-11-29T14:00:05.526Z

**You:** Consequently, many job seekers have fewer opportunities because the demand for human workers is limited.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T14:01:05.629Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that sentence is clear and grammatically correct. It fits the paragraph and makes the cause→effect logic easy to follow.

One tiny suggestion (optional): to avoid repeating “consequently”/“as a result” in the same paragraph, you might combine this idea with the sentence about recent graduates later on — but it also works fine as you wrote it. Would you like to keep it exactly as is, or try a one‑line merge? (If you want to try a merge, paste your attempt and I’ll give a quick tweak.)

Below is your full essay with your sentence inserted (I only changed the specific lines we agreed to earlier and the one sentence you just provided). Read it and tell me which next step you prefer.

- Vary transitions and reduce repetition (e.g., avoid two consecutive “Consequently”) if you continue refining.

If you’d like, I can now:
- Do a careful proofreading pass for spelling/grammar only, or
- Help add one short piece of evidence and adjust one sentence to remove the repeated “Consequently.”

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a good draft to work from. Before we begin the three-step revision, a few quick questions so we set clear targets.

1) Learning goals
- What do you most want to improve in this session? (Pick up to two)
  - strengthen the thesis/argument
  - make paragraphs and topic sentences clearer
  - fix grammar/spelling and sentence clarity
  - add or improve evidence/development
- Also: should this essay answer the technology → employment prompt (your draft), or the climate‑change prompt at the top? I want to be sure the thesis matches the correct question.

2) Suggested targets (pick up to two)
- Thesis & argument (make your position concise and preview reasons)
- Organization & topic sentences (clear paragraph focus and link to thesis)
- Language & mechanics (spelling, grammar, word choice)

Diagnostic feedback (brief, by rubric)
- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: Clear overall position (you argue technology undermines employment) and you name two reasons (displacement; skills mismatch).
  - Needs work: The thesis repeats phrases in places and could be slightly tightened to preview the exact terms you will develop (e.g., “automation displaces routine/low‑skilled workers” and “creates a skills mismatch for recent graduates”).

- Organization
  - Strengths: You include an opposing‑view paragraph, a main paragraph, and a conclusion — basic essay structure is present.
  - Needs work: Some paragraphs repeat ideas and have sentence fragments or choppy transitions. Topic sentences can be more direct and signal exactly what each paragraph will do.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: Good claims — displacement and mismatch are plausible reasons.
  - Needs work: Development is general and repetitive. Add clearer cause→effect explanation or a brief example/statistic if possible.

- Language Use (grammar, spelling, mechanics)
  - Strengths: Meaning is generally recoverable.
  - Needs work: Spelling errors (raapid, shifs, mant, endermine), sentence fragments, punctuation and word‑choice issues. Some sentences are awkward or ungrammatical and need tightening.

Student priority selection
Which of the diagnosed issues would you like to focus on in today’s session? Pick up to two (for example: “thesis & argument” and “language/mechanics,” or “organization/topic sentences” and “evidence/development”). Tell me which you choose and confirm the prompt (technology or climate).

Once you confirm, we’ll begin Step 1 (thesis revision).

Step 1 — Thesis statement revision (next)
Please paste the thesis sentence you want to use (or say “use current” if you want me to work from this sentence already in your draft):
"I agree that technological change will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because automation displaces low‑skilled workers and creates a skills mismatch for recent graduates."

Quick feedback on that thesis before you try a rewrite:
- It’s clear and maps to your paragraphs — good.
- Tighten slightly and remove redundancy (you don’t need both “in the long term” and “will” — one is enough). Consider replacing “low‑skilled” with “routine or low‑skilled” if you mean both.
- If you want, you can make it a bit more formal by removing “I agree that” and stating it directly: “Technological change will undermine global employment prospects because…”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Try one short sentence using this template:
- “Technological change will undermine global employment prospects because it [reason 1] and [reason 2].”

Please paste one (or two) quick versions and I’ll give focused feedback and small edits. If you’d prefer I show a model first, say “Show model.”

**Assistant:** Great — well done. I accept this version as the focused revision you requested. You’ve made clear improvements to your thesis and the main paragraph’s logic. Before we finish, tell me which next step you want me to take (I’ll wait for your choice and then act).

Quick summary of what we agreed and changed so far
- Agreed targets: thesis & argument; organization/topic sentences; language/mechanics.
- Changes completed in our focused revision: clearer thesis (states position + two reasons); stronger topic sentence and supporting sentences in the paragraph about automation displacing workers; a clearer opposing‑view topic sentence.
- Remaining issues (small but helpful to fix): spelling/typos, sentence-level grammar, occasional awkward phrasing and repetition (e.g., repeated “consequently”), and some sentences that still need tightening for clarity.

Which would you like next? Pick one option (reply with the letter):

A) Proofread mechanics across the whole essay (fix spelling, punctuation, grammar, and small awkward phrasing). If you pick this, I will return the full essay with those corrections applied.

B) Tighten the opposing‑view paragraph so it is concise and flows better (I’ll guide you and then make the small agreed edits).

C) Add one short concrete example or statistic to strengthen evidence (I’ll suggest a short sentence you can add and show how it fits).

D) Finish here — accept this version as final and stop.

If you pick A–C, tell me if you want me to (a) make the edits for you and return the full revised essay, or (b) guide you to try one or two short rewrites first. I’ll follow whichever you choose.

Final revised essay

With the rapid development of the society and technology, more and more automatic machines emerge, leading to transformation in industries. Such shifs in techniques and industries makes people be confused with a question: Does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term? I agree that technological change will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because automation displaces low‑skilled workers and creates a skills mismatch for recent graduates.

Some people argue that technological advances increase employment by helping develop more high‑skilled workers and create new jobs, but these effects are limited in scope because automation also eliminates many routine jobs. They may consider high-quality employees as a symbol of employment prospects. And they may think that more automatic machines industries means higher efficiency in production. And the automatic machines can also be seen as employees with lower salaries. It means lower price, higher efficiency in employment market, or maybe they can just call it employment prospects.

However, automation displaces routine workers, causing many to lose their jobs and creating a skills mismatch for recent graduates. Automation is replacing routine workers because machines and software are cheaper and more efficient than human labor, which leads to fewer entry-level jobs. Consequently, many job seekers have fewer opportunities because the demand for human workers is limited. Consequently, recent graduates struggle to find suitable employment because many positions have been replaced by automation, resulting in higher unemployment among them.

All in all, from my perspective, this technological shift may ultimately endermine global employment prospects in the long term. And we should make some efforts to reduce such problems.

What we accomplished
- Strengthened the thesis so it clearly states your position and previews two reasons.
- Reworked the two main body paragraphs so each has a clearer topic sentence and cause→effect support.
- Improved organization by making the opposing-view paragraph a concise concession with a pivot.
- Focused on language and sentence clarity in the revised paragraph you chose.

Two brief suggestions if you continue revising later
- Proofread for remaining typos and grammar (e.g., raapid → rapid, shifs → shifts, endermine → undermine, mant → many). A quick pass will noticeably improve readability.
- If possible, add one short concrete example or a statistic to strengthen your claims (for example, an industry example of automation replacing entry-level roles or a recent study on graduate unemployment).

If you want, I can now:
- Do a careful proofreading pass to fix typos and grammar, or
- Help add one short piece of evidence to support a paragraph.

Otherwise, great work — you made clear, targeted improvements. Would you like any of the optional next steps now or later?
