            ## Contribution Analysis

            You’ve made good progress so far! Since you confirmed the formal alternatives are helpful, if you’d like, we can practice now with one sentence revision together.

Here’s a suggestion for revising this sentence from your paragraph:  
> *In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions.*

Using the formal alternative:  
> *In some countries, citizens have collectively advocated for the adoption of new regulations on plastic use and carbon emission reductions.*

Would you like to try rewriting that sentence (or another one) yourself now, using the formal language suggestions?  
If you prefer, I can also provide a fully revised version of the entire paragraph based on the formal alternatives and improvements we discussed. Just let me know how you want to proceed!

            ---

            ## 🟤 Grading Result *(Hidden from Students)*

            Not finished.

The student has successfully:
- Revised the thesis statement (with the AI, producing a clearer and more academic thesis).
- Revised one of the topic sentences (the body paragraph’s topic sentence about influencing government).

However, although the student received feedback and formal alternatives from the AI for the body paragraph, they have not yet produced a full revision of the body paragraph itself—only an intention to revise, with collaborative requests for language suggestions. The student has not submitted or confirmed a revised body paragraph. Therefore, the three outlined tasks are not all complete.

## Human-AI Collaboration Analysis (Progress Emphasis)

### AI Collaboration Performance

#### Evidence of Effective Collaboration
- The student actively identified and located key essay features (thesis and topic sentence) when prompted by the AI.
- Demonstrated willingness to revise, ask for model sentences, and accept constructive feedback.
- Requested and incorporated precise academic language alternatives suggested by the AI.

#### Strengths Demonstrated
1. **Openness to Feedback:** Responds quickly to feedback and requests alternatives, e.g., “provide a model sentence” and “these suggestions are good.”
2. **Strategic Use of AI:** Asks specifically for underlined informal expressions and formal alternatives, indicating targeted use of the AI for language improvement.
3. **Incremental Revision:** Willing to improve step-by-step—thesis, topic sentence, then body paragraph expressions.

#### Areas for Ongoing Improvement
1. **Completing Full Revision Cycles:** The student should now synthesize the feedback and full-sentence suggestions to produce and submit a fully revised body paragraph, not just accept alternatives at the phrase level.
2. **Iteration/Reflection:** Greater engagement in the self-editing cycle by revising and then seeking further critique would strengthen both writing and collaboration skills.

---

### Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Produce Full Paragraph Revision:** Using the formal alternatives suggested, the student should now revise and submit the entire body paragraph, ensuring logical flow, unity, and academic style throughout.
2. **Seek Further AI Feedback after Revising:** After submitting the full revision, engage in one more round of feedback with the AI to refine content, organization, and sentence structure.
3. **Reflect on the Revision Process:** The student may articulate what has changed, why, and how AI assistance contributed—developing self-awareness as a learner and collaborator.

## AI Collaboration Skills Assessment (Progress Emphasis)
| Area                | Status/Quality | Comments                 |
|---------------------|:--------------:|--------------------------|
| Context Provision   |   Good         | Student provides clear targets for revision, but more explicit links to course aims and rubric could further strengthen collaboration. |
| Strategic Planning  |   Good         | Strategic in asking for models and targeting problem language. More planning ahead for paragraph development would help. |
| Critical Evaluation |   Good         | Accepts feedback directly—could offer more critical reasoning for adapting or rejecting suggestions. |
| Independent Editing | Needs Improvement| Hasn’t yet submitted a synthesized, fully revised body paragraph independently using the suggestions provided.           |

---

### Summary

**Overall, the student is demonstrating a positive, receptive attitude toward AI-assisted revision, making good progress in thesis and topic sentence revision, and showing developing strategic and reflective skills. To complete the revision cycle, the student should now synthesize the language feedback into a fully revised body paragraph, submit it, and seek a final round of improvement from the AI.**

---

### Instructor Notes

- Encourage the student to complete the full paragraph revision before final assessment.
- Commend the student's openness and willingness to request and implement specific feedback.
- Consider offering prompts to encourage deeper critical reflection and more independent editing decisions in future cycles.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. While large-scale action from governments and companies is crucial, individual efforts are also significant because citizens can influence environmental policies and collective lifestyle choices can push industries toward sustainable change.

Collective citizen action plays a significant role in shaping government environmental policies and encouraging meaningful climate initiatives. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. However, government response to citizen demands can be limited, and meaningful policy changes do not always occur. Additionally, a lack of effective communication channels between citizens and policymakers can result in stagnation.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit.  Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:31:29.211Z

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:05:57.237Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:07:20.223Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s start with **Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision.**

### Your Current Thesis Statement:
> I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

#### Feedback:
- **Clarity**: The main point is present, but the thesis is a little long and could be more direct.
- **Strength & Focus**: “I partly agree”—can we state your opinion with more confidence and avoid vague language like “I also think”?
- **Previewing Structure**: Good job previewing both citizens’ influence on the government and personal green choices, but you can give a clearer preview of the two main points.
- **Academic Tone**: Phrases like “I partly agree” and “I also think” can be replaced with more precise academic language.

---

#### Your thesis should:
- *Clearly answer*: Do individual actions matter compared to governments/companies?
- *Preview*: Mention influencing government and personal green actions.
- *Use confident, precise language*.

---

**Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement now? If you want, you can write your revised version, and I’ll give feedback and help you improve it!**

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:07:24.431Z

**You:** Although individual action may appear to be insignificant compared to that of the governments' and industries', I assert that individual action is indispensable because individual voices shape government policies and individual choices of green life style impact the industry.

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:12:16.959Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for your revised thesis statement! Here’s some feedback to help you refine it further:

**Positive Points:**
- You use more confident language with “I assert.”
- You clearly preview that individual voices shape government policy and choices impact industry.
- Good use of academic vocabulary (e.g., “indispensable”).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Clarity:** Try to make the sentence a bit simpler and remove repetition (e.g., “individual action” and “individual voices/choices”).
2. **Grammar:** “governments’ and industries’” should be “governments and industries” for clarity.
3. **Conciseness:** The thesis can be shortened for more direct impact.

**Possible Questions to Consider:**
- Do you want to emphasize that individual action has two main effects: influencing policies and affecting industries?  
- Is your position that individual actions matter *alongside* government and company actions?

---

**Would you like to try a new revision based on this feedback?  
Focus on: confident tone, clear structure (two main ways individuals matter), and concise wording.**

Let me know when you’re ready, or ask for an example if you’d like a model sentence (but you can try first!).

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:12:21.728Z

**You:** provide a model sentence

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:13:39.962Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely—here’s a model thesis statement based on your essay’s focus and my feedback:

Model Thesis Statement:  
While large-scale action from governments and companies is crucial, individual efforts are also significant because citizens can influence environmental policies and collective lifestyle choices can push industries toward sustainable change.

---

You can adapt this model to fit your own style! Would you like to try adjusting it, or are you happy with this direction?

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:13:42.579Z

**You:** Happy with this.

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:14:29.832Z

**Assistant:** Great! You’ve confirmed you’re happy with this thesis statement, so your revised version is:

> While large-scale action from governments and companies is crucial, individual efforts are also significant because citizens can influence environmental policies and collective lifestyle choices can push industries toward sustainable change.

**Next: Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision**

Please choose **one body paragraph** (either the paragraph about influencing government or the paragraph about everyday lifestyle choices) that you want to revise further.

- Which paragraph would you like to work on for revising its topic sentence?  
  *(For example, the first body paragraph about citizens influencing government, or the second body paragraph about personal green choices?)*

Let me know your choice, then please copy and paste the current topic sentence for that paragraph. We’ll review, adjust the topic sentence to connect strongly to your thesis, and then move on to the rest of the paragraph!

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:14:32.704Z

**You:** It's go with first body paragraph - The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:17:51.886Z

**Assistant:** Great choice! Let's focus on the **first body paragraph** about individuals influencing government.

### Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision

#### Your current topic sentence:
> The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

#### Feedback:
- **Connection to Thesis:** Your thesis says that citizens can influence environmental policies, and this topic sentence reflects that idea.
- **Clarity:** “The most important way” is a strong phrase, but since your thesis presents both influencing government and personal choices as valuable, consider if you want to rank one over the other, or just emphasize its significance.
- **Academic Tone:** “Influencing the government and politicians” is direct, but you could make the phrasing a bit more academic—“policy change” or “environmental decisions.”
- **Preview:** Is it clear you’re going to discuss how citizens’ actions affect government decision-making?

---

#### Guiding Questions:
- Do you want to state this is the “most important” way, or just an “important” way?
- Can you restate the idea using some language from your thesis, e.g., “influencing environmental policies”?
- Try to clearly indicate in the topic sentence what this paragraph will develop (how individuals impact government action on climate).

---

**Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now?**  
*Remember: aim for a strong link to your thesis and a confident, clear tone.*

Type your revision when you’re ready!

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:17:56.931Z

**You:** One important way individuals can influence the government is by shaping environmental policies.

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:21:26.140Z

**Assistant:** Very nice start! Here’s some encouraging, constructive feedback on your revised topic sentence:

**Positive Points:**
- Good use of academic language: “shaping environmental policies.”
- Stronger, clearer than before—directly states the paragraph’s main idea.
- Maintains a confident and precise tone.

**Suggestions for Further Improvement:**
1. **Clarity and Context:** You could specify that this influence is through collective citizen action, which links more directly to the thesis and sets up the supporting examples (like protests, voting, public pressure).
2. **Connection to Thesis:** Consider mentioning that this action is “significant” or “powerful” (if you want to signal its importance alongside personal choices).

**Guiding Questions:**
- Do you want to emphasize that individuals do this through actions like voting, protesting, or public advocacy?
- Would you like to add words like “significant” or “powerful” to make the topic sentence even stronger?

---

**Would you like to try further revising your topic sentence based on these points?**  
You can also keep your version if you feel it already fits your intent—just let me know if you’re satisfied, or if you want to try another revision!

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:21:30.946Z

**You:** please provide a modal

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:22:37.108Z

**Assistant:** Of course! Here's a **model topic sentence** you can use or adapt for your paragraph about individuals influencing government on climate change:

**Model Topic Sentence:**  
Collective citizen action plays a significant role in shaping government environmental policies and encouraging meaningful climate initiatives.

---

You can adjust this sentence to better fit your style or the specific examples you include in your paragraph.  
Would you like to try editing it, or do you want to use this version? Just let me know how you'd like to proceed!

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:22:40.151Z

**You:** It's good. Let's work on the rest of body paragraph 1.

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:23:53.501Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! Now, let’s move to **Step 3: Revising the Rest of Body Paragraph 1**.

Here’s your **current body paragraph 1**:

> When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

---

**Let’s revise this paragraph so that it clearly supports your topic sentence, flows logically, and uses clear academic language.**

Here are some guiding questions and suggestions:

1. **Unity and Focus:**
   - Do all your supporting details directly show *how* citizen action influences government policies?
   - Are there any sentences that could be combined for clarity or removed if they repeat an idea?

2. **Clarity and Coherence:**
   - Can the examples—protests, voting, new rules—be introduced with more explanation, so the reader understands their connection to the main idea?
   - When discussing limitations (when governments don’t listen), can you clearly explain why this happens?

3. **Evidence and Explanation:**
   - Is there a specific example or case study you can mention (even briefly) to strengthen the point about citizens leading to policy change? Or, if you prefer, can you generalize clearly?

4. **Vocabulary and Sentence Structure:**
   - Are there areas where you can use more precise academic vocabulary? For example, “pressure from normal people” could become “public pressure” or “citizen advocacy.”
   - Watch for sentence structure—can any of the sentences be made more complex or varied?

---

**Would you like to try revising one or two sentences now?**  
For example, you could choose a sentence that feels unclear or repetitive and rewrite it for clarity.  
Or, if you want, pick a part of the paragraph that you think needs improvement and share a revised version.  
I’ll give feedback and we’ll continue refining together!

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:24:00.251Z

**You:** I think the part that need the most revision is the formality of language, and sentence structure. Can you underline all informal expressions in this paragraph and provide a formal alternative?

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:26:44.167Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely, that’s a great way to target revision! I’ll **underline informal or non-academic expressions** in your paragraph and provide a more formal alternative for each. Remember: I won’t rewrite full sentences—just offer substitutions you can use in your own revision.

---

**Original Paragraph with Underlined Informal Expressions:**

> When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people **protest** or **vote for leaders who care about the environment**, it can **push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy**. In some countries, people have **joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions**. This shows that **public opinion and pressure from normal people** can have a **big effect**, even if individuals alone do not have much power. **But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.**

---

### Formal Alternatives for Underlined Expressions:

1. **protest**  
   → *organize demonstrations*

2. **vote for leaders who care about the environment**  
   → *vote for environmentally-conscious representatives*

3. **push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy**  
   → *motivate the government to implement stricter pollution controls or invest in renewable energy initiatives*

4. **joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions**  
   → *collectively advocated for the adoption of new regulations on plastic use and carbon emission reductions*

5. **public opinion and pressure from normal people**  
   → *public advocacy and citizen engagement*

6. **big effect**  
   → *significant impact*

7. **But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well.**  
   → *However, government response to citizen demands can be limited, and meaningful policy changes do not always occur.*

8. **Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.**  
   → *Additionally, a lack of effective communication channels between citizens and policymakers can result in stagnation.*

---

You can now use these formal alternatives to revise your own sentences!  
**Would you like to try rewriting any sentence with these suggestions?**  
If you’re unsure, pick one sentence and give it a try—I’ll review and help you refine it further.

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:26:51.682Z

**You:** These suggestions are good. Thank you.

*Time:* 2025-11-10T15:31:11.178Z

**Assistant:** You’re very welcome—great work so far! Let’s keep improving your paragraph step by step.

Would you like to choose one sentence from your paragraph to revise using the formal alternatives I gave?  
For example, you might start with this sentence:

- Original: "In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions."

Try revising it using: *collectively advocated for the adoption of new regulations on plastic use and carbon emission reductions.*

Or, you can pick a different sentence that you feel needs improvement.

**Would you like to try rewriting one sentence now?**  
Share your revision, and I’ll give you feedback and suggestions to make it even stronger!
