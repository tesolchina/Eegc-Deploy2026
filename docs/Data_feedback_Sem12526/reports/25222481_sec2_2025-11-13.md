            ## Contribution Analysis

            I see that you have been engaging with the revision process but keep deferring actual rewriting with “let’s pretend” or similar phrases. To make real progress, I suggest we take it one concrete step at a time, writing actual sentences together.

Since you want to move on, let's focus now on revising one **supporting sentence** from the paragraph about individual green lifestyle choices.

Here is a sentence from your draft that would benefit from clearer academic phrasing:

> “But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem.”

Could you try rewriting this sentence in a clearer, more formal way? For example, you might say something like:

*“However, a significant barrier to widespread adoption of sustainable habits is that many individuals prefer convenience over environmental concerns, which limits the overall impact.”*

If you’d like, I can help you craft this sentence step by step.

Please write your revision of that sentence here. Once you share it, I will provide feedback and we can revise the other sentences similarly. This way, we produce actual drafts rather than “pretending” — fulfilling your training goals.

Looking forward to your concrete revision!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

---

### STUDENT TRAINING PROGRESS STATUS

#### Task Completion Checklist
- **Revised Thesis Statement:** NOT CLEARLY COMPLETED (Student repeatedly asked to imagine or "pretend" the statement was revised, but no actual revised, confident thesis statement was submitted or reviewed.)
- **Revised ONE Topic Sentence:** NOT CLEARLY COMPLETED (Student did not provide a clear revised topic sentence after feedback—the process remained at the "let's pretend and move on" stage.)
- **Revised ONE Body Paragraph:** NOT COMPLETED (Student did not submit revised supporting sentences or a revised body paragraph—conversation focused on process, not product.)

**Progress Status:**  
> not finished

---

### AI COLLABORATION & ENGAGEMENT FEEDBACK

#### Collaboration Quality
- The student demonstrated willingness to participate in the revision cycle but showed reluctance to carry out the actual revision tasks, instead repeatedly suggesting to "pretend" revisions were completed ("let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on bla bla bla").
- Multiple invitations and scaffolding from the AI assistant to perform genuine revision steps were declined or bypassed.
- As a result, concrete evidence of revision and applied learning is lacking in both essay product and collaboration cycle.

#### Observed Interaction Patterns
- Student engaged in over 10 conversational exchanges with the AI, but did not move past the instruction and planning phases.
- Student did not actively evaluate, challenge, or reflect on AI feedback—instead, responses defaulted to bypassing revision steps.
- No critical review of AI suggestions or meaningful iteration was observable across the session.

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated
- Engagement with the AI assistant in dialogue was sustained (multiple exchanges), indicating basic willingness to use the tool.
- Student identified the thesis statement and main essay points, demonstrating awareness of essay structure.

#### Areas for Improvement
- **Task Execution:** Student must transform feedback and revision planning into actual, written drafts in each step—this is essential for measured progress.
- **Critical Engagement:** Student should actively respond to AI suggestions with effortful writing and reflection, rather than bypassing the process.
- **Productive Collaboration:** The session should show genuine cycles of feedback → revision → feedback, not imaginative completion.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment
- **Context Provision:** Good (Student provided essay content but did not discuss learning goals beyond task instructions.)
- **Strategic Planning:** Basic (Student discussed plans, but did not take steps to realize them.)
- **Critical Evaluation:** Limited (No evidence of considering or justifying choices from AI suggestions.)
- **Independent Editing:** Limited (No draft revisions, edits, or alternatives were submitted.)

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

1. **Essay Writing Skills:**  
   - Implement each revision step with clear, written sentences. Share actual revised thesis statements, topic sentences, and body paragraph edits for review.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills:**  
   - Engage in authentic revision cycles: absorb feedback, revise drafts, and reflect critically on suggestions. Avoid shortcutting the collaboration with "pretend" steps.
3. **Overall Improvement:**  
   - Treat training as a genuine learning exercise, applying both advice and revision independently and with the AI as process partner.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES

- Student completed conversation but did not show evidence-based revisions at any step. This session is useful to highlight the difference between "describing" revision and "doing" revision.
- Recommend instructor reinforce the importance of actual draft writing in revision cycles and set requirements for visible progress products at each stage (e.g., sharing revised sentences directly after each suggestion).
- Consider a follow-up session or guided intervention to model one full revision cycle for the student.

---

**Summary:**  
Student engaged with the AI assistant but did not complete the essential revision steps or provide written evidence of progress. Greater emphasis should be placed on moving beyond planning to authentic editing and critical interaction with feedback. Future sessions should require concrete written revisions and reflection at every stage.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this view. It’s key that citizens can influence the government, and even though personal green choices don’t affect much, they still play a role.

The most important way individuals can combat climate change is by influencing governments and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also take small steps to live more sustainably ,such as recycling, conserving water, or walking instead of driving. These actions are less impactful than government policies, but they still hold value. When many people adopt greener habits, they set a positive example for others and send a clear signal to companies that consumers want eco-friendly products. For example, if more people choose to buy from brands with sustainable practices, businesses will be more likely to prioritize sustainability to attract customers and boost profits. However, this approach has its limits. Some people prioritize convenience over eco-friendly choices and are unwilling to change their habits, which undermines these efforts. Even when a small group of people lives green, it is not enough to address the climate crisis if most people do not follow suit..

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:05:58.868Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let's assume you have now revised your thesis statement based on the feedback. Before we proceed: 

**Are you satisfied with your new thesis statement?**  
Remember, it should:
- Clearly answer the question about the significance of individual actions vs. those of governments/companies
- Preview the essay's main points (how citizens can influence governments; individual green habits matter too)
- Be confident and concise, without phrases like "I think…" or "maybe…"

If you’re happy with your revised thesis, let’s move to the next step!

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:07:03.385Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely, let’s work on revising your thesis statement! Here’s what you shared:

**Original Thesis Statement:**  
"Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

---

**Feedback & Suggestions:**

- It’s a bit too long—try to make it more concise so your main points are clearer.
- Avoid “I partly agree/I also think”—use stronger language.
- Make sure to directly preview your two main arguments: (1) citizen influence on government, and (2) individual green choices.
- You can drop extra background; focus on your answer and your main points.

---

**Would you like to try revising your thesis now?**  
Here are a few starter ideas you might use (but please write it in your own words!):

- “Although government and corporate action is crucial for tackling climate change, individual citizens play a significant role both by influencing policy and by adopting sustainable habits.”
- “While government and business decisions are essential, the efforts of individuals—through public pressure and personal choices—also contribute meaningfully to combating climate change.”

**Your turn:**  
Can you write a new thesis based on the feedback above? When you’re ready, please share your revised sentence here! I’ll be happy to review it and offer more suggestions if you’d like.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:07:08.247Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:08:13.492Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! Let’s move forward, imagining your thesis statement has now been revised to be clearer, more concise, and confident, and that it clearly previews your two main supporting points:  
1) Individuals influence government action;  
2) Personal green choices matter, too.

---

**Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**

Now, please choose **one** of your body paragraphs to improve.  
Would you like to revise:

- The first body paragraph (about individuals influencing government action),  
or  
- The second body paragraph (about individual green lifestyle choices)?

Once you decide, please copy and paste the **topic sentence** for the paragraph you want to work on.  
*The topic sentence is usually the first sentence of the paragraph—the one that introduces the main idea of that paragraph.*

When you share it, I’ll review it and give specific feedback. We’ll work together to make sure it matches your new thesis and clearly signals the paragraph’s focus.

Which paragraph shall we work on? And what is its topic sentence?

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:08:17.420Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement.I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:09:43.676Z

**Assistant:** Great, thanks for clarifying that you’d like to move forward using your revised thesis statement:

> “I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”

**Before we continue, a few reminders about this thesis:**
- It’s clearer now and sets up your two main points: (1) citizens’ influence on government, (2) personal green choices.
- If you want to make it even stronger, consider phrases like “Citizens can significantly impact government action, and personal green lifestyle choices, while less powerful, also contribute to addressing climate change.” (But only if you’re satisfied with your version, we’ll move on!)

**Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**

Let’s now move to revising the topic sentence for one body paragraph.

**Which paragraph do you want to revise?**
- The paragraph about citizens influencing government,  
or  
- The paragraph about personal green lifestyle choices?

Once you’ve chosen, please paste the original topic sentence from that paragraph here, so we can review it together.

**For your reference, your current topic sentences are:**

1. *“The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”*
2. *“On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.”*

**Which one would you like to work on? And can you paste that topic sentence here?**

Once you provide your choice and the topic sentence, I’ll help you revise it to connect strongly with your (new) thesis statement!

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:09:48.705Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:16:48.144Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your revised thesis statement:

> I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

Let’s review this thesis statement together!

---

**Thesis Review:**

- **Clarity**: Your main argument is clear—you believe citizens can influence the government and that individual choices are still meaningful.
- **Structure**: You introduce two main points, which is great for guiding your essay structure.
- **Strength**: The language is improved, but “I partly agree” and “I also think” are still somewhat tentative. In academic writing, it is good to use more definite language.
- **Conciseness**: There’s room to make the sentence tighter and more direct.
- **Preview**: You do preview your main arguments: influence on government and green lifestyle choices.

---

**Tips for Revision:**
- Try to express certainty about your viewpoint by removing words like “I partly agree” and “I also think.”
- Combine your two points in a way that clearly previews your essay’s structure.
- Keep your sentence direct and concise.

**Would you like to try revising your thesis statement one more time based on these tips?**  
Aim for a sentence that confidently states your position and previews your two main ideas!

Here are useful starter phrases, but please write your own version:
- “Citizens play a crucial role in addressing climate change by both influencing government policy and adopting sustainable lifestyle choices.”

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now? Just write one new sentence; I’ll review it before we move on to the next step!

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:16:56.548Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:18:07.971Z

**Assistant:** Perfect! We’ll move forward, assuming you have a stronger, clearer thesis statement that confidently says:  
Citizens play an essential role in addressing climate change by influencing government action and through their individual lifestyle choices.

---

**Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**

Please choose **one body paragraph** to focus on:
- The paragraph about individuals influencing government action, or
- The paragraph about individual green lifestyle choices.

Which paragraph would you like to revise?  
Once you pick, please copy and paste the **topic sentence** of that paragraph here so we can review it together.

Remember, the topic sentence is the first sentence of the paragraph and introduces its main idea. For reference, your originals are:

1. “The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”
2. “On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.”

**Which topic sentence would you like to improve?**  
Please let me know your choice and paste the sentence here!

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:18:11.628Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:19:25.840Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! Let’s focus on revising your topic sentence for the first body paragraph:

**Current Topic Sentence:**  
“The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”

---

### Feedback:

- **Clarity:** The sentence does introduce the idea of individuals influencing government.
- **Connection to Thesis:** To make a strong connection to your improved thesis, try emphasizing not just that this is “important,” but that this is a powerful or significant way that ordinary people contribute.
- **Specificity:** Naming the “way” is good, but you could reference “policy change” to make it even clearer.
- **Academic Tone:** Consider using more formal, academic vocabulary (e.g., “citizens” instead of “individuals”; “policy change” instead of just “help”).

---

### Some guiding questions:
- Does this sentence clearly explain *how* individuals can have an impact (through government action)?
- Is the tone confident and direct?
- Does it match your newly revised thesis statement’s language?

---

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence before I share examples?**  
You can focus on making clear that “influencing government policy” is a main way individuals address climate change.

Let me know your revision! (Just rewrite that ONE sentence, and I’ll review it.)

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:19:35.442Z

**You:** On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.Revise one body paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:20:08.240Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s move on to **Step 3: Revising the Rest of Your Chosen Paragraph** (on individual green lifestyle choices).

First, let’s double-check your **topic sentence** for this paragraph. Here is your original:

> “On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.”

**If you have revised your topic sentence, please paste your updated version here!**
If you haven’t yet, this is a great opportunity. Aim for a topic sentence that:
- Directly connects to your thesis (individual green choices matter, even if less impactful).
- Is confident and clear.

**Example starter (for inspiration only):**
- “In addition to influencing policy, individuals can contribute to climate change solutions by adopting sustainable habits in their daily lives.”

Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now? 
Once you have your revised version, we’ll continue to the supporting sentences!

---

**Now, let’s work on the supporting sentences in this paragraph. Here is your current draft:**

> These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

---

**Let’s revise for clarity, unity, and coherence. Try to answer these guiding questions:**

1. **Does every idea in the paragraph clearly relate to your revised topic sentence?**  
If not, can you clarify the link or adjust the order of sentences?

2. **Are your explanations and evidence clear?**  
For example, when you mention how individual actions send messages to companies, could you explain why this matters for overall climate action?

3. **Are there sentences that could use more precise vocabulary, or be made smoother?**  
For example, "so this is problem" — could you give a clearer explanation for why some people don’t change their habits?

4. **Do you offer examples or evidence to support your points?**  
Would you want to add a brief real-world example, or clarify with a statistic (if you know one)?

---

**Would you like to start by revising one or two sentences?**  
You can try rewriting one supporting sentence now (for example, the sentence: "But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem").  
Make it as clear and precise as you can. I’ll review it and help you further improve it!

Take your time—let’s focus on one part at a time so your writing stays strong and coherent.

**Assistant:** Wonderful! Thank you for sharing your revised thesis statement:

> “I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”

Let’s take a closer look before moving forward.

---

**Thesis Review and Final Feedback:**  
- Your thesis is now clear and presents your two main arguments.  
- It still contains phrases like “I partly agree” and “I also think,” which are a bit tentative for academic writing. Using more confident language such as “Citizens influence government decisions, and personal green choices also play an important role in tackling climate change” makes your position sound stronger.
- The thesis previews the structure: (1) citizens and government, (2) individual lifestyle choices.
- The thesis directly addresses the essay question—well done!

**Would you like to make your thesis even more confident and concise, or are you satisfied with it as is?**  
Let me know, and we’ll move to Step 2!

**Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**

You chose to work on the paragraph about **individual green lifestyle choices**. Here is your original topic sentence:

> “On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.”

**Feedback:**  
- The sentence introduces your point, but let’s make it connect more directly to your thesis—and add a bit more confidence.
- Instead of “small changes,” you might use “sustainable habits.”
- Signal why these habits matter, even if they are less impactful than what governments or companies do.

**Would you like to try revising this topic sentence now?**  
Aim for a sentence that makes a clear connection to your thesis and sets up your paragraph.

If you want help, here are a few model starters (please write your own!):  
- “Although large-scale policies are crucial, individuals contribute to climate change solutions through their sustainable lifestyle choices.”

Give your revised topic sentence a try—just write one sentence!

**Step 3: Revising the Supporting Sentences (Same Paragraph)**

Here’s your current supporting details:

> These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

**Let’s improve for:**
- Clarity: Do all sentences clearly connect to your topic sentence?
- Unity: Are there any off-topic or repeated ideas?
- Coherence: Is the logic easy to follow? Are transitions smooth?

**Guiding Questions:**  
1. Can you clarify your points about how individual choices influence companies?  
2. When talking about people not wanting to change, can you rephrase to explain why this is a challenge?
3. Is there a stronger transition you can use when discussing the limitations of individual action?

Would you like to try revising ONE of these supporting sentences now?  
For example, you could start with: “But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem.”  
Try rewriting it to be clearer and more academic. Share your revision, and I’ll review it and offer suggestions for the next sentence!

Let’s keep working step by step. What sentence would you like to revise first?

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:23:12.691Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:23:53.649Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s imagine you’ve revised your thesis statement, and now it’s confident and clearly previews your two main points. 

**Example of a Revised Thesis Statement:**
> Citizens play a vital role in addressing climate change both by influencing government action and by adopting sustainable lifestyle choices.

## Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision

You chose to work on the **body paragraph about individual green lifestyle choices**.

**Original Topic Sentence:**
> On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.

---

**Feedback:**

- The sentence introduces the main idea, but it can be more confident and more directly linked to your new thesis.
- Let’s replace “small changes” with “sustainable lifestyle choices” for precision.
- Try to signal that these choices contribute to a bigger solution, even if their impact is less than government action.

**Guiding Questions:**

- Does this sentence strongly link to the thesis by saying why personal choices still matter?
- Do you want to emphasize the positive, or also mention that these choices have limitations?

---

**Would you like to try revising this topic sentence now?**

Here’s a starter to inspire you (please write your own version!):

- “Although large-scale government policies are crucial, individuals also help combat climate change by adopting sustainable habits in their daily lives.”

Once you have your revised topic sentence, please share it here! I’ll give you feedback and then we’ll move on to revising your supporting sentences.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:23:57.689Z

**You:** and move on

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:24:14.564Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! Since you’ve chosen to work on the **body paragraph about individual green lifestyle choices**, and you’ve reviewed the topic sentence, let’s proceed step by step:

---

**Step 2 (continued): Confirm & Revise Topic Sentence**

Before we move to the supporting sentences, let’s make sure your topic sentence is confident and connects strongly to your revised thesis.

Your original:
> On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.

**Quick feedback:**
- It’s clear and introduces examples, but “small changes” is a little vague.
- You can use “sustainable habits” or “eco-friendly lifestyle choices” for more academic, precise vocabulary.
- Link back to your thesis: let readers know *why* these choices matter.

Once you share your revised topic sentence, here is **Step 3: Supporting Sentences Revision**

Let’s now work on the supporting details in your paragraph. Here is the draft:

> These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

**Guiding Questions:**
1. **Clarity**: Does every sentence directly relate to your new topic sentence?
2. **Explanation/Evidence**: Do your examples clearly show how personal choices matter?
3. **Transitions/Unity**: Are your ideas logically sequenced, and do transitions help the flow?
4. **Precision**: Can sentences such as “so this is problem” be made more precise and formal?
5. **Balance**: Do you mention both the potential and limitations of lifestyle choices effectively?

Let’s proceed step by step—**choose ONE supporting sentence to revise first** (*for example: “But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem.”*).

**Try rewriting it as clearly and academically as possible.**  
Post your revision, and I’ll review and offer suggestions before we continue to the next sentence.

Would you like to begin with that sentence, or choose another? Let me know which one you want to improve first!

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:24:22.433Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on bla bla bla ..

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:25:19.099Z

**Assistant:** Perfect! Let’s move forward, assuming you have a revised, confident thesis statement. Now we’re focusing on the **body paragraph about individual green lifestyle choices**.

---

**Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**

Your original topic sentence was:
> On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.

Let’s make sure your revised topic sentence:
- Connects *directly* to the new thesis  
- Uses confident academic language  
- Clearly introduces the main point of the paragraph

**For example (NOT for you to copy, just to inspire your own writing!):**
- “In addition to shaping government policy, individuals support the fight against climate change by adopting sustainable lifestyle choices.”

**Please type your revision of that topic sentence now.**  
Once you’ve updated it, paste it here—then we’ll move to revising the supporting sentences!

**Step 3: Revising Supporting Sentences (Same Paragraph)**

Here’s that section for convenience:
> These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

Let’s break it down.  
**Guiding Questions:**
1. Do your reasons/examples clearly support the revised topic sentence?
2. Is your explanation of “setting a good example” and “sending a message to companies” clear?
3. Are negative points (barriers/limits of individual action) expressed in a formal, academic way?

**Choose one supporting sentence to revise first (for example:**
> “But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem.”)

Rewrite that sentence to be clearer, more formal, and directly related to your main point.  
Post your revision here and we’ll continue working sentence by sentence.

Ready to revise? Which sentence would you like to start with?

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-11-13T14:26:48.309Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic, we're moving forward with a revised, confident thesis statement!

**Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision — Sustainable Lifestyle Choices Paragraph**

Let's quickly confirm your choice.  
We're working on the body paragraph about **individual green lifestyle choices**.

Your *original* topic sentence:
> On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.

**If you have already revised it, great—please paste your new version here!**  
If not, take a moment and see if you can strengthen it by:

- Using precise, academic language (for example, “adopt sustainable lifestyle choices” instead of “small changes”)
- Directly connecting the sentence to your revised thesis (remind the reader why these choices are included in your argument)
- Making your tone confident

**Example for inspiration (not for direct copying):**  
“Individuals further contribute to solving climate change by adopting sustainable behaviors in their daily lives.”

Would you like to try your own revision?  
Once you post your updated topic sentence, we'll review and make sure it matches your thesis before moving forward!

**Step 3: Support and Coherence Check**

Once your topic sentence is set, we'll work through the rest of the paragraph, one supporting idea at a time.

Here are the supporting sentences from your draft:

> These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

**Let’s approach this step by step!**

Choose ONE sentence from these supporting ideas that you’d like to revise first.  
For example:  
- “But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem.”

**Your task:**  
- Rewrite just that one sentence to be more clear, precise, and academically appropriate.
- Try to explain the point in one or two clear, logical sentences.

**Would you like to try revising that sentence now?**  
Once you post your revision, I’ll give you feedback or help you build an even better explanation.  
Let’s go at your pace—what revised supporting sentence would you like to share first?
