            ## Contribution Analysis

            It looks like your thesis statement revision process was thoughtful and showed clear progress toward a more academic and confident style. You successfully removed first-person phrasing like “I believe” and “this paper partly agrees,” and you identified both key points (citizen influence on government policy and personal green lifestyle choices).

However, the thesis can be polished further for clarity and directness by:

- Starting with a clear concessive clause like “While citizens’ influence is essential for government action,” to show balance.
- Avoiding awkward phrases like “partly agrees with that.”
- Being more precise about the impact or importance of each point.
- Combining the ideas into one confident, fluid sentence without filler phrases.

Here’s an example revision based on your work and the assistant’s final suggestion:

**Final polished thesis example:**

“While citizens’ influence is essential for driving large-scale government action on climate change, personal green lifestyle choices also play a meaningful role in combating environmental issues.”

If you’re satisfied with your thesis now or want to adopt this version, the next step is to revise the topic sentence of one of your body paragraphs to match the stronger thesis focus. Would you like assistance drafting or improving that topic sentence next?

- **Revised Essay Total: 79/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Several iterations of the thesis statement were attempted in chat, adopting more confident and academic wording.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - A revised topic sentence for a body paragraph was not provided.
  - No body paragraph or substantive content revision was completed; multiple opportunities to enhance analysis, vocabulary, and coherence were missed due to incomplete revision process.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 13** 
- **Conversation Quality:** 
  - The student followed the AI’s guidance through several rounds of thesis statement revision attempts, receiving specific feedback and suggestions. However, the process stopped before revising any topic sentence or body paragraph.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 – There are several back-and-forth exchanges regarding the thesis, showing some depth, but conversation was limited to the introduction and did not progress past the first step of the assignment.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 – The student responded to AI prompts and tried to act on feedback about clarity and academic tone but did not display critical evaluation or justification for accepting/rejecting suggestions.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 – The student's revisions were limited to the thesis statement, with multiple iterations, but there was no evidence of moving on to topic sentence or body paragraph revision as required; iteration and refinement were not completed.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 8/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Willingness to seek and respond to feedback iteratively on the thesis statement, showing openness to revision.
- Engagement with AI feedback on specificity, academic tone, and the function of each part of the thesis.
- Attempts at rephrasing for clarity and confidence, moving away from “I believe” to more formal statements.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Follow through on the complete revision cycle by ensuring all assigned tasks are attempted (topic sentence and body paragraph revision).
- Apply critical thinking by actively evaluating and questioning AI suggestions, rather than accepting all leading prompts.
- Broaden the scope of revision beyond the introduction to meaningfully increase overall essay quality.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good – The student understood and responded to instructions but relied on the AI to provide most assessment criteria.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement – The student did not move on to subsequent stages of the revision process, which suggests undeveloped self-direction.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement – The revision process reflected little personal critical assessment or justification for preferred thesis versions.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement – Edits were limited to thesis statement iterations, with no substantive independent expansion to other key essay sections.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Make sure to complete all revision tasks assigned (thesis, topic sentence, and body paragraph) for full practice and skill development.
2. When collaborating with AI, move beyond just accepting surface-level feedback—ask clarifying questions, suggest alternatives, and justify your choices.
3. Practice applying revision skills independently to different parts of your essay, using AI suggestions as a springboard rather than a script.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
The student made a strong start on thesis revision, thoughtfully responding to feedback, but did not proceed to revise a topic sentence or a body paragraph. Recommend that future training sessions require students to demonstrate evidence of all checklist revisions before assessment. Consider providing checklists or progress trackers to support complete task follow-through.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. This paper partly agrees with that while the power of citizens can  influence the large-scale actions of government, personal green lifestyle choices  still contribute to combating climate change as well.


The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:14:51.175Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:19:03.609Z

**Assistant:** Great! Thank you for sharing your current thesis statement:
> "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Let’s start by reviewing your thesis together:

**Clarity**:  
- Your opinion ("partly agree") is clear, which is good.
- The thesis covers both main points: influencing government and personal choices.
- The sentence is long and could be easier to follow if it’s more concise.

**Strength**:  
- Phrases like "I believe" and "I partly agree" make your stance softer. Academic writing usually prefers more direct language.
- Using "I think" or "I believe" is best avoided for a stronger, more confident thesis.

**Focus**:  
- Your thesis does hint at your essay’s structure (government influence and personal choice).
- However, being more specific about why these matter will make it more focused.
- Try to mention what each role actually achieves (e.g., "drives major change," "sets an example," etc.)

**Tips for Revision:**  
- Directly answer the essay question in confident language.
- Clearly indicate your two main points and how they fit together.
- Try to use “Although/While X, Y…” or “Both…and…” for parallel structure if it helps.

**Would you like to try revising your thesis now? If you want, you can focus on making it:**
- Shorter and more straightforward
- Free from "I think"/"I believe"
- Clear about your two main points and how they relate to the topic

*Let’s see your revision, and I’ll give you some feedback before we continue!*

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:19:25.371Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:26:48.718Z

**Assistant:** Great—thanks for sharing your current thesis statement again. Let’s work on revising it!

Here are some guiding questions to help you:
- Can you make your thesis more direct by removing “I believe” and “I partly agree”?
- Can you tell us clearly: What can citizens achieve by influencing the government? What is the role of personal green choices?

Try rewriting it like this:
- Start with “While…” or “Although…,” and then mention both the government and personal actions.
- Preview your two main arguments—what are their actual effects?

Would you like to rewrite your thesis now, keeping it clear, confident, and specific?  
Go ahead and share your revision—just your thesis statement, please!

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:26:51.121Z

**You:** While this paper partly agrees with this idea since citizens can still influence the government, it also suggests that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:28:38.374Z

**Assistant:** That’s a solid revision! You removed “I believe,” which makes your thesis stronger. Your two main points (influencing the government and green lifestyle choices) are clear.

Let’s make sure your thesis is:

- **Direct and confident**
- **Specific about the effects of each main point**
- **A clear roadmap for your essay**

**Feedback:**
- The phrase “this paper partly agrees” is more academic, but it can still be more straightforward and specific.
- It might help to say what the individual and personal choices achieve (e.g., “drive policy change” or “encourage sustainable habits”).
- Try to reduce wordiness and clarify the parallel structure between your two points.

**Questions to consider for your next revision:**
- What is the main way citizens influence climate change—with government action or personal choices?
- Can you state briefly *how* government influence is “important” and what role personal choices play?

**Example of focus (do not copy, just inspiration):**
- “While large-scale change depends on government action influenced by citizens, individuals’ green lifestyle decisions also contribute to combating climate change.”

Would you like to try one more revision, making your stance even more clear and the language more precise?  
When you’re happy with your thesis, let me know and we’ll move to revising a body paragraph!

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:28:48.322Z

**You:** While this paper partly agrees with that citizens can still influence the large-scale actions of government, it also suggests that personal green lifestyle choices  still contribute to combating climate change .

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:32:27.555Z

**Assistant:** Great job strengthening your thesis! You have made it more academic and avoided “I believe,” which is excellent progress. Here’s my feedback and a couple more suggestions to make it even clearer and more confident:

**Positive points:**
- You identify the two main areas: citizens influencing government, and personal green choices.
- You use a more formal, academic tone, which fits your course.

**Suggestions:**
- The phrase "partly agrees with that citizens can still influence..." could be clearer and more direct if you just state the relationship (e.g., "Although citizens have the power to influence...").
- “Still contribute” could be a bit more specific—maybe mention what kind of contribution or why it matters.
- The thesis could be one strong, balanced sentence.

Try to include:
- What is the *most* important way individuals impact climate change?
- What is the secondary (but still relevant) way?
- Use a clear connector: “While/Although... , ... also...”

**Would you like to rewrite your thesis one more time, trying to:**
- Use a phrase like, “While citizens’ power to influence government is vital for major change, individuals’ green lifestyle choices also play a meaningful role in combating climate change.”
- Or you can try your own version! Aim for one confident sentence that previews BOTH your main arguments and states how they work together.

Would you like to try revising your thesis now, or are you happy with your current version?  
Let me know when you’re satisfied so we can move to revising a body paragraph’s topic sentence!

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:32:32.936Z

**You:** This paper partly agrees with that while the power of citizens can  influence the large-scale actions of government, personal green lifestyle choices  still contribute to combating climate change as well.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:34:28.763Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your revised thesis:

> This paper partly agrees with that while the power of citizens can influence the large-scale actions of government, personal green lifestyle choices still contribute to combating climate change as well.

**Feedback:**

**Strengths:**
- You have clarified both main arguments: (1) citizen influence on government, and (2) personal green choices.
- The thesis now uses more academic language.

**Areas to refine:**
- The phrase “partly agrees with that while…” is a bit awkward and unclear. You don’t need to write “This paper,” and it’s clearer to avoid “partly agrees.”
- The thesis should be one confident, direct sentence. The connector “while” at the start works best.
- Try to be specific about *how* each action impacts climate change (e.g., government action = large-scale change; personal action = ongoing contribution).

**Guidance for revision:**
- Start with “While” or “Although” for parallel structure.
- Skip phrases like “this paper agrees.”
- Be precise about the effects of each action.

**Would you like to try one more time?**
Consider:
- “While citizens’ influence is essential for achieving significant government action against climate change, individual green lifestyle choices also make a meaningful difference.”

Now, please try revising your thesis once more in your own words, with these points in mind!  
When you’re satisfied, let me know so we can move to Step 2: revising the topic sentence of a body paragraph.
