### 1) Summary of the Meeting Plan Developed

The student initiated the planning process by stating three fundamental learning objectives centered on the digital gaming activity with elderly participants: mastering basic game operations, selecting appropriate in-game characters, and organizing a tournament. The assistant encouraged the student to broaden these objectives beyond technical skills to include digital literacy, intergenerational communication, teamwork, and community engagement. The dialogue reflected a collaborative refinement of goals toward a holistic six-lesson series focused on fostering both competence in the game *Brawl Stars* and meaningful social interaction between HKBU students and elderly participants.

The meeting plan revolved around balancing digital skill-building with social objectives, culminating in an e-sports tournament designed to enhance active aging and social inclusion. The student demonstrated openness to framing objectives in terms of academic learning, service learning, and community impact.

Fantastic! Let’s begin by clarifying the **ultimate learning objectives** for your six-lesson series. Before mapping out each session, we need clear, overarching goals that express both the **academic learning outcomes** and the **community impact** you want your students and elderly partners to achieve by the end.

Let’s start with this key question:

**What are two or three “big picture” outcomes that you hope every participant will achieve across all six sessions—including both the HKBU students and the elderly?**
- Think about skills, attitudes, community impact, and intergenerational learning.
- Consider both success in the game (Brawl Stars) and broader outcomes (digital literacy, social connection, service-learning values).

Try listing your ultimate objectives in bullet points!

### 👤 **You** (下午11:30:11)

ultimate learning objectives
1. 學識遊戲的基本操作 2. 選擇適合的角色出賽 3.建立比賽

### 🤖 **Assistant** (下午11:30:16)

Great start! You’ve identified three core goals:
1. Learn the basic operations of the game (Brawl Stars)
2. Choose suitable characters for competition
3. Organize a tournament

Now, let’s rephrase and expand these slightly to ensure they fully capture both the academic/service-learning value and the benefit to the elderly community. Consider:
- Digital skills and confidence (academic outcome)
- Social bonding and intergenerational communication (community impact)
- Teamwork and collaborative event organization (service-learning value)

**Here’s a model to help inspire your revised ultimate objectives:**
- Enhance digital literacy and confidence in mobile gaming for both students and elderly participants.
- Foster intergenerational communication, teamwork, and mutual understanding through collaborative e-sports activities.
- Empower elderly participants to take part in, and help organize, a friendly e-sports tournament, promoting active aging and social inclusion.

**Your turn:**  
Would you like to revise your objectives now, or do you want feedback and suggestions for integrating community and academic aspects more clearly?
