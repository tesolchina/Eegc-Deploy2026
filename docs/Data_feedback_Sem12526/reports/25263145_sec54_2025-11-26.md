            ## Contribution Analysis

            Based on the detailed assessment and chat history, here is a concise summary with actionable advice tailored to advancing your revision process effectively:

---

### Key Points from Your Training Assessment

- You have a good original essay foundation: clear position, relevant examples, basic structure.
- The AI assistant provided thorough, step-by-step guidance to revise thesis, topic sentences, and paragraphs.
- However, your responses repeatedly used placeholders (“let’s pretend…,” “bla bla bla”) instead of actual revised text.
- This led to no measurable improvement in content, organization, vocabulary, or grammar.
- The interaction was procedural rather than substantive; no real drafting or critical evaluation of AI suggestions occurred.

---

### What You Can Do Next

To get the most from AI-assisted revision and demonstrate your revision skills, please try the following:

1. **Submit a revised thesis statement now:**  
   Write 1-2 sentences that clearly state your position and preview two main reasons your essay will discuss.  
   Example template:  
   *"I partly agree that while governments and big companies play the largest role in combating climate change, citizens can also contribute significantly by influencing policy through voting and protests, and by adopting green lifestyle choices that encourage sustainable business practices."*  

2. **Revise the first body paragraph topic sentence:**  
   Make it a confident claim that relates directly to your thesis.  
   Example:  
   *"Individuals influence government policy on climate change mainly through voting and public activism, which can pressure politicians to adopt stronger environmental laws."*  

3. **Rewrite the first body paragraph using clear, grammatically correct sentences:**  
   Provide concrete examples, avoid filler, and fix errors. For instance, replace “maybe just listen a little” with “may only respond superficially,” and clarify cause-effect relationships.

4. **Engage critically with AI feedback:**  
   After posting each revision, state if you accept the suggestion, or want to modify it further, explaining why.

5. **Aim for iterative drafts:**  
   Submit your revisions in stages—thesis first, then topic sentence, then paragraph—to receive targeted feedback and improve effectively.

### Why This Matters

- Concrete revised texts allow the AI assistant to provide precise guidance on vocabulary, grammar, and coherence.  
- Avoiding placeholders demonstrates your active participation and helps develop your independent editing skills.  
- Iterative, focused revisions build your confidence and improve your essay significantly over time.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - Good. The essay presents a clear, balanced position (“I partly agree… citizens can still influence the government… personal green lifestyle choices… still have a role to play”) and gives relevant examples (voting, protests, consumer pressure). However, ideas are general and underdeveloped in places.
- Organization: 20/25 - Good. The essay follows a clear introduction–body–conclusion structure and each paragraph has a single focus. Transitions and logical development are sometimes repetitive and a few sentences break flow.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Satisfactory. Vocabulary is adequate but simple and repetitive (e.g., repeated use of “people,” “help,” “do,” “maybe”). Limited use of topic-specific or precise academic language.
- Grammar: 17/25 - Satisfactory. Several grammatical errors and awkward phrases reduce clarity (examples: “the government maybe just listen a little,” “so is not always working well,” “nothing happen,” “so this is problem”).
- **Original Essay Total: 75/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - Satisfactory. The revised version contains placeholders rather than substantive changes: e.g., “bla bla bla... (revised thesis statement here).” Because the thesis, topic sentences, and paragraph revisions were not actually provided, there is no demonstrated improvement in content development.
- Organization: 17/25 - Needs Improvement/Satisfactory. The structure is still present, but placeholders interrupt coherence (e.g., “revised topic sentence bla bla bla… revise the rest of body paragraph #1 ...”). Without actual revision content, organization cannot be shown to have improved.
- Vocabulary: 17/25 - Satisfactory. No meaningful vocabulary enhancement is visible; placeholder text prevents assessment of any enrichment.
- Grammar: 16/25 - Needs Improvement. The revised draft still includes original grammatical issues and adds placeholders; no corrective edits are visible.
- **Revised Essay Total: 68/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -7 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - The chat shows that the student received clear, actionable guidance on how to revise the thesis and topic sentences (evidence in assistant prompts).
  - The student demonstrated awareness of revision steps by indicating intent to revise (“let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement…”).
  - The original essay contained a coherent argumentative structure that could be built on (foundation present).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The student did not paste or produce the revised thesis; the revised essay contains a placeholder instead of a new thesis. This prevented any measurable improvement to the thesis statement.
  - The student did not supply a concrete revised topic sentence; placeholders remain in the revised draft.
  - The body paragraph 1 was not edited — it contains a placeholder instruction rather than a finished revision. Grammar, precise vocabulary, and clearer examples were not implemented.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 8** (assistant prompts and user replies in the provided chat).
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided structured, stepwise guidance and explicit revision templates. The student repeatedly declined to supply actual revisions and used placeholders (“let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement”, “bla bla bla...”); therefore the interaction was procedural but not productive in producing real revisions.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 - Basic. The assistant initiated a detailed, scaffolded revision process and gave multiple directives. The student’s responses were short and mainly declarative (“let's pretend…”, “ok let's revise the rest… bla bla bla”), with no substantive drafting or follow-up questions. Evidence: assistant asked for the revised thesis and topic sentence multiple times; user responded with placeholders rather than text.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - Basic. There is little evidence the student critically evaluated the assistant’s suggestions. The student acknowledged the prompts but did not accept or reject specific suggestions with reasons. Example: assistant: “Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now?” user: “let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on”.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - Basic. The assistant requested iterative steps (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph revision). The chat shows planning but no real iterations of student drafts. The student repeatedly skipped steps instead of providing revisions to be refined.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 6/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student’s original essay shows a clear, balanced position and basic use of relevant examples (e.g., “if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment…”).
- The assistant provided strong, structured guidance (templates for thesis and topic sentences, stepwise process).
- The student shows awareness of the revision process and the steps needed (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), as indicated by their statements to “pretend” steps were done.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- The student must produce concrete revisions in response to AI prompts. Replace placeholders with actual revised sentences to enable assessment and further iteration.
- Strengthen grammar and sentence-level accuracy (fix subject-verb agreement, article use, and sentence completeness).
- Use more precise vocabulary and stronger academic phrasing in the thesis and topic sentences (avoid hedging like “I believe,” “I also think”).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student provided the original essay but did not supply revised drafts despite assistant prompts; this limited the AI’s ability to help effectively.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student and assistant followed a logical revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph). The student acknowledged the plan but failed to execute the steps.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student did not provide evidence of evaluating or selecting among AI suggestions.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - No actual revisions were submitted by the student for the assistant to critique or refine.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Provide concrete revisions when asked: paste the revised thesis sentence, the revised topic sentence, and the revised paragraph text. This enables iterative improvement and assessment.
2. Address the most frequent grammar errors identified in the original draft (article usage, verb forms, sentence fragments). Consider using short, focused grammar checks after each revision.
3. Use the assistant’s templates but produce specific content: write a confident thesis that previews two reasons (e.g., “I partly agree because citizens can pressure governments through voting and protest, and consumer choices can influence business practices”), then craft topic sentences that directly link to those reasons.
4. Engage critically with AI suggestions: accept or reject proposed changes and explain why, so the assistant can tailor feedback.
5. Aim for at least three concrete revision cycles (draft → assistant feedback → revised draft) to demonstrate iterative refining.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student followed the recommended revision sequence in plan but did not submit actual revisions; the current evidence is insufficient to confirm mastery of AI-assisted revision skills.
- Recommend a short required follow-up: ask the student to submit (a) one revised thesis sentence, (b) one revised topic sentence, and (c) the fully revised first body paragraph. Once these concrete items are posted, a new assessment can be completed showing measurable improvement.
- Consider prompting the student with a minimal deliverable in the next session (e.g., “Paste one revised thesis sentence of 1–2 lines now”) to reduce avoidance via placeholders.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. bla bla bla... (revised thesis statement here)

 revised topic sentence bla bla bla… When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. revise the rest of body paragraph #1 ...

*Time:* 2025-11-26T15:22:11.075Z

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T15:07:56.368Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T15:09:31.695Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — that thesis is a good starting point. Quick feedback on clarity, strength, and focus:

- Clarity: You clearly state you “partly agree,” which answers the question. But the wording is a little vague about how much you agree and what exactly the two sides are (government/corporations vs individuals).
- Strength: It is cautious but a bit weak. Phrases like “I believe” and “I also think” make it less confident. Aim for firmer language that shows a clear, measured position.
- Focus/preview: The thesis mentions two ideas (influencing government; personal lifestyle choices) but doesn’t preview how your essay will develop them. Your revised thesis should briefly indicate the two main points you will discuss and how they relate to the overall claim.

Actionable tips for your revision
- State the extent of your agreement more precisely (e.g., “largely agree,” “partly agree because…”).
- Name the two main reasons/points you will discuss (for example: political influence and consumer/behavioral influence).
- Use confident, direct language and keep it concise.
- Use a simple template to follow: “[Extent of agreement] because [reason 1] and [reason 2], which shows [overall implication].”

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now? Paste your revised version, and I’ll give quick, focused feedback. (We’ll move on to a body paragraph only after you’re satisfied with the thesis.)

*Time:* 2025-11-26T15:09:44.456Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on
bla bla bla...

*Time:* 2025-11-26T15:13:27.657Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s follow the three-step process. First, quick check about the thesis:

1) Do you want me to see the revised thesis, or should I assume it now clearly says you “partly/mostly agree” and previews two main points: (a) citizens influence governments/policy and (b) personal green choices influence behaviour/markets? Please paste the exact revised thesis or type YES if that description is accurate and you’re happy to move on.

Once the thesis is confirmed, step 2:

2) Which body paragraph would you like to work on? 
- Paragraph 1: individuals influencing government and politicians (stronger, policy focus) 
- Paragraph 2: individuals’ personal lifestyle changes and consumer pressure (behaviour/market focus)

Tell me which paragraph, and paste its current topic sentence. I’ll give focused feedback on how well it connects to the (confirmed) thesis and what to change.

Hints for revising the topic sentence (use these when you try your revision):
- Make a clear claim that ties directly to the thesis (state how this paragraph supports your “partly agree” position).
- Name the mechanism (e.g., voting, protests, public pressure, petitions) so the reader knows how individuals have influence.
- Avoid hedging language like “I think” or “maybe”; use confident verbs (e.g., “enable,” “prompt,” “pressure”).
- Keep it concise and set up the paragraph’s development (show you will give examples or explain limits).

A short template you can use (fill in the pieces): 
[Clear claim about individuals’ role] + [mechanism they use to influence policy] + [signal that you will give evidence or mention limits].

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now? Paste your attempt and I’ll give targeted feedback before we revise the rest of the paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T15:13:47.783Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on
 bla bla bla…

*Time:* 2025-11-26T15:18:12.645Z

**Assistant:** Nice — let’s follow the three-step process carefully. I’ll guide you step by step. First: please paste your current revised thesis statement (the exact sentence you plan to use). If you prefer, type YES only if this description below exactly matches your revised thesis and you’re happy to move on:
- You “partly/mostly agree” with the statement, and
- You preview two clear reasons: (1) citizens can influence government/policy, and (2) personal green choices influence behaviour and markets.

Quick guidance while you prepare your thesis:
- Be specific about the extent of your agreement (e.g., “partly agree” or “largely agree”).
- Preview the two main points in one concise sentence.
- Use confident language (avoid “I think” or “maybe”).
- Template you can use (fill the parts): “[Degree of agreement] because [reason 1: policy influence] and [reason 2: individual/consumer influence], which shows [overall implication for action].”

Paste the revised thesis now (or type YES). I’ll give focused feedback and we’ll not move on until you’re satisfied.

After the thesis is confirmed, I’ll ask you to choose a paragraph:
- Paragraph 1: individuals influencing government and politicians (policy focus)
- Paragraph 2: individuals’ personal lifestyle changes and consumer pressure (behaviour/market focus)

Tell me which paragraph you want to work on and paste its current topic sentence. If you’d like help shaping the topic sentence, use this frame (fill the slots):
- Claim about role + mechanism of influence + signal of evidence/limit (for example: “[Claim about individuals’ political influence] through [mechanism: voting, protests, petitions], which [evidence or limitation I will show].”)

Would you like to paste the thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T15:18:32.785Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1 

bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-11-26T15:19:16.748Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m ready to help, and I like your energy. Quick reminder of the process: before we revise the rest of paragraph 1, we must finish Step 1 (thesis revision) and Step 2 (topic sentence revision). I can’t edit the paragraph content until those two are confirmed.

1) Please paste your exact revised thesis statement (the full sentence you want to use). If you prefer, type YES only if this description exactly matches your revised thesis and you’re fully happy to move on:
- You “partly/mostly agree” with the statement, and
- You preview two clear reasons: (1) citizens can influence government/policy, and (2) personal/consumer choices influence behaviour and markets.

Quick checklist for the thesis while you paste it:
- Does it clearly answer the question (extent of agreement)?
- Does it preview the two main points you will discuss?
- Is the language confident and concise (no “I think,” “maybe,” or hedging)?

If the thesis still needs work, try this short template (fill the pieces — don’t worry, I’ll give feedback):
[Degree of agreement] because [reason 1: how citizens influence policy] and [reason 2: how individual/consumer choices affect behaviour/markets], which shows [overall implication for collective action].

2) Once the thesis is confirmed, paste the topic sentence you want to use for paragraph 1 (current draft: “The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.” — tell me if you want to revise this). If you want to revise it, try this brief frame:
[Clear claim about individuals’ political influence] + [mechanism: voting/protests/petitions/public pressure] + [signal that you will give evidence or note limits].

Would you like to paste the revised thesis now? After we confirm that, paste or rewrite the paragraph 1 topic sentence and I’ll give focused feedback so you can revise it before we edit the rest of the paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T15:19:30.856Z
