## Contribution Analysis

Your essay shows clear strengths in structure, argument development, and use of examples. Here’s a focused final review summarizing key points and suggesting targeted edits:

---

### 1. Thesis Statement  
**Current:**  
*Automation in factories enhances employment prospects in the long term, it upskills labour and provides new jobs, despite job replacement.*

**Suggestion:**  
Avoid comma splice; try:  
**“Automation in factories enhances employment prospects in the long term because it upskills labour and provides new jobs, despite job replacement.”**  
Or split into two sentences for clarity.

---

### 2. First Body Paragraph  
- Change **“push the standard production”** → “improves production standards” or “raises production quality.”  
- Revise:  
  *“it provides opportunities to labour upskill themselves for other positions”* → “it provides workers opportunities to upskill for other positions.”  
- Break long sentence:  
  *“Then, the repetitive process replaced by AI, the workers can work...”* → “Repetitive processes are replaced by AI. Consequently, workers can take on more complex roles, such as operating machines and checking products.”  
- Clarify “production process is becoming more stable that labour can have safer working environment...” → “The production process has become more stable, providing workers with safer environments and more regular hours.”

---

### 3. Second Body Paragraph  
- Fix typo: **“idustries” → “industries”**  
- Change:  
  *“allow exchange the market information”* → “allow exchange of market information”  
- Break into clearer sentences:  
  *“So, it can attract more talents around the world and allow exchange ...”* → “As a result, it attracts talents worldwide and facilitates the exchange of information among industries, allowing workers access to global job markets.”  
- Expand briefly on benefits of remote work / global collaboration for employees.

---

### 4. Third Body Paragraph (Counterargument and Response)  
- Replace:  
  *“imputed before can be trained”* → “previous resources and manpower can be used for training”  
- Clarify:  
  *“low-ended process”* → “routine tasks”  
- Improve grammar:  
  *“leading low-skilled labour become high-skilled labour”* → “helping low-skilled labour become high-skilled.”  
- Consider adding a concrete example of a human role (e.g., maintenance technician, quality control specialist).

---

### 5. Conclusion  
- Correct “In conclude,” → “In conclusion,”  
- Clarify and smooth:  
  *“pushes the improvement of jobs and creates global market network, which upgrades employment prospects worldwide”* →  
  “In conclusion, automation enhances employment prospects worldwide by improving job quality and creating global market networks.”  
- Fix grammar:  
  *“Also, automation reduces issues such as unfair pay and excessive working hours that affected cheap labour in the past, because automation means factories no longer rely on large pools of cheap labour.”* →  
  “Automation also reduces issues such as unfair pay and excessive working hours by decreasing the reliance on large pools of cheap labour.”  
- Smooth final sentence:  
  *“Under the advancement of automation, it is hoped that workers’ quality and treatment will improve gradually, so that sweatshop conditions are eliminated, and global trade will benefit everyone.”* →  
  “As automation advances, it is hoped that workers’ conditions will gradually improve, sweatshop practices will be eliminated, and global trade will benefit all.”

---

### General Notes  
- Fix typos:  
  “idustries,” “imputed,” “disapeared,” “reducesthe”  
- Avoid run-on sentences and comma splices throughout.  
- Use linking phrases for smoother flow (As a result, Therefore, Furthermore, For example).  
- Keep academic tone by avoiding colloquialisms and personal phrases unless required.  
- Consider slight vocabulary upgrades: “upskill” → “develop new skills,” “labour” consistent spelling (British vs American).

---

### Would you like me to:  
- Edit one or two key sentences fully with polished wording?  
- Or provide a brief clean-up rewrite of a paragraph?  
- Or are you ready to submit after this final review?

You’ve made excellent progress with logical argumentation and structure — a few polishing touches will ensure your essay’s clarity and academic tone are outstanding. Let me know how you want to proceed!

## Complete Conversation
**Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Automation in factories enhances employment prospects in the long term, it upskills labour and provides new jobs, despite job replacement.

The introduction of automation in factories has shifted demand away from unskilled workers to machines, which leads to the need for workers to up skill and attain more stable positions. Before the development of technology, production factories often relied on pools of cheap labour, requiring lowering the costs, which causing bad working conditions and low wages for employees. Technology can boost the efficiency and quality of products, push the standardised production. As a result, the repetitive process replaced by AI, the workers can work in other positions and more complex work such as controlling the machine and checking the products, it provides opportunities to labour upskill themselves for other positions. As a result, the production process is becoming more stable so that labour can have safer working environment and more regular hours at the same time.

Automation in factories has enabled industries and employees to form a global network without barriers of time and place, enhancing more global collaboration, which also creates more job opportunities. These global networks support remote communication and work. For example, employees can apply and join various positions through automated communication platforms. So, it can attract more talents around the world and allow exchange of market information between different industries, and access to jobs worldwide.

Some critics argue that the automation in production and technology development only benefits talents and headquarters, it will cause unemployment of cheap labour. However, there are still some roles that humans need to carry out, which still provide employment such as maintenance and products designing. Previous resources and manpower can be used for training to improve employees’ skills but not only routine tasks. Helping low-skilled labour to become high-skilled labour.

In conclusion, the development of automation pushes the improvement of jobs and creates global market networks, which upgrades employment prospects worldwide. Also, automation reduces issues such as unfair pay and excessive working hours that affected cheap labour in the past, because automation means factories no longer rely on large pools of cheap labour. Under the advancement of automation, it is hoped that workers’ quality and treatment will improve gradually, the sweatshop conditions are eliminated, and global trade will benefit everyone.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-05T08:52:54.978Z

**You:** Personally, technological shift to the industries enhance global employment prospects in long term. Carrying the machine in the industries will replaced the workers obviously in long term, but it actually push the upgrading of global employment. 
  Before the development of technology, production factories often input and emphasis a pool of cheap labour, so the factories may shift to everywhere and demand the cheap labour which leads to the unstable working environment and low income for the employee. Technology can boost the efficiency and quality off products, push the standard production of the industries. The repetitive process replaced by AI, so the worker can work on other position and more complex work such as controlling the machine. The factories’ producing is becoming more stable at the same time.
  Besides, there are some countries that work on designing and managing part of the industries, technology advancement must convenient for them, which produce the global supply chain and connection with different industries around the world without time and place barriers. It also benefit to the employees commuting around the world.
  Some of the people may argued that the automation production and technology development only beneficial for talents and headquarters, it will cause the unemployment of cheap labour. As I mentioned, there are some position need human to carry out. While a country can make use of automation machine, most of the labour may not need to produce themselves, but able to work on different position, which economic condition is link with social state.
  Therefore, the development of automation push the improvement of works and produce global market network, which enhance the global employment prospects. Also, it reduce the unfair pay and long time working time of workers because of the requirement of large amount of labour that exceed factories ability before disappearing.

**"Does automation shifting in factories enhance or undermine employment prospects?"**

And your opinion is that **automation can enhance employment prospects**.

Could you now please share your current thesis statement for this essay? (Just copy the sentence or sentences from your introduction that state your main argument or answer the essay question.) This will help us begin the revision process with a clear starting point!

If you haven’t written one yet, you can draft what you think is your thesis statement, and I’ll help you improve it.

*Time:* 2025-11-05T09:18:02.303Z

**You:** Personally, technological shift to the industries enhance global employment prospects in long term. Carrying the machine in the industries will replaced the workers obviously in long term, but it actually push the upgrading of global employment.

*Time:* 2025-11-05T09:18:59.245Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement:

> "Personally, technological shift to the industries enhance global employment prospects in long term. Carrying the machine in the industries will replaced the workers obviously in long term, but it actually push the upgrading of global employment."

**Feedback and Suggestions:**

- **Clarity:** The thesis currently uses general phrases ("technological shift," "carrying the machine") that could be more precise.  
- **Focus:** The argument is present but could be stated more clearly (automation leads to better employment, despite initial job losses).
- **Strength:** Avoid phrases like "Personally," to make the thesis statement more academic and confident.
- **Preview of Structure:** Try to mention your main reasons or how automation enhances employment prospects.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can you rephrase your thesis to clearly answer the essay question (Does automation in factories enhance or undermine employment prospects?)?
- Can you hint at the main ideas you will talk about (for example, how automation creates new jobs, the need for upskilling, or opportunities in other sectors)?

**Encouragement:**
Would you like to try revising your thesis statement to make it more direct, academic, and structured? Aim for one or two clear, assertive sentences!

Let me know when you’re ready, or if you’d like more hints!

*Time:* 2025-11-05T09:19:03.850Z

**You:** It is believed that technological shift to the industries enhance global employment prospects in long term. Although, the machine will replaced the assembly process, but it provide the chance to upskill labour.For example, teaching them how to manage the machine which also create new positions for labour.

*Time:* 2025-11-05T09:39:19.168Z

**Assistant:** Great job drafting a revised thesis statement! Let’s review it together:

**Your revised thesis statement:**

> "It is believed that technological shift to the industries enhance global employment prospects in long term. Although, the machine will replaced the assembly process, but it provide the chance to upskill labour.For example, teaching them how to manage the machine which also create new positions for labour."

**Feedback:**

- **Clarity:** There are some grammar errors (“technological shift to the industries” should be “technological shift in industries” and “the machine will replaced” should be “machines will replace”). Also, join your ideas into one or two flowing sentences.
- **Strength:** Try to use confident, academic language. Remove “It is believed that...” and say what you believe.
- **Focus:** Preview the structure—mention both replacement and upskilling/new job opportunities.
- **Precision:** Be specific: use “automation” or “the use of machines in factories”.

**Hint:**  
A strong thesis directly answers the question and previews main points.  
For example, “Automation in factories enhances employment prospects in the long term because it requires workers to upskill and creates new job opportunities, despite initial job displacement.” (Please do NOT copy this; use it as a model for your own rewrite.)

**Your Turn:**  
Would you like to try revising your thesis statement again, using these suggestions? Aim for one or two clear sentences that show your position and briefly mention your supporting ideas.

Let me know your new version when you’re ready!

*Time:* 2025-11-05T09:39:25.703Z

**You:** I believe that automation in factories enhances employment prospects in long term. Although machine will replaced the assembly process, but it upskill labour and provide new job opportunities.

*Time:* 2025-11-05T09:43:53.780Z

**Assistant:** Excellent effort! Let’s review your latest thesis statement:

> "I believe that automation in factories enhances employment prospects in long term. Although machine will replaced the assembly process, but it upskill labour and provide new job opportunities."

**Feedback:**

- **Clarity:** The message is strong, but some grammar adjustments are needed (“in the long term”, “machines will replace”, and “it upskills labor”).
- **Strength:** “I believe” is okay, but for a more academic tone you could simply state your argument directly.
- **Structure:** Good preview—you mention displacement and new opportunities. Try to join your points smoothly for flow.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can you combine the sentences into one clear statement?
- Can you use confident and precise language (without “I believe”)?
- Would you specify “automation in factories” and its results (displacement, upskilling, new jobs)?

**Encouragement:**  
You’re close! Try writing your thesis as one sentence, directly answering the question and previewing your two reasons: job displacement, but new opportunities from upskilling.

Would you like to try one more revision now, making it clear, precise, and academically confident?

Let me know when you’re ready!

*Time:* 2025-11-05T09:43:58.815Z

**You:** Automation in factories enhances employment prospects in the long term. Although it causes job displacement, but it upskills labour and provide new jobs.

*Time:* 2025-11-05T09:47:31.922Z

**Assistant:** Great work revising your thesis statement! Let’s take a closer look before moving forward:

**Your current thesis statement:**
> Automation in factories enhances employment prospects in the long term. Although it causes job displacement, but it upskills labour and provide new jobs.

**Feedback:**

- **Clarity and flow:** There’s a slight issue with connecting the two sentences—consider how the second part is linked.  
- **Grammar:** Watch out for subject-verb agreement: “it upskills labour and provides new jobs.”
- **Academic tone:** The thesis could be stronger if you combine your ideas into one confident sentence (and avoid “Although...but…”).
- **Preview:** Your main points are clear: job displacement, upskilling, new job creation.

**Guiding Question:**  
Can you join this into one sentence, using confident language, and previewing your main points without unnecessary words?

**Hint:**  
Try phrasing it so that the positive effects are clearly explained despite the challenge of displacement.

**Would you like to revise this thesis statement one more time, making it one clear, strong sentence?**  
When you’re happy with your thesis, let me know and we’ll move on to the next step!

*Time:* 2025-11-05T09:47:35.292Z

**You:** Automation in factories enhances employment prospects in the long term, it upskills labour and provides new jobs, despite job replacement.

*Time:* 2025-11-05T09:50:59.474Z

**Assistant:** Well done! Your thesis statement is much clearer and stronger now. Here’s a final quick review before moving on:

**Your revised thesis statement:**  
> Automation in factories enhances employment prospects in the long term, it upskills labour and provides new jobs, despite job replacement.

**Feedback:**  
- **Clarity:** Good structure and preview of main points.  
- **Grammar:** Consider joining the ideas more smoothly to avoid a comma splice (two independent clauses joined only by a comma).  
- **Strength:** The meaning is clear and academic.

**Final Tip:**  
If you want an even smoother flow, you could use a linking word like “because” or split into two properly joined clauses. But overall, your statement clearly answers the question and previews your main points!

**Are you satisfied with this thesis statement?**  
If yes, we can move to Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision.

---

**Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**

Please choose *one paragraph* from your essay that you’d like to focus on.  
Let me know which body paragraph you want to revise (e.g., the first paragraph about influencing government, or the second about individual green actions).

Once you've chosen a paragraph, please copy and paste its current topic sentence here.

Then, we’ll review how well it connects to your new thesis, and I’ll help you revise it for clarity and focus.

Which paragraph would you like to work on? And what is its topic sentence?

*Time:* 2025-11-05T09:51:05.611Z

**You:** yes ,we can move ob to step 2

*Time:* 2025-11-05T09:51:39.748Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s continue with **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**.

Please tell me **which body paragraph** you’d like us to work on:
- The **first body paragraph** (about the most important way individuals help—by influencing government)  
**OR**
- The **second body paragraph** (about individual green actions in daily life)

Then, please **copy and paste the first sentence (topic sentence) of that paragraph** here.

Once you do that, I’ll help you revise the topic sentence so it clearly connects to your new thesis statement:  
*"Automation in factories enhances employment prospects in the long term, it upskills labour and provides new jobs, despite job replacement."*

Which paragraph would you like to focus on, and what is the topic sentence?

*Time:* 2025-11-05T09:51:44.217Z

**You:** Before the development of technology, production factories often input and emphasis a pool of cheap labour, so the factories may shift to everywhere and demand the cheap labour which leads to the unstable working environment and low income for the employee. Technology can boost the efficiency and quality off products, push the standard production of the industries. The repetitive process replaced by AI, so the worker can work on other position and more complex work such as controlling the machine. The factories’ producing is becoming more stable at the same time.

*Time:* 2025-11-05T09:53:31.828Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your chosen body paragraph and its topic sentence!

Let’s begin **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision.**

---

**Current topic sentence:**  
> Before the development of technology, production factories often input and emphasis a pool of cheap labour, so the factories may shift to everywhere and demand the cheap labour which leads to the unstable working environment and low income for the employee.

**Feedback on Connection to Thesis:**  
- The sentence focuses on how factories used to rely on cheap labor before technology, but it doesn’t directly state how automation improves employment prospects or leads to upskilling/new jobs.
- To connect **more clearly to your thesis**, the topic sentence should mention how automation changes employment for the better—especially with upskilling, stability, and job opportunities.
- It's a bit long; try to make your topic sentence concise and direct.

---

**Guiding Questions:**  
- Can you revise your topic sentence so it clearly introduces how automation transforms factory work, linking to the thesis’s idea of upskilling and job improvement?
- Would you like to mention both the change from cheap labor and the benefits brought by technology (like stable employment or higher skills)?

**Example frameworks (not to be copied):**  
- "Automation has transformed factory employment by shifting demand from cheap labor to skilled workers, improving job stability and opportunities."
- "The introduction of technology into factories has replaced repetitive tasks, allowing workers to develop new skills and attain more secure positions."

Try revising your topic sentence now, using the feedback and examples above. Once you share your new version, we’ll move on to revising the rest of the paragraph!

Would you like to write your revised topic sentence now?

**Assistant:** That’s completely okay! Writing a clear topic sentence can be a challenge, but it’s a great skill to practice—and it’s important for making your paragraphs focused and effective.

Let’s create a topic sentence for this paragraph together, with the goal of connecting it clearly to your thesis. Your thesis emphasizes:  
**"Automation in factories enhances employment prospects in the long term, it upskills labour and provides new jobs, despite job replacement."**

### Guiding Prompts:
- What is the *main idea* of this paragraph?
    - (Is it about how automation changes factory jobs from low-skill, unstable work to more skilled, stable opportunities?)
- How can you connect this idea to your overall thesis?
    - (Mention “automation” and “upskilling” or “job improvement” so the reader knows how this paragraph supports your main point.)

---

**Try to complete this sentence starter:**

"Automation in factories has changed the nature of employment by _______________."

Or

"By replacing repetitive labour with advanced technology, factories now _______________."

Or

"The introduction of automation in factories has shifted demand away from unskilled workers to _______________."

**You:** The introduction of automation in factories has shifted demand away from unskilled workers to machines.

*Time:* 2025-11-05T10:03:16.406Z

**Assistant:** Great work giving your revised topic sentence! Let’s review it together:

**Your new topic sentence:**  
> The introduction of automation in factories has shifted demand away from unskilled workers to machines.

**Feedback for Improvement:**  
- **Connection to thesis:** This version clearly states that automation changes the type of labor needed. However, it doesn’t yet mention *what happens next* for workers (such as upskilling or improved employment prospects), which is a key part of your thesis.
- **Clarity & Focus:** The sentence is clear and concise, but you could strengthen it by connecting to your thesis ideas—how this shift leads to new opportunities or requires workers to gain new skills.
- **Hint:** Consider including a phrase like “leading to the need for workers to upskill” or “creating opportunities for improved employment.”

---

### Guiding Questions:
- How does this shift from unskilled workers to machines affect employment prospects?
- Does automation only remove jobs, or does it also require workers to develop new skills?

---

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence so it:**
- Clearly introduces the main idea of the paragraph (shift away from unskilled labor due to automation),
- AND hints at the positive effects on employment (such as upskilling and better opportunities)?

**Prompt:**  
Try adding the positive impact to your topic sentence. For example:  
“Automation in factories has shifted demand away from unskilled workers to machines, leading to new opportunities for skilled labour.”

You do NOT have to copy this—use it only as a guide!

Would you like to try editing your topic sentence now, or do you want more help? Once your topic sentence is ready and connects strongly to your thesis, we’ll revise the rest of the paragraph for clarity and coherence!

*Time:* 2025-11-05T10:03:22.917Z

**You:** The introduction of automation in factories has shifted demand away from unskilled workers to machines, which leads to the need for workers to up skill and attain more stable positions.

*Time:* 2025-11-05T10:08:07.572Z

**Assistant:** Excellent revision! Let’s review your updated topic sentence:

> The introduction of automation in factories has shifted demand away from unskilled workers to machines, which leads to the need for workers to upskill and attain more stable positions.

**Strengths:**  
- **Clear connection to thesis:** You now show how automation causes a shift and leads to new opportunities through upskilling and stability.
- **Logical focus:** It previews the main point of your paragraph.
- **Academic tone:** You use confident, clear language.

**Minor suggestions for flow:**  
You might consider smoothing the sentence by removing “to machines” (since “demand” usually refers to workers, not machines). But your meaning is clear—so this is just for fine-tuning!

**Are you satisfied with this topic sentence?**  
If yes, let’s continue to **Step 3: Revising the rest of the paragraph**!

### Step 3: Revising the Content of the Chosen Paragraph

Now, let’s focus on the supporting sentences in this paragraph. Here’s your original version:

> Before the development of technology, production factories often input and emphasis a pool of cheap labour, so the factories may shift to everywhere and demand the cheap labour which leads to the unstable working environment and low income for the employee.

#### Guiding questions:
1. **Does each supporting detail clearly relate to your new topic sentence about upskilling and stability?**
2. **Are your points ordered logically—from what factories were like before automation, to how automation has changed workers’ experiences?**
3. **Can you highlight one or two specific examples of how upskilling and stability have improved for workers due to automation (e.g., safer working conditions, training programs, or new technical roles)?**
4. **Are there any unclear or awkward phrases that could be written more smoothly?**

---

**Suggestions for your revision:**
- Start by clearly describing how factory jobs used to be (unstable, low skill, low pay).
- Then, explain how automation has changed that: workers need new skills, and jobs can be more secure or specialized.
- Finish with an example or explanation—maybe mention how workers now receive training to operate machines or supervise automated processes.

---

**Here’s a possible structure for your paragraph’s content (do not copy, just use as a guide):**
1. Briefly explain what factory work was like before automation.
2. State how automation replaced repetitive tasks but created a demand for skilled workers.
3. Give a specific example or benefit (like training or improved job stability).
4. Connect back to your thesis (why this supports your view).

**You:** Before the development of technology, production factories often input and emphasis a pool of cheap labour, so the factories may shift to everywhere and demand the cheap labour which leads to the unstable working environment and low income for the employee. Technology can boost the efficiency and quality of products, push the standard production of the industries. The repetitive process replaced by AI, so the worker can work on other position and more complex work such as controlling the machine. The factories’ producing is becoming more stable at the same time.

*Time:* 2025-11-05T10:10:50.781Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic effort on revising the supporting sentences in your paragraph! Let’s break down your revised version and see how it connects to your topic sentence and thesis, and then discuss how to make it even clearer and more unified.

**Your revised paragraph:**
> Before the development of technology, production factories often input and emphasis a pool of cheap labour, so the factories may shift to everywhere and demand the cheap labour which leads to the unstable working environment and low income for the employee. Technology can boost the efficiency and quality of products, push the standard production of the industries. The repetitive process replaced by AI, so the worker can work on other position and more complex work such as controlling the machine. The factories’ producing is becoming more stable at the same time.

---

### **Feedback: Clarity, Unity, and Coherence**

**1. Logic and Flow**
- **Good structure**: You move from describing the past situation (cheap, unstable labor) to the positive changes from automation.
- **Clear link**: You explain how technology replaces repetitive jobs and requires workers to control machines.

**2. Alignment & Specifics**
- Some phrases could be smoother (for example: “factories may shift to everywhere,” “input and emphasis a pool of cheap labour”).
- Try to make each sentence clearly support the progression: *past → automation’s changes → benefits for workers*.

**3. Use of Examples**
- You mention “controlling the machine”—this is good! Would you like to add a concrete example, even a simple one (e.g., training programs, or types of new jobs that appeared)?
- You state “producing is more stable”—can you briefly say how this benefits workers? (e.g., more regular hours, better pay, safer conditions)

---

### **Guiding Questions**
- Does each sentence help explain how automation leads to upskilling and job stability?
- Is there a place where you could be more specific?
- Are there phrases that are awkward or unclear, and could be simplified?

---

### **Suggestions for Revision**

- Open with a clear contrast: **what work was like before automation**.
- State **how automation changed roles** (from repetitive work to skilled jobs).
- Highlight **a specific benefit** (e.g., training, stability, or increased income).
- Check for grammar: for example, “input and emphasis” could be “relied on” or “depended on”.

---

#### **You might consider revising sentences like:**
- “Before the development of technology, factories often relied on pools of cheap labour, which led to instability and low wages for employees.”
- “With automation, factories replaced repetitive tasks with machines, so workers moved into more complex roles, such as operating and maintaining technology.”
- “As a result, production is more stable and employees have better opportunities to improve their skills.”

- **Clarity:** The sentence is a bit long and unclear in focus. What is the main idea—global supply chains? Technology making international work easier?
- **Connection to Thesis:** Your thesis highlights that automation “enhances employment prospects...provides new jobs.” How does this topic sentence show the global side of employment improvements?
- **Focus:** Try to introduce the paragraph’s main idea directly: How do technology and automation enable workers and industries to connect globally and open new opportunities?

#### **Guiding questions:**
- What is the main advantage you want to highlight—remote/connected work, global jobs, or benefits for employees?
- How does this continue to show automation’s positive employment impact?

#### **Prompt:**
Try to write a topic sentence like:
- "Technological advancements in automation have created global connections between industries, increasing employment opportunities across borders."
- Or: "Automation in factories has enabled industries and workers to participate in a global supply chain, removing barriers of time and place."

**Would you like to revise your topic sentence now to clearly state the positive, global employment impact of automation and technology?**

**Assistant:** Fantastic! Let’s move on to the next paragraph using the **three-step structured revision process**.

---

# **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**

Let’s begin by identifying and revising the **topic sentence** of this new paragraph.

### **Your paragraph:**
> Some of the people may argued that the automation production and technology development only beneficial for talents and headquarters, it will cause the unemployment of cheap labour. As I mentioned, there are some position need human to carry out. While a country can make use of automation machine, most of the labour may not need to produce themselves, but able to work on different position, which economic condition is link with social state.

### **Find the Topic Sentence**
- The first sentence seems to introduce the main idea:
    > “Some of the people may argued that the automation production and technology development only beneficial for talents and headquarters, it will cause the unemployment of cheap labour.”

This sentence presents a **counterargument**: some people think automation mostly benefits highly skilled workers and causes job loss for low-skilled labor.

---

### **Feedback:**
- **Clarity:** The sentence needs clearer language and grammar.  
- **Connection to Thesis:** It introduces an opposing viewpoint, which is good for critical analysis, but should also lead to your response or explanation (how automation still offers opportunities).
- **Academic Style:** Use present tense (“Some people argue...”) and avoid unnecessary words (“Some of the people may argued…”).

#### **Guiding Questions:**
- Can you clearly state the counterargument *and* signal you will respond to it in this paragraph?
- Does the topic sentence set up a discussion of both sides?

---

### **Prompts/Frameworks:**  
Try sentence starters such as:
- “Some critics argue that automation in production benefits only skilled workers and results in unemployment for low-skilled labour.”
- “Although some argue that automation causes job losses among cheap labour, there are still roles that require human skills.”

You do **not** have to copy—use these as inspiration!

Let me know your revised topic sentence, or if you need a hint or starter!

*Time:* 2025-11-05T11:18:53.121Z

**You:** Some critics argue that the automation production and technology development only benefits talents and headquarters, it will cause the unemployment of cheap labour. As I mentioned, there are still some roles that need human to carry out. While a country can make use of automation machine, most of the labour may not need to produce themselves, but able to work on different position, which economic condition is link with social state.

*Time:* 2025-11-05T11:30:16.242Z

**Assistant:** Great work identifying and revising your topic sentence! Let’s focus on making it clear, concise, and directly connected to your thesis.

---

## **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**

**Your latest topic sentence:**  
> Some critics argue that the automation production and technology development only benefits talents and headquarters, it will cause the unemployment of cheap labour.

### **Feedback:**
- **Clarity:** “automation production” could be phrased as “automation in production” or "factory automation." Avoid comma splices—this is currently two ideas joined with a comma.
- **Academic Style:** Use “Some critics argue” (good!), and present both the criticism and suggest you’ll provide a response/your viewpoint.
- **Connection to Thesis:** The topic sentence should show that, although there are concerns, there are still employment opportunities because of automation (as your thesis states).

---

**Guiding questions:**
- Can you revise the topic sentence to clearly introduce the counterargument **and** hint at your response?
- Does it transition smoothly to what you’ll explain in the paragraph (that automation still offers jobs for humans in new roles)?

---

**Prompt for revision:**  
Try splitting your topic sentence for clarity, or use a phrase to show you’ll respond. For example:
- "Some critics argue that factory automation only benefits skilled workers and results in unemployment for low-skilled labour; however, there are still positions that require human skills."  
*(Do NOT copy—use this as inspiration!)*

---

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now?**
Aim for a clear sentence that introduces the opposing viewpoint and leads to your response (that automation still leaves opportunities for labour).

When you’re satisfied, we’ll move to **Step 3: Revising supporting sentences in this paragraph**.

---

## **Step 3: Revising Supporting Sentences**

Here’s your current supporting content:
> As I mentioned, there are still some roles that need human to carry out. While a country can make use of automation machine, most of the labour may not need to produce themselves, but able to work on different position, which economic condition is link with social state.

### **Guiding questions for revision:**
- Does each sentence directly respond to the counterargument and support your thesis (automation still creates work for humans)?
- Are you clear about what types of jobs humans do? Can you give a specific or brief example (like oversight, maintenance, or teamwork roles)?
- Can your sentences be made smoother with clearer grammar and transitions?

---

**Suggested approach:**
- Clarify: What kinds of roles still need humans, despite automation?
- If possible, offer a brief example of a typical job humans might do (e.g., supervising machines, quality checking, maintaining equipment).
- Connect economic and social benefit to the availability of these roles.

---

**Would you like to try revising one or more supporting sentences in this paragraph?**
Focus on clarity, unity, and making each point directly support your topic sentence and thesis.

For example, you might reword:
- “There are still some roles that require human involvement, such as maintaining or supervising automated equipment.”
- “As automation increases, workers may shift from manual production to positions that use their skills in other ways.”

*(Do not copy—use these to guide your thinking!)*

---

Share your revised supporting sentences when you're ready, or ask for more hints or prompts. I’ll help polish the paragraph for clarity and coherence and confirm when it's ready!

**You’re doing excellent work at presenting both sides and strengthening your analysis—keep going!**

*Time:* 2025-11-05T11:30:29.936Z

**You:** Some critics argue that the automation production and technology development only benefits talents and headquarters, it will cause the unemployment of cheap labour. As I mentioned, there are still some roles that need human to carry out, which still provide employment such as maintenance and products designing. The resourses and manspower inputed before can be use on improve employees' skills, leading low-skilled labour become high-skilled labour.

*Time:* 2025-11-05T11:43:59.983Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic work! Your revised paragraph clearly presents a counterargument, responds to it, and offers specific supporting details. Let’s now polish your topic sentence and supporting sentences for **clarity, unity, and coherence.**

---

**Step 2: Topic Sentence Review**

> Some critics argue that the automation production and technology development only benefits talents and headquarters, it will cause the unemployment of cheap labour.

**Strengths:**
- You present the opposing viewpoint using academic language ("Some critics argue...").
- The sentence sets up your response well.

**Areas to Improve:**
- Adjust the wording for clarity: “automation production” should be “automation in production” or “factory automation.”
- Separate into two sentences or use a linking word to avoid a run-on (comma splice).
- Make sure it smoothly transitions to your idea.

**Suggestion for structure (DO NOT copy!):**
- "Some critics argue that automation in factories only benefits highly skilled workers and headquarters, causing unemployment among low-skilled labour; however, some roles still require human workers."

Would you like to edit your topic sentence one more time for clarity?  
For example, use a semi-colon or a clear connecting word (“however,” “yet,” “nevertheless”).

---

**Step 3: Supporting Sentences Review**

> As I mentioned, there are still some roles that need human to carry out, which still provide employment such as maintenance and products designing. The resourses and manspower inputed before can be use on improve employees' skills, leading low-skilled labour become high-skilled labour.

**Strengths:**
- You state that some jobs still need humans (“maintenance and products designing”).
- You suggest that previous resources can be used for upskilling.
- You explain how low-skilled labour can become high-skilled.

**Areas to Focus:**
- Clarify grammar and phrasing (“inputed before,” “can be use on improve”).
- Use your own words but clarify the logic: How do resources and manpower translate into training/upskilling?
- Keep the sentences connected to the response to the counterargument.

---

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does each detail directly answer the worry about unemployment? Does it show specific jobs or benefits for workers?
- Can you explain, with a brief phrase, how low-skilled workers might receive training or move into roles like maintenance or design?
- Are there words or phrases that could be simplified for clarity?

---

**Encouragement:**
You might try dividing one complex idea into two short sentences, or clarify with a transition (“For example,” “Furthermore,” etc.).

You’re doing very well!  
Would you like to:
- Revise one or two sentences for clarity?
- Add a brief example of a job or training program for workers?
- Let me know if you’re satisfied or need more guidance!

**Summary:**
Your paragraph structure shows critical analysis and a reasoned response to the counterargument.  
Each sentence should:
- Present the opposing view,
- Respond with specific evidence/examples,
- Stay focused on how automation can continue to provide jobs through upskilling or human-required tasks.

**You:** i've done this paragraph improvement,lets move on to last paragrath,the conclusion

*Time:* 2025-11-05T11:49:55.603Z

**Assistant:** Wonderful progress! Let’s apply the **three-step revision process** to your **conclusion paragraph**. Here’s what we’ll do:

1. **Review the thesis statement** (already done).
2. **Revise the topic sentence of your conclusion** (the first sentence of the last paragraph).
3. **Revise the supporting/concluding sentences for clarity, unity, and coherence.**

---

### **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision (Conclusion)**

**Please copy your current conclusion paragraph here.**  
Let’s identify the topic sentence (usually the first sentence in the conclusion) and check how well it **restates your thesis** and signals a wrap-up.

#### Your original conclusion:
> In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**However, your essay for automation should have a conclusion like:**
> In conclusion, automation in factories enhances employment prospects, despite job replacement, by upskilling labour and creating new opportunities.

(Focus on your essay’s main themes: automation, employment prospects, upskilling, new jobs.)

---

### **Guiding Questions for Topic Sentence (Conclusion):**
- Does your first sentence directly **summarize your thesis** and main argument?
- Is the language confident and academic?  
- Does it signal a summary or wrap-up — ("In conclusion, ...," "Overall, ...," etc.)

---

#### **Prompt for Revision:**
Try to write a topic sentence for your conclusion that **restates your thesis** clearly and confidently, summarizing your main position on automation and employment.

**Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now?**  
You might start with: “In conclusion, [main idea restated]...”  
*Do NOT copy, but use as inspiration!*

---

Once you share your revised topic sentence, we’ll review the rest of the conclusion and polish it for clarity and unity!

---

Let me know your topic sentence for the conclusion, or if you want a hint or sentence starter.

## **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision (Conclusion)**

**Your current topic sentence:**  
> Therefore, the development of automation push the improvement of works and produce global market network, which enhance the global employment prospects.

### **Feedback:**
- **Clarity:** Some phrases (“push the improvement of works”) are unclear. The idea is good—automation improves jobs and creates global market networks.
- **Academic Language:** Use present tense (“pushes,” “produces”) and formal tone.
- **Connection to Thesis:** It should directly summarize your main argument (how automation enhances global employment prospects through upskilling and global opportunities).

---

### **Guiding Questions:**
- Does your topic sentence summarize your thesis (“automation in factories enhances employment prospects by upskilling workers and creating global opportunities”)?
- Is the wording clear and direct?
- Would you like to mention both main reasons you addressed: upskilling/stable jobs, and global collaboration/job opportunities?

*Time:* 2025-11-05T12:06:16.363Z

**You:** Automation in factories enhances employment prospects in the long term, it upskills labour and provides new jobs, despite job replacement.

The introduction of automation in factories has shifted demand away from unskilled workers to machines, which leads to the need for workers to up skill and attain more stable positions. Before the development of technology, production factories often relied on pools of cheap labour, requiring lowering the costs, which caused the bad working conditions and low wages for employees. Technology can boost the efficiency and quality of products, push the standard production. Then, the repetitive process replaced by AI, the workers can work in other positions and more complex work such as controlling the machine and checking the products, it provides opportunities to labour upskill themselves for other positions. As a result, the production process is becoming more stable that labour can have safer working environment and more regular hours at the same time.

Automation in factories has enabled idustries and employees to form a global network without barriers of time and place, enhancing more global collaboration, which also creates more job opportunities. These global networks support remote communication and work. For example, employees can apply and join various positions through automated communication platforms. So, it can attract more talents around the world and allow exchange the market information between different industries, and access to jobs worldwide.

Some critics argue that the automation in production and technology development only benefits talents and headquarters, it will cause unemployment of cheap labour. However, there are still some roles that humans need to carry out, which still provide employment such as maintenance and products designing. The resources and manpower imputed before can be trained to improve employees’ skills but not only low-ended process, leading low-skilled labour become high-skilled labour.

In conclusion, the development of automation pushes the improvement of jobs and creates global market network, which upgrades employment prospects worldwide. Also, automation reduces issues such as unfair pay and excessive working hours that affected cheap labour in the past, because automation means factories no longer rely on large pools of cheap labour. Under the advancement of automation, it is hoped that workers’ quality and treatment will improve gradually, so that sweatshop conditions are eliminated, and global trade will benefit everyone.
lets have final checking and review

*Time:* 2025-11-05T12:20:30.121Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let’s do a **final check and review** using the structured criteria from your course rubric, focusing on clarity, cohesion, academic tone, vocabulary, and grammar. I’ll highlight strengths, pinpoint areas to polish, and offer **brief, targeted suggestions**—but I won’t rewrite full sentences or paragraphs.

---

## 1. **Thesis Statement**

**Your thesis:**  
> Automation in factories enhances employment prospects in the long term, it upskills labour and provides new jobs, despite job replacement.

**Strengths:**  
- Clearly states your position and previews key points: upskilling, new jobs, long-term effects.

**Areas to polish:**  
- **Grammar:** This is a comma splice (two independent clauses joined by a comma). You could revise by using a connector:  
  *Suggestion:* “Automation in factories enhances employment prospects in the long term because it upskills labour and provides new jobs, despite job replacement.”  
  *(Try revising by joining or restructuring for academic flow!)*

---

## 2. **Body Paragraphs**

### **First Body Paragraph**

**Strengths:**  
- Topic sentence is clear and connected to the thesis.
- You describe the shift from cheap labour to skilled roles and the impact on working conditions.

**Areas to polish:**  
- **Vocabulary:** "push the standard production" is awkward. Consider “improves production standards.”
- **Grammar:** “it provides opportunities to labour upskill themselves for other positions” is a bit clunky—can you rephrase for conciseness?
- **Coherence:** Watch the transition: “Then, the repetitive process replaced by AI, the workers can work in other positions...” Consider breaking into two sentences, or adding “As a result,” for flow.

**Quick prompts for improvement:**  
- Are your transitions between old conditions and new ones clear?
- Does every sentence specifically support your point about upskilling and stability?

### **Second Body Paragraph**

**Strengths:**  
- You introduce global networks and remote communication as benefits.
- Good use of examples ("employees can apply and join various positions...").

**Areas to polish:**  
- **Spelling:** “idustries” → “industries.”
- **Grammar:** "allow exchange the market information" → "allow exchange of market information."
- **Clarity:** “So, it can attract more talents around the world and allow exchange the market information between different industries, and access to jobs worldwide.” Consider splitting into shorter sentences for clarity.

**Quick prompts:**  
- Does each sentence build a clear connection between automation and global employment opportunities?
- Can you specify how remote work benefits employees a bit more?

### **Third Body Paragraph**

**Strengths:**  
- Good use of counterargument and response structure.
- You provide examples of roles for humans and emphasize upskilling.

**Areas to polish:**  
- **Grammar:** “imputed before can be trained” → maybe “previous resources and manpower can be used for training.”
- **Clarity:** “low-ended process” is unclear. Consider “routine tasks.”
- **Academic tone:** “leading low-skilled labour become high-skilled labour” → “helping low-skilled labour to become high-skilled.”

**Quick prompts:**  
- Are you linking your rebuttal clearly to your thesis, showing how automation still supports human employment?
- Could you give one more specific, clear example of human-required jobs for illustration?

---

## 3. **Conclusion**

**Strengths:**  
- You restate and summarize your main points well.
- The future outlook and hope for improved conditions is clear and optimistic.

**Areas to polish:**  
- **Word choice:** “creates global market network” → “creates global market networks.”
- **Grammar:** “so that sweatshop conditions are eliminated, and global trade will benefit everyone.” Consider making this a confident final statement, perhaps split for impact.
- “workers’ quality and treatment will improve gradually, so that sweatshop conditions are eliminated” is slightly awkward—try reordering for flow.

**Quick prompts:**  
- Is your closing sentence clear and powerful?
- Do all points link directly back to the thesis and enhance your main argument?

---

## 4. **Rubric Review Checklist**

- **Content & Ideas:** Your essay is relevant, develops a clear argument, uses examples, and shows critical awareness. To score higher, focus on deepening analysis, being specific, and showing how each point ties to employment prospects.
- **Organisation & Logic:** Paragraphs are clear and generally well structured. Make transitions strong and ensure each idea follows logically.
- **Vocabulary:** Use more topic-specific terms (“automation,” “upskilling,” “global networks,” “remote collaboration,” “downsizing,” “retraining”).
- **Grammar/Sentence Structure:** Watch for comma splices, subject-verb agreement, and awkward phrasing. Aim for confident, academic tone. Vary sentence length for flow.

---

## **Final Quick Editing Checklist**
- Check for typos (“idustries,” “imputed,” “disapeared”) and fix them.
- Eliminate run-on sentences by using periods or linking words (“and,” “because,” “as a result”).
- Smooth transitions between ideas (“As a result,” “Furthermore,” “For example”).
- Double-check that every paragraph’s topic sentence directly supports the thesis.

---

### **Would you like to polish one or two target sentences now?**
For example:
- Fix the thesis statement to eliminate the comma splice.
- Clarify any sentence that feels awkward or unclear.

---

**Overall, your essay is well structured, addresses the question directly, and uses critical thinking—excellent progress!**

Keep refining using these hints and prompts, and you’ll score highly in all rubric areas.

**Would you like me to focus on one target sentence for a final edit, or are you ready to submit?**

**Congratulations on your hard work and improvement!**
Let me know if you have further questions or want detailed feedback on any specific part.
