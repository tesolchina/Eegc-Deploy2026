            ## Contribution Analysis

            Based on the training assessment report and chat history you shared, here is a concise summary of key points and next steps tailored to support improvement:

---

### Summary of Key Findings

- **Essay revision attempts were minimal or missing:** The student did not submit a concrete revised thesis, topic sentence, or paragraph despite multiple prompts. Instead, placeholders and “bla bla bla” were used.
- **Limited engagement in chat:** The student’s responses were brief, non-substantive, and dismissive, significantly limiting productive revision cycles.
- **AI assistant provided detailed, scaffolded guidance:** Clear, stepwise prompts focused on thesis revision, topic sentence refinement, and paragraph rewriting to model a solid revision workflow.
- **Lack of iterative revision:** No actual draft revisions nor critical evaluations of AI feedback were given by the student.
- **Persistent grammar and vocabulary issues:** The original errors remained unaddressed in the revised essay draft.

---

### Recommendations for the Student

1. **Submit concrete revised texts when requested**
   - Paste the exact revised thesis sentence in the chat first, clearly previewing two main points.
   - Then, post a revised topic sentence for a chosen paragraph.
   - Next, submit the full revised paragraph for targeted feedback.
   - Avoid placeholders or skipping steps.

2. **Engage actively and critically with AI feedback**
   - Respond with acceptance, requested clarifications, or reasoned queries.
   - Try integrating suggested vocabulary and grammar improvements.
   - Use AI prompts to guide your revision rather than circumvent them.

3. **Focus on sentence-level edits**
   - Fix basic grammatical errors to improve clarity.
   - Use more precise and academic vocabulary (e.g., “policy change,” “mobilize citizens,” “aggregate consumer demand”).
   - Eliminate vague or filler expressions.

4. **Follow a stepwise iterative process**
   - Revise thesis → revise topic sentence → revise paragraph → repeat for other paragraphs.
   - Share each step in the chat for feedback before moving on.
   - Aim for at least 2–3 revision cycles per element to deepen learning.

---

### Recommendations for Instructor

- Require resubmission with explicit inclusion of a revised thesis and at least one fully revised body paragraph.
- Implement short, staged checkpoints to ensure student engagement:  
  **Checkpoint 1:** Submit revised thesis  
  **Checkpoint 2:** Submit revised topic sentence for paragraph 1  
  **Checkpoint 3:** Submit revised paragraph 1  
- Monitor student input in chat for substantive engagement and provide motivational prompts or scaffolds as needed.
- Consider additional support sessions focused on grammar and vocabulary enhancement.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 19/25 - The essay takes a clear, balanced stance and uses relevant examples (e.g., “if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy”), but ideas are superficial and repetitive rather than deeply developed.
- Organization: 18/25 - Standard essay structure (introduction, two body paragraphs, conclusion) with logical progression, but paragraph transitions and paragraph focus are weak and sometimes redundant.
- Vocabulary: 17/25 - Vocabulary is adequate and appropriate to the topic but limited and repetitive (frequent use of simple phrases like “people,” “do green things,” “this is problem”).
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 16/25 - Noticeable errors that affect clarity (examples: “the government maybe just listen a little,” “so nothing happen,” “it not really enough”), and many sentences are simple or awkwardly phrased.
- **Original Essay Total: 70/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 15/25 - The revised file does not contain a substantive revised thesis or revised topic sentences; it contains placeholders (“bla bla bla ... ...(revised thesis statement here)”) so the planned improvements were not implemented. Remaining content mirrors the original but with gaps.
- Organization: 15/25 - The structure is interrupted by placeholders and lacks the promised clearer topic/thesis linkage; paragraph roles are not revised as requested.
- Vocabulary: 14/25 - Placeholders and repeated informal tokens (“bla bla bla …”) reduce lexical quality; no demonstrated expansion of vocabulary or more precise terminology.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 15/25 - Original grammatical errors persist in the unchanged paragraphs; placeholders and informal strings further degrade readability.
- **Revised Essay Total: 59/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -11 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None substantial — the revised submission did not include the requested concrete revisions. The body paragraphs remain largely the same as in the original.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Revise and present a clear, concise thesis that previews the two main points (influencing government and individual/consumer actions).
  - Produce clearer, more precise topic sentences that connect explicitly to the revised thesis (avoid absolutes like “the most important” if thesis is partial).
  - Edit sentence-level grammar and phrasing to remove errors (e.g., “nothing happen” → “nothing happens”; “maybe just listen” → “may only partially listen”).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 8** (assistant and student turns combined)
- **Conversation Quality:** The AI assistant provided detailed, scaffolded guidance and repeated prompts asking the student to paste a revised thesis and topic sentence. The student responded with brief, non-substantive replies (“let's pretend…,” “bla bla bla…”) and did not provide the requested revisions, so the interaction lacked the critical back-and-forth needed for effective revision.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 - The chat shows multiple assistant messages with guidance, but the student’s contributions are minimal and largely dismissive (“let's pretend we have revised…”, “bla bla bla…”). The exchange count (8 turns) is low and not deeply substantive from the student’s side.
  - Evidence: Student replies such as “let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on bla bla bla...” and “let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on bla bla bla…”.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - The student did not evaluate, accept, or reject AI suggestions with evidence-based reasons. They repeatedly deferred actual revision work instead of engaging critically.
  - Evidence: Assistant asked for a pasted revised thesis multiple times; the student never provided one despite the assistant’s specific requests.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - There is no clear iterative revision cycle visible. The assistant requested revisions and gave concrete next steps; the student did not provide revised drafts to iterate on.
  - Evidence: Assistant guidance: “Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now…?” — no revised thesis was pasted in the chat.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 6/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student’s original essay shows an ability to form a coherent, balanced position on the prompt with relevant examples (e.g., public protests, consumer choices).
- The AI assistant provided strong, explicit scaffolding and concrete revision guidance (thesis checklist, topic-sentence hints, verbs/phrases to use).
- The student shows willingness to follow a guided process (the student repeatedly signaled readiness to “move on”), indicating some engagement with the task structure.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- The student must produce the actual revisions requested: a revised thesis statement, revised topic sentence(s), and a revised body paragraph to demonstrate learning and permit iteration.
- Increase active engagement with the AI: paste draft revisions, respond to feedback with counter-arguments or acceptance reasons, and request specific follow-ups when uncertain.
- Address sentence-level errors and vocabulary limits in editing passes: correct grammatical mistakes and use more precise, topic-specific language (e.g., “policy change,” “aggregate consumer demand,” “regulatory action”).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student did not paste the revised thesis or specify the chosen paragraph for revision when asked; limited contextual input prevented progress.
  - Evidence: Repeated assistant prompts asking for the revised thesis and paragraph; student replied with “pretend” statements instead of providing text.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The student did not demonstrate a revision plan or micro-steps (e.g., paste new thesis, then topic sentence, then paragraph edits) despite assistant guidance.
  - Evidence: No staged submissions of revised pieces in chat.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student did not evaluate or justify acceptance/rejection of AI suggestions.
  - Evidence: No critiques or selective acceptance of suggested phrasing or structure appear in the chat.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - No actual edits were submitted in the chat; only the original and a placeholder revised essay were provided.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Paste concrete revisions in the chat when requested: start by posting a one-sentence revised thesis that clearly previews two main points. Example model: “I partly agree that individual actions matter because citizens can pressure governments to adopt strong climate policy and consumer choices can shift corporate behavior, although individual actions alone are insufficient without systemic change.”
2. Use the assistant’s scaffolding iteratively: paste a revised thesis, accept focused feedback, then post a revised topic sentence, then a revised full paragraph. Aim for 2–3 revision cycles per element.
3. Attend to sentence-level editing: run a quick grammar pass to fix errors like subject-verb agreement and verb tense (“nothing happen” → “nothing happens”) and replace informal placeholders (“bla bla”) with concrete content.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student did not complete the core tasks required by the assignment: no concrete revised thesis, topic sentence, or revised body paragraph were submitted despite multiple prompts. The uploaded “revised essay” contains placeholders rather than substantive revisions.
- Recommend requiring the student to resubmit with an explicit, revised thesis and at least one fully revised body paragraph (including a revised topic sentence) so the AI-assisted revision process can be properly assessed and credited.
- If this is part of graded coursework, consider allowing a short revision window with stepwise checkpoints (thesis first; topic sentence second; paragraph third) to ensure engagement and demonstrate iterative revision.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. bla bla bla ... ...(revised thesis statement here)

revised topic sentence bla bla bla …When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. revise the rest of body paragraph #1 ...

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-20T13:33:35.426Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-20T13:35:31.902Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for sharing your thesis:  
"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Step 1 — Feedback on clarity, strength, and focus
- Clarity: Your meaning is clear: you take a balanced position. But the sentence is long and a bit repetitive (e.g., “I partly agree” + “I also think”). Shortening and tightening will help the reader quickly see your stance.
- Strength: The phrase “I partly agree” is fine, but hedging like “I also think” and “while less impactful” weakens the claim. Use more confident language that still expresses nuance (e.g., “partially” or “to some extent” is OK, but avoid unnecessary fillers).
- Focus: The thesis does not preview the main points clearly. The essay should signal the two or three reasons you will discuss (for example: political influence, consumer pressure, and the limits of individual action). A clear preview helps organisation and guides the reader.

What to include in a stronger thesis (checklist)
- Directly answer the question (extent of agreement/disagreement).
- Preview the main points or structure (e.g., how individuals can influence policy; how consumer choices affect corporations; why individual actions alone are insufficient).
- Use confident, precise language and avoid filler phrases.

Concrete revision guidance (not a full rewrite)
- Replace repetitive clauses with one concise claim of partial agreement.
- Add a brief preview: two or three specific points you will discuss (mention “influencing government” and “consumer/personal choices,” and optionally “limitations”).
- Use verbs like “contribute,” “pressure,” “influence,” “remain limited,” rather than vague words like “maybe” or “very important.”

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using those suggestions? Paste your revised version here, and I will give focused feedback. We’ll only move on to the topic sentence after you’re happy with the revised thesis.

*Time:* 2025-11-20T13:35:52.507Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on                                                                          bla bla bla...

*Time:* 2025-11-20T13:43:32.625Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s move to Step 2.

First, please paste your revised thesis statement here (even if we’re “pretending” it’s revised). I need it to check how well the topic sentence will connect.

Next, tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (Paragraph 1 about influencing government, or Paragraph 2 about personal lifestyle/consumer choices). Then paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence.

Quick guidance so you can choose:

- If you pick Paragraph 1 (current topic sentence: “The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”)
  - Tips: avoid absolute language like “the most important” if your thesis is a partial-agreement claim. Use wording that shows it’s a significant contribution but not the only one (e.g., “one important way” or “a key way”).
  - Make the link to the thesis explicit: show how citizen action leads to policy change (voting, protests, petitions) and note limits briefly if you will discuss them later.
  - Strong verbs: influence, pressure, elect, advocate, mobilize.
  - Useful addition: preview the specific supports you will use (e.g., protest, voting, lobbying).

- If you pick Paragraph 2 (current topic sentence: “On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.”)
  - Tips: clarify how these small actions matter (aggregate impact, social norms, market signals) and connect them to the thesis by acknowledging scale/limitations.
  - Make the paragraph’s focus clear: are you arguing these actions primarily change behavior, send market signals, or simply model sustainable habits?
  - Strong verbs: encourage, reduce, signal, aggregate, influence demand.

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now? Paste your revised thesis and the chosen topic sentence, and I’ll give focused feedback and short hints for improving it further.

*Time:* 2025-11-20T13:43:55.515Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on                                      bla bla bla…

*Time:* 2025-11-20T13:55:00.437Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — you’re doing well directing the process. Before we move on, I need two things from you so we can follow the three-step plan correctly.

1) Please paste your revised thesis statement (the one you “pretend” you revised). I can’t move to paragraph work until you confirm you’re happy with the revised thesis. Quick reminders for a strong thesis:
- State your position clearly (extent of agreement) without excess hedging.
- Preview the main points (e.g., political influence, consumer pressure, limits of individual action).
- Use confident, precise verbs (contribute, influence, remain limited).

2) Tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (Paragraph 1: influencing government, or Paragraph 2: personal/consumer choices). Then paste the topic sentence you want to revise (the current or your “pretend” revision).

If you’d like a very short checklist to guide your topic-sentence revision now:
- Begin by signalling the paragraph’s role in proving your thesis (words/phrases like “one important way,” “a significant contribution,” or “another important channel” are useful — avoid absolute terms like “the most important” if your thesis is partial).
- Mention the specific mechanism (e.g., vote, protest, petitions; or aggregate consumer demand, social norms).
- If helpful, add a short clause that connects to limits (only if you plan to discuss limits later).

Would you like to paste your revised thesis and pick a paragraph now?

*Time:* 2025-11-20T13:55:16.131Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1

bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-11-20T14:00:56.034Z

**Assistant:** Great — I can help revise paragraph #1, but first we must finish Step 1 (thesis revision). I can’t move on until you paste your revised thesis and confirm you’re happy with it.

Quick checklist for the thesis you should paste now:
- State your position clearly (how far you agree).
- Preview the main points (e.g., influencing government; consumer pressure; limits of individual action).
- Use confident, precise language (no fillers).

Once you paste the revised thesis and confirm it’s final, paste the current topic sentence you want to use for paragraph #1 (or tell me you want to revise the original: “The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”). Also paste the full paragraph 1 so I can help revise the rest.

Hints to revise the paragraph-1 topic sentence (do not write it for you — use these to craft it):
- Avoid absolute words like “the most important” if your thesis is partial — use phrasing such as “one important way,” “a key way,” or “an effective way.”
- Start by signalling the paragraph’s role in supporting the thesis (phrases: “One important way,” “A key contribution,” “Citizens often influence…”).
- Name the mechanism quickly (vote, protest, petitions, lobbying, public pressure).
- Add a brief linking idea about outcome (policy change, regulation, investment) if you plan to show cause-effect.

Useful verbs/phrases you can use in your revised topic sentence:
- influence/press/pressure/elect/advocate/mobilize
- lead to/push for/encourage/prompt/shape policy
- through voting, protests, petitions, consumer campaigns

Would you like to paste your revised thesis now? After that, try writing a new topic sentence for paragraph 1 using the hints above and paste the full paragraph. I’ll give focused feedback and guide you to revise the rest.
