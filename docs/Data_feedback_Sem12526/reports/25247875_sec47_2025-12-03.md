            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your detailed rewritten essay and thesis. Your thesis sentence now clearly states a firm, positive stance and previews three strong reasons, which is excellent for academic clarity and focus.

Here are some small suggestions to make your thesis even more concise and impactful:

- Consider trimming phrases like “in the long term” or “ultimately,” since they overlap in meaning.
- You might strengthen the conditional aspect on education and policy by folding it directly into the thesis, e.g.:  
  “Although automation causes short-term job displacement, it will enhance global employment prospects if supported by proactive education and policies because it creates more diverse and higher-skilled jobs, drives economic growth, and increases demand for human oversight and innovation.”  
- This way, the condition does not feel like an afterthought and highlights that your argument depends on policy actions.

If you are satisfied with your thesis as it stands, we can proceed to Step 2: selecting one body paragraph for revision. You can either choose a paragraph you feel needs strengthening, or I can recommend one based on earlier chat content.

Please let me know how you’d like to continue!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The essay presents a relevant viewpoint on climate change and individual vs. government roles, but ideas are only partially developed and sometimes repetitive.
- Organization: 17/25 - Basic paragraph structure is present (intro, body, conclusion) but logical flow and transitions are weak and some points are redundant.
- Vocabulary: 16/25 - Vocabulary is simple and often informal; some topic-related terms appear but are used imprecisely.
- Grammar: 15/25 - Frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing reduce clarity (e.g., "the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well.").
- **Original Essay Total: 66/100**

Evidence (original): the sentence above shows grammar and clarity problems; topic development examples are simple and repetitive (“recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive”).

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 24/25 - Clear, well-focused argument on automation and employment. The thesis previews three concrete reasons and the essay develops them with relevant claims and examples (e.g., new job categories, productivity-driven growth, dependence on human oversight).
- Organization: 24/25 - Strong structure with logical progression: concession to short-term harms, then detailed long-term benefits, followed by policy condition and conclusion.
- Vocabulary: 23/25 - Wide range of precise, topic-specific vocabulary (e.g., "productivity," "robot maintainers," "data scientists," "AI ethicists") and professional tone.
- Grammar: 23/25 - High overall accuracy and use of complex sentences; a few minor phrasing choices could be tightened but nothing that seriously impedes understanding.
- **Revised Essay Total: 94/100**

Evidence (revised): thesis sentence — "Although automation causes short-term job displacement, it will ultimately enhance global employment prospects because it creates more diverse and higher-skilled jobs, drives broader economic growth through increased productivity, and continues to depend on human expertise for oversight, maintenance, and innovation." Topic sentence example — "While automation undeniably eliminates some routine jobs in the short term, historical evidence shows that technological change has always led to net job creation over time."

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +28 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis clarity and focus: the revised thesis directly answers the prompt and previews three analytical strands.
  - Organization and development: paragraphs follow a logical order (short-term impact → new job creation → economic mechanisms → human dependence → policy conditions → conclusion).
  - Tone, vocabulary, and grammatical accuracy: the revised essay uses more precise terminology and formal academic register.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Use of concrete data or specific citations (the essay references the World Economic Forum and McKinsey but does not provide specific figures or dates); adding a precise statistic would strengthen claims.
  - Explicit handling of distributional effects and equity (which groups are most harmed during transition) could be elaborated.
  - The conditional role of policy/education could be integrated into the thesis more explicitly (the thesis mentions it but it could be made a clearer premise of the argument).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9** (assistant messages and student replies across the thread)
- **Conversation Quality:** Focused, iterative exchanges centered on thesis revision and paragraph structure. The assistant provided templates and targeted feedback; the student responded with multiple rewrites and eventually pasted a full revised essay.

Representative evidence:
- Assistant prompt (guidance): "A strong thesis must (1) clearly answer the question... (2) preview the main points..."
- Student revised thesis in chat: "Although automation causes short-term job displacement, it will ultimately enhance global employment prospects because it creates more diverse and higher-skilled jobs, drives broader economic growth through increased productivity, and continues to depend on human expertise for oversight, maintenance, and innovation."
- Student produced multiple rewrites (at least two clear iterations of the thesis and a final full essay paste).

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Developing. Justification: The chat includes 9 exchanges and thoughtful, focused interaction about thesis and paragraph structure. However, the depth is moderate (not the extensive 15+ exchange level described for "Excellent").
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 - Developing. Justification: The student accepted and applied much of the AI guidance (rewrote the thesis and essay) but shows limited evidence of critically challenging or selectively rejecting AI suggestions. Most moves were receptive rather than evaluative.
- **Refining Process**: 4/5 - Proficient. Justification: Multiple meaningful revision cycles are visible — the student rewrote the thesis several times and produced a fully revised essay after iterative feedback. The process shows clear improvement and responsiveness to feedback.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 10/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear adoption of feedback: Student followed assistant's templates and guidance to produce a focused, strong thesis and an organized essay (evidence: final thesis and the structured paragraphs).
- Improved academic tone and vocabulary: Revised essay uses discipline-appropriate terms and formal phrasing ("productivity," "human-centered industries," "retraining programs").
- Iterative revision: Multiple rewrites in the chat show the student can engage in an iterative editing process and implement suggestions.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Evidence and specificity: Add concrete statistics, dates, or brief citations to support claims (e.g., a specific WEF or McKinsey projection).
- Critical engagement with AI: Ask follow-up questions or challenge suggestions when they don’t fit your intended emphasis (e.g., if you want to foreground policy concerns, instruct the AI to prioritize that).
- Consistency of revision target: The original essay and revised essay address different topics (original: climate change; revised: automation). Future revisions should ensure the same essay/document is being edited unless a topic change is intended and approved.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided a draft and a clear writing question; chat shows the student supplied a rewrite and signaled goals.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student used the assistant's three-step revision plan (thesis → paragraph revision → full draft) and followed through.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement to Developing - The student accepted most suggestions and implemented them; more explicit justification for accepting/rejecting options would strengthen skills.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The student demonstrated ability to incorporate AI feedback and perform independent rewriting (the final essay shows significant autonomous drafting).

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Strengthen evidence: When the AI suggests citing reports, add a specific statistic or short example (e.g., "McKinsey estimates X million jobs lost/gained by 2030") to substantiate claims.
2. Increase critical engagement: When an AI gives multiple options, explicitly state which you prefer and why — this will develop evaluative skills and lead to more targeted revisions.
3. Focus revisions on the original prompt: Ensure that revisions track the same essay (topic and assignment) unless a topic change is intentional; if changing topic, note the reason for instructor clarity.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student demonstrated clear improvement in argument clarity, organization, and register. However, please note the original essay submitted for comparison discusses climate change while the revised essay addresses automation — this may reflect a change in assignment/topic or the student working on a different draft. Clarify whether the student was expected to revise the same original essay or a different one.
- The student shows strong willingness to iterate and apply feedback; encourage deeper critical engagement with AI suggestions and more use of concrete data in supporting claims.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
In the modern era, automation—most visibly represented by artificial intelligence—is reshaping every aspect of work and daily life. The central question is whether this transformation will ultimately improve or damage global employment prospects in the long term. Although automation causes short-term job displacement, it will ultimately enhance global employment prospects because it creates more diverse and higher-skilled jobs, drives broader economic growth through increased productivity, and continues to depend on human expertise for oversight, maintenance, and innovation. While automation undeniably eliminates some routine jobs in the short term, historical evidence shows that technological change has always led to net job creation over time. Factory workers, drivers, and clerical staff are increasingly being replaced by machines that perform repetitive tasks faster and with fewer errors. This transition can cause temporary unemployment and hardship. However, past revolutions—from steam engines to computers—followed the same pattern: initial disruption followed by the emergence of far more jobs than were lost. More importantly, automation generates entirely new categories of higher-skilled and better-paid employment that did not exist before. When machines handle predictable tasks, human workers shift to roles requiring creativity, complex problem-solving, and interpersonal skills. The rise of automation has already created demand for robot maintainers, software developers, data scientists, AI ethicists, and advanced healthcare professionals. Reports from the World Economic Forum and McKinsey Global Institute predict that by 2030, tens of millions of new jobs will appear in green technologies, digital services, and human-centered industries—far outnumbering the jobs displaced. Automation also fuels overall economic growth by dramatically raising productivity and lowering costs, which expands the total number of jobs in the economy. Companies that automate become more competitive, increase profits, and expand into new markets, requiring more employees in research, marketing, management, and customer service. At the same time, lower production costs increase consumers’ purchasing power, boosting demand in retail, entertainment, education, and hospitality sectors. A larger economy naturally supports more employment for everyone. Finally, even the most advanced automated systems remain heavily dependent on human workers for design, monitoring, repair, and decision-making in unpredictable situations. Machines break down, software needs updating, and unexpected problems arise that only experienced technicians and engineers can solve. From maintaining robotic assembly lines to training AI models and ensuring ethical outcomes, human expertise remains indispensable. Of course, these benefits will only materialize fully if governments and educators act proactively. Strong investment in retraining programs, lifelong learning, and social safety nets is essential to help workers move smoothly into new roles and prevent inequality from widening. In conclusion, despite short-term challenges, automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects by shifting human labor toward higher-value work, accelerating economic growth, and preserving the irreplaceable role of people in overseeing and improving technology. Societies that prepare their workforces through education and smart policies will enjoy more jobs, higher wages, and greater prosperity in the automated future.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T08:37:33.941Z

**You:** The writing question title is automation is transforming industries,potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency.Does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term.
Nowadays,automation is rapidly develop in our modern life,which always surrounding you and me.For example, AI is a good example for the automation equipment development. so below will fully focus on how automation affect the global employment prospects.
As we all know, before the automation rapidly development, as the worker, we just have one method to tackle our own task,that is made by your own hand with step-by-step. after automation appear, it brings a lot of pros for the employment prospects.For example,we can reduce the human mistake,boost the efficiency into mistake,boost the efficiency into all the related step and reduce the time or cost.
Let’s focus on ‘ultimately’ this word, obviously automation can hack most of the industries and jobs task, but I think that not all the process could without the human,seems like automation involved a lot of machine and some kind of the related equipment, so they can’t run a long-term period, seems like a human. Sometimes, that equipment of the automation need to recharge and fix it.This process is very rely on human.So it shows that in all employment environment can’t without the human,human exist is the key of all work.
Apart from that,if the automation being fully rely,that’s not a great phenomena when we imagine it. If the automation equipment getting shut down, then it will bring a the very bad outcome for the company on the industries processing, it will let the company pay for their mistakes.
To sum up all the points, I totally agree the automation is transforming industries,potentially reduce jobs while boosting efficiency. But it’s strongly think  this kind of the technological shift can’t ultimately enhance the global employment prospects in the long term future period.But undoubtedly automation can help a lot in global employment by generating diverse,higher-skilled jobs and driving economic expansion.Proactive education and policy adoption also are the key to ensuring widerspread benefit.

**Assistant:** Great — let’s start the three-step revision process. First, tell me which sentence in your automation essay is your current thesis statement (or paste it here). I’ll give clear feedback on clarity, strength, and focus, and then I’ll ask you to rewrite it before we move on.

Quick initial feedback based on what I see:
- Your current conclusion sentences look like the thesis, but they are confusing: they say both “I totally agree” and “can’t ultimately enhance,” which contradicts itself.
- A strong thesis must (1) clearly answer the question (do you think automation ultimately enhances or undermines global employment?), (2) preview the main points you will discuss, and (3) use confident, precise language (avoid “I think,” “maybe,” or mixed signals).
- Consider previewing 2–3 main reasons (example: short-term job displacement/efficiency gains; long-term creation of higher-skilled jobs and economic growth; need for education and policy to secure benefits).

Here is a simple template you can use to rewrite your thesis (fill the blanks — don’t copy a whole sentence from me):
- “I [agree / disagree / partly agree] that automation [enhances/undermines] global employment prospects because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using that template? Once you paste your revised thesis and confirm you’re happy with it, we’ll move to Step 2 (you’ll pick one body paragraph to work on).

*Time:* 2025-12-03T09:03:47.971Z

**You:** In the modern era, automation, exemplified by the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, is transforming industries worldwide. While concerns about job losses are widespread, the question remains whether automation ultimately enhances or undermines global employment prospects. I partly agree that automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term because, despite causing short-term job displacement, it creates more diverse and higher-skilled positions, drives overall economic growth, and increases demand for human oversight and innovation when supported by proactive education and policy measures.
First, automation undeniably leads to short-term job displacement in repetitive and routine tasks. Factory workers, data entry clerks, and even some white-collar roles are being replaced by machines that perform these tasks faster and with fewer errors. This transition can cause unemployment and economic hardship for workers whose skills suddenly become obsolete. However, history shows that technological revolutions—from the Industrial Revolution to the computer age—have always destroyed certain jobs while creating many more in the long run.
The most important long-term effect is the creation of new, higher-skilled, and better-paid jobs. Automation does not eliminate work; it shifts it. For every job lost in manufacturing or basic services, new positions emerge in fields such as robot maintenance, software development, data analysis, AI ethics, and creative industries that machines cannot easily replicate. Moreover, by dramatically increasing productivity and lowering costs, automation fuels economic expansion, leading to higher consumer demand and the birth of entirely new industries that employ millions.
Furthermore, machines still depend on humans in critical ways. Automated systems require design, programming, monitoring, repair, and upgrading—tasks that only skilled people can perform. Even advanced equipment needs energy, maintenance, and occasional human intervention. Rather than replacing humans completely, automation often complements human abilities, allowing workers to focus on more complex, creative, and supervisory roles.
Finally, the extent to which automation benefits global employment depends heavily on preparation. Countries that invest in retraining programs, lifelong education, and policies that help workers transition to new roles will see stronger job growth and less inequality. Without such measures, the gains from automation may concentrate among a small group of highly skilled individuals, leaving others behind.
In conclusion, although automation disrupts traditional jobs in the short term, it ultimately enhances global employment prospects by generating diverse, higher-skilled opportunities, stimulating economic growth, and maintaining the essential role of human expertise. With the right education and policy support, the net effect of automation will be more jobs, higher wages, and greater prosperity for societies that adapt wisely

**Assistant:** Thanks — I can see the sentence you intend as your thesis:

"I partly agree that automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term because, despite causing short-term job displacement, it creates more diverse and higher-skilled positions, drives overall economic growth, and increases demand for human oversight and innovation when supported by proactive education and policy measures."

Feedback on clarity, strength, and focus
- Strengths:
  - Directly answers the question and takes a clear stance (positive long-term view).
  - Previews three supporting ideas (short-term displacement, new higher-skilled jobs/economic growth, need for education/policy).
- Issues to fix:
  - Mixed signal from “partly agree” + “will ultimately enhance”: decide whether you want a firm long-term claim or a qualified/conditional one. The current wording reads slightly contradictory.
  - The sentence is long and a little wordy. Shorten for precision and academic tone.
  - The last clause (“when supported by proactive education and policy measures”) is important, but it reads like a condition tacked on. Consider integrating the conditional more clearly.
  - Avoid weak hedges like “I partly agree” if you intend to present a clear long-term claim; if you genuinely want to qualify your claim, make the qualification explicit and balanced.

How to improve (brief guidance — not a full rewrite)
- Decide: do you want to argue that automation ultimately enhances employment (with conditions), or that you partly agree because there are both benefits and risks? Make that position consistent.
- Keep 2–3 concise preview points (e.g., short-term displacement; creation of higher-skilled jobs and growth; importance of education/policy).
- Use confident, precise language and reduce redundancy.

Quick template to help you rewrite (fill in the blanks — do not copy a full example from me):
- “I [agree / partly agree / disagree] that automation [enhances/undermines] global employment prospects because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using that template? Once you paste the revised version and confirm you’re happy with it, we’ll move to Step 2 and choose a body paragraph to revise.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T09:11:54.900Z

**You:** Above Is my rewrite sample

*Time:* 2025-12-03T09:13:57.700Z

**Assistant:** Good work — this thesis has many strong elements. Brief, focused feedback before you revise:

Strengths
- Directly answers the question and takes a clear long-term position.
- Previews three supporting ideas (displacement; new higher-skilled roles and growth; need for education/policy).
- Shows nuance by mentioning conditions.

Problems to fix
- Mixed signal: “I partly agree” + “will ultimately enhance” reads contradictory. Decide whether you are making a qualified (partly agree) or a firm (agree) claim and make that consistent.
- Wordy and slightly repetitive: “ultimately” and “in the long term” mean the same thing.
- The conditional phrase (“when supported by proactive education and policy measures”) feels tacked on at the end. If the condition is central, integrate it more clearly or present it as one of your previewed points.
- Avoid extra hedges; use confident, precise language suitable for an academic essay.

How to revise (choose one approach)
- Option A (clear, confident claim): Use a single confident stance and preview 2–3 reasons. Template: “I [agree / disagree] that automation [enhances / undermines] global employment prospects because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”
- Option B (qualified claim with explicit condition): Make the qualification clear and present the condition as part of the claim. Template: “I partly agree that automation can improve long-term employment prospects, provided that [key condition]; this is because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”

Keep your preview concise (two to three items) and avoid redundant phrases.

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using one of those templates? Paste the new version here, and tell me if you’re satisfied with it. Once you confirm the revised thesis, we’ll move to Step 2 and pick one body paragraph to revise.

**Assistant:** Thanks — I can see the sentence you intend as your thesis:

"Although automation causes short-term job displacement, it will ultimately enhance global employment prospects because it creates more diverse and higher-skilled jobs, drives broader economic growth through increased productivity, and continues to depend on human expertise for oversight, maintenance, and innovation."

Feedback on clarity, strength, and focus
- Strengths
  - Directly answers the question and takes a clear long-term position.
  - Previews three concrete supporting points (displacement; new higher-skilled jobs and growth; human oversight).
  - Shows useful nuance about short-term harm versus long-term benefit.

- Areas to improve
  - Slightly long and wordy — you can make it more concise and forceful.
  - Decide whether to present a firm claim or a qualified one. Right now it mixes a concession (“Although…”) with a strong eventual claim; that can work, but keep it tight.
  - The conditional idea that benefits depend on policy/education is important; if you want it central, either integrate it into the thesis as one preview point or mention it briefly as a necessary condition.
  - Avoid redundant phrases (e.g., “ultimately” + “in the long term” elsewhere) and reduce lists that make the sentence heavy.

Quick revision guidance (do not copy a full sentence from me)
- If you want a confident claim: state your stance plainly and preview 2–3 reasons.
- If you want a qualified claim: say you “partly agree” or “argue that automation can enhance… provided that…” and preview reasons including policy/education.

Two short templates you can use (fill the blanks)
- Confident stance: “I [agree/disagree] that automation [enhances/undermines] global employment prospects because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”
