            ## Contribution Analysis

            Based on the training assessment report and chat history you provided, here is a summary of key points and next steps you might consider:

---

### Summary of Current Situation

- The student located the thesis statement but did not produce their own revision after AI guidance.
- No revisions were made to the thesis, topic sentences, or body paragraphs.
- No deeper engagement or critical evaluation of AI suggestions took place.
- The essay text remained identical before and after the “revision” attempt.
- Human–AI interaction was minimal and task completion incomplete.

---

### Suggested Next Steps for the Student

1. **Active Revision Practice**  
   Instead of asking the AI to rewrite, try **drafting your own revision** based on feedback. For example, take the original thesis and write a new version using confident and precise language as suggested.

2. **Engage in Dialogue**  
   Use the AI as a partner: share your draft revision, then ask for feedback and make improvements—you can repeat this process to deepen learning.

3. **Revise in Stages**  
   Start small:  
   - First, rewrite only the thesis statement.  
   - Next, revise one topic sentence.  
   - Then, revise one body paragraph for clarity and grammar.

4. **Critically Evaluate AI Suggestions**  
   Don’t just accept AI outputs—compare suggestions with your own ideas, and decide which wording or structure works best for your essay.

5. **Expand Interaction**  
   Ask clarifying questions like:  
   - “Why is this phrasing better?”  
   - “Can you explain how this transition improves the flow?”  
   - “What are alternative ways to express this idea?”

---

### Sample Example to Help the Student Get Started

**Original Thesis:**  
"I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

**Revised Thesis (Example):**  
"While the actions of governments and large corporations play a crucial role in combating climate change, citizens significantly influence government policies and contribute through personal lifestyle choices that, although less impactful, support environmental progress."

**Next Step:**  
Try writing your own revision following this model, then share it for feedback.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

1. **Essay Writing Skills:** Practice revising key elements (thesis statement, topic sentences, body paragraphs) independently, then use AI for feedback rather than full rewriting.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills:** Develop habits of discussing suggestions with the AI, asking follow-up questions, and making choices about edits.
3. **Overall Improvement:** Start revision with small, specific changes (e.g., reword the thesis), then build out to larger structural edits; focus on conversational learning with the AI.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES

- The student did not complete the minimum required revision steps.
- Recommend a targeted coaching session focused on active revision and enhanced engagement with AI feedback.
- Encourage student to independently draft revisions and use the AI for support, NOT replacement.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:16:08.448Z

**You:** I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:19:14.002Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s start with **Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**.

Here is the thesis statement you’ve shared:

> I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

**Feedback:**

- **Clarity:** Your thesis makes your position clear, but it could directly answer the essay question in a more precise way.
- **Structure/Focus:** It’s a bit long and uses “I believe” and “I also think,” which can be replaced with more assertive language.
- **Preview of Main Points:** It does indicate two areas (influencing government and personal lifestyle choices), which is good. However, previewing them in a slightly more concrete way could help.
- **Language:** Phrases like “I believe” and “I also think” are less academic. Confident, objective language is stronger.

**Guiding Prompts:**
- Can you try rewriting this thesis statement to use more confident language?
- See if you can clearly state your position and briefly mention BOTH influencing government and personal actions (as you do), but without “I believe” or “I think.”

**You:** Can you try rewriting this thesis statement to use more confident language?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:21:28.004Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Please take a moment to revise your thesis statement, focusing on these points:

- Use confident language (avoid “I believe” or “I think”).
- Make sure it answers the essay question directly.
- Clearly preview both the role of individuals in influencing governments and the impact of personal lifestyle choices.

Here’s a gentle hint to help you get started:
Try beginning with a phrase like:  
“While individual actions may have less impact than those of governments and companies, citizens…”
