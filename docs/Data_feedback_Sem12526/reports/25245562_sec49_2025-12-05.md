---

### Human-AI Interaction Analysis

**Chat Interaction Characteristics:**
- Total exchanges: 11
- Student repeatedly commands "revise thesis/topic sentences/paragraph/rest of essay" without engaging in the assistant’s negotiation questions.
- Assistant provides structured revision process (three-step: thesis, topic sentence, paragraph), requests goal selection and topic alignment, but these prompts are mostly unanswered.
- Student rarely provides clarifications, no negotiation of revision direction or critique of AI suggestions.
- The conversation shows only basic engagement and minimal refinement collaboration.

**Scores:**
- In-depth Conversation: Moderate (3/5) - Assistant led the process but student gave brief commands rather than elaborated input.
- Critical Review of AI Suggestions: Basic (2/5) - No evidence student explicitly assessed or rejected AI feedback.
- Refining Process: Basic (2/5) - Assistant encouraged iterative steps; student bypassed negotiation and independently revised the essay.

---

### Strengths Demonstrated
- Student shows strong motivation for revision by repeatedly requesting help.
- Successfully restructured and clarified written content with clearer thesis and paragraph focus.
- Willingness to refine language, vocabulary, and organization.

---

### Areas for Improvement
- Align essay content strictly with the assigned prompt; clarify topic focus in chat early on.
- Engage actively in AI-led revision planning: respond to prompts about goals, paragraph choice, and topic to improve revision effectiveness.
- Proofread carefully for grammar (subject-verb agreement, collocations) and enhance academic phrasing.
- Add credible evidence or references to support claims and increase essay credibility.

---

### Recommendations for Future Development
1. Before revision, clearly specify the assignment prompt and confirm topic selection with AI assistant.
2. Respond fully to AI negotiation prompts to harness iterative, targeted revision.
3. Continue improving grammar accuracy and vocabulary choice; maintain academic tone.
4. Incorporate concrete examples, data, or citations to substantiate key claims.
5. Consider critical reflection on AI suggestions: accept or challenge changes actively to deepen learning.

---

### Instructor Notes
- The student made notable progress in writing clarity and organization but produced an essay misaligned with the assignment prompt on climate change.
- Ensure expectations are clear about the essay topic; if AI/employment is not acceptable, instruct student to rewrite on the correct theme.
- Encourage more dialogic, interactive engagement with AI prompts to maximize revision benefits.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 12/25 - The draft expresses a basic claim that automation reduces employment and overreliance on AI harms human skills, but ideas are underdeveloped and the piece is off-task relative to the climate-change prompt. Example: "this technological shift ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long time." Lacks evidence and clear organization of arguments.
- Organization: 14/25 - There are paragraph breaks and two main idea groups, but logical progression and clear topic sentences are weak. Transitions are minimal and some sentences are list-like rather than developed.
- Vocabulary: 13/25 - Student attempts relevant terms (automation, AI) but frequent misspellings and word-choice errors reduce clarity ("high speach", "qulity", "gnw out").
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 10/25 - Many errors (subject-verb agreement, articles, word order) impede understanding: e.g., "AI do not have any emotions and they can work day and night" and "Trying to make outstanding from AI, human need to find more high quility things to do..."
- **Original Essay Total: 49/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The revised essay clarifies the main claim (automation harms long-term employment prospects) and adds examples and suggestions for human-specialty fields ("creative arts, personalized education, and community-based care"). However, it remains off-topic relative to the climate-change assignment and lacks empirical citation or stronger development of cause-effect.
- Organization: 18/25 - Paragraphing is clearer, topic sentences are more explicit (e.g., "Compared to hiring employees, using AI may cost less salary."), and the essay ends with a summarizing paragraph that proposes fields for human advantage. Flow improved but some transitions could be tighter.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Word choice has improved (rapid pace, high-skill, Full-Time Equivalent), though awkward phrases remain ("in the long time," "work outstandingly") and some collocations need polishing.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 16/25 - Noticeable improvement in sentence structure and punctuation (use of em dash, clearer clauses), but grammatical errors persist (e.g., "AI do not" → "AI does not" or "AI do not have" should be "AI does not have" if treated singular; "human need" → "humans need"; "in the long time" → "in the long term").
- **Revised Essay Total: 70/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +21 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clearer thesis/topic focus in the opening sentence: revised to "Yes, as automated technologies are applied across different fields, this technological shift will ultimately undermine global employment prospects..."
  - Stronger topic sentences and paragraph division (e.g., explicit paragraph opening: "Compared to hiring employees, using AI may cost less salary.")
  - More concrete examples and suggested human-advantage fields at the end ("creative arts, personalized education, and community-based care") that offer a forward-looking solution.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Alignment with assignment prompt: the essay discusses AI and employment, not individual vs government actions on climate—this is a major task-level mismatch.
  - Need for evidence/citations: claims about employment impact and sector percentages are unsubstantiated (reference to "Full-Time Equivalent Employment Exposed to Automation AI" is vague and not cited).
  - Remaining grammar and phrasing issues (subject-verb agreement, collocation errors) and some awkward phrasing that reduce academic tone.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 11**
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided a structured, pedagogy-driven revision plan (three-step process: revise thesis, topic sentence, then paragraph). The student repeatedly requested quick actions ("Revise thesis statement", "Revise topic sentences", "Revise one body paragraph", "Revise the rest of the essay") but did not engage in the assistant's requested negotiation (choosing goals, pathway, or pasting a thesis). Example of student repetition: user messages are short commands without the clarifying information the assistant requested. The assistant repeatedly asked the student to pick priorities and confirm topic focus, but the student did not provide those required inputs.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Developing. Evidence: 11 exchanges show moderate engagement and a clear plan from the assistant, but the student's responses were brief commands rather than substantive negotiation or multi-level questioning that would indicate deeper engagement. The assistant gave multi-part guidance (see first assistant message describing steps and negotiation).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - Basic. Evidence: The chat shows no evidence that the student evaluated or rejected AI suggestions with reasoning. The user repeatedly requested revisions but did not discuss or critique the assistant’s suggestions (no quotes like "I prefer X because..." or "I disagree with this change because...").
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - Basic. Evidence: The assistant proposed an iterative three-step process, but the student did not follow the negotiation steps or provide incremental choices; instead the student repeatedly asked for revisions and then produced a revised essay independently. The chat contains multiple assistant prompts asking the student to select a pathway and to paste a thesis, which were not answered.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Student independently revised the essay into a clearer English version, improving sentence coherence and paragraph structure (evidence: revised opening sentence and added closing paragraph naming specific fields).
- The revised essay includes more explicit topic sentences and connective phrasing (e.g., "Compared to hiring employees..." and "What's more, human should alarm themselves...").
- The student demonstrates willingness to act on revision (multiple requests to the assistant to "revise" indicate high motivation to improve).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Task alignment: Ensure the essay responds to the assigned prompt. This submission is about AI and employment, while the class prompt (as referenced by the assistant) concerns individual actions vs governments/corporations on climate change.
- Engagement with AI: When the assistant requests choices (goals, paragraph to revise, thesis), supply those specifics so the AI can produce targeted, stepwise edits.
- Grammar and formal academic phrasing: Continue editing for subject-verb agreement, pluralization, and idiomatic collocations (e.g., "in the long term," "humans need," "work outstandingly" → "perform at a high level").
- Evidence and development: Add concrete data, cited reports, or concrete examples to support claims about employment sectors and automation exposure.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student did not specify the assignment prompt in chat; the assistant inferred and repeatedly requested confirmation. Evidence: assistant's repeated prompts asking whether to switch to climate prompt or keep AI topic.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The assistant provided a clear plan but the student did not engage in planning steps (choosing goals/pathway). Evidence: assistant's multiple requests for choices were not answered.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student did not show evidence of evaluating AI suggestions (no acceptance/rejection rationale in chat).
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The student performed substantive independent revisions to the essay outside of the structured assistant-led steps (revised thesis, topic sentences, and paragraphs).

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Align topic to prompt before revising: confirm the assignment focus in chat (e.g., "I will change my essay to answer the climate-change prompt") so the assistant can produce targeted thesis and paragraph revisions.
2. Follow the assistant’s negotiation steps: when the AI asks you to pick goals and confirm which paragraph to revise, answer those to enable efficient, iterative improvement.
3. Proofread for persistent grammar issues and add evidence: focus on subject-verb agreement, plural/singular consistency, and idiomatic collocations; add concrete citations or statistics to support claims about automation impact.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student clearly revised their draft and improved clarity and organisation, which shows effort. However, the submission appears misaligned with the stated assignment prompt (climate change vs AI/employment). Please advise the student whether this AI/employment topic is acceptable for grading or require a rewrite to match the course prompt.
- The student's chat engagement was minimal and directive — encourage them to answer AI prompts (choose pathway, paste thesis) so they can better leverage guided, iterative revision with the assistant.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Yes, as the automatic skills be used in different filed, this technological shift ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long time. Nowadays, the automation is developing in a high speach, it is not limited to insteading some basic power work (such as farming, water-line work, building constructures), it can be used in some high quility work like chating, calculating, and even be a helper for doctors which fight for the hospital. While the population still large around the world, people have high stress working on standing out of their peers because the need for employers is fewer. However, compared to hire employments, there may be less salary by using AI. AI do not have any emotions and they can work day and night. Abvioudly, some companies are willing to choose AI for gaining more profit. So that the employment chance must less than before due to AI’s convenience and smartness (they are easier to control than human). According to the share of Full-Time Equivaient Employment Exposed to Automation AI, we can find that some areas have high percentage on using AI, using AI to work has been a popular trend. Trying to make outstanding from AI, human need to find more high quility things to do and learn to reduce making mistake.

What's more, human should alarm themselves not to rely on AI too much as we are always used to using AI to gnw out some ideas (doing homework and marketing some important things). It seems that the wide usage of AI is leading people to lose thinking, memorizing, communiting ability. When we rely on AI, we are struggle to dig own talents and work outstanding. It should be a long time for human to find some new works in special fields which AI can’t do it to solve the employment promblem.

Revised:
Yes, as automated technologies are applied across different fields, this technological shift will ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long time. Nowadays, automation is developing at a rapid pace—it is not limited to replacing some basic manual work (such as farming, water-line work, building construction), but also can be used in some high-skill work like chatting, calculating, and even be a helper for doctors who work in the hospital. While the population around the world is still large, people have high stress to stand out among their peers because the need for employers is fewer.

Compared to hiring employees, using AI may cost less salary. AI do not have any emotions and they can work day and night. Obviously, some companies are willing to choose AI for gaining more profit. So that the employment chance must be less than before due to AI’s convenience and smartness—after all, they are easier to control than human. According to the share of Full-Time Equivalent Employment Exposed to Automation AI, we can find that some areas like manufacturing, administrative work, and healthcare have high percentage on using AI, so using AI to work has been a popular trend.

Trying to make outstanding from AI, human need to find more high-value things to do and learn to reduce making mistakes. What's more, human should alarm themselves not to rely on AI too much—we are always used to using AI to work out some ideas (like doing homework and designing some important marketing things). It seems that the wide usage of AI is leading people to lose thinking, memorizing, communicating ability. When we rely on AI too much, we are struggling to dig our own talents and work outstandingly.

It should be a long time for human to find some new works in special fields which AI can’t do to solve the employment problem. These fields, such as creative arts, personalized education, and community-based care, can give full play to human’s unique advantages, and help people adapt to the job market changed by technological development.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-05T13:52:03.299Z

**You:** Revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-12-05T13:52:40.719Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m ready to help you revise your thesis, but first we need to do a quick negotiation and diagnosis so we focus the session where it will help most.

1) Your goals
- What do you most want to improve today? (Choose one or two.)
  - Clarity and precision of ideas
  - Strength of argument / thesis
  - Organisation and paragraph structure
  - Use of evidence and development
  - Vocabulary and academic style
  - Grammar and sentence accuracy

2) Quick diagnostic note
- I can’t review your essay yet because the draft you uploaded is empty. Based on the prompt (“Some people believe that individual actions are insignificant… To what extent do you agree or disagree?”) and common student needs at your level, here are likely strengths and weaknesses I would watch for:
  - Thesis & Argument: Students often give a vague or hedged thesis (e.g., “I think both individuals and governments are important”), which doesn’t clearly answer the question or preview main points.
  - Organisation: Paragraphs sometimes list ideas without a clear logical progression or clear topic sentences linking back to the thesis.
  - Evidence & Development: Examples may be general ( “people should recycle”) without specific explanation of how they add to the argument.
  - Language Use: Vocabulary can be limited or repetitive; some hedging language weakens claims. Grammar errors may interrupt clarity.
- If you share your actual essay or thesis, I’ll give specific diagnostic feedback tied to the rubric.

3) Choose priorities
- Which of the above do you want to focus on right now? (For this session I suggest we focus on: 1) Thesis strength & clarity, and 2) Then one body paragraph’s topic sentence and paragraph development — that follows the three-step revision process we’ll use. Does that work?)

4) Next step (thesis)
- Do you already have a thesis sentence you want me to help revise? If yes, please paste it now.
- If you don’t have one yet, would you like me to suggest 2–3 model thesis statements (agree / disagree / partly agree) for this prompt, and then you choose one to refine?

Tell me your goal choice and paste your current thesis (or say “propose thesis”) and we’ll begin Step 1.

*Time:* 2025-12-05T13:52:56.588Z

**You:** Revise topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-12-05T13:54:46.954Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for sharing your draft. Before we start revising, let’s do the quick negotiation and diagnosis so we focus on what will help you most.

1) Pick your goals (choose one or two)
Which of these do you most want to work on right now?
- Clarity and precision of ideas
- Strength of argument / thesis (answering the question clearly)
- Organisation and paragraph structure (topic sentences, unity)
- Use of evidence and development
- Vocabulary and academic style
- Grammar and sentence accuracy

Tell me which one or two you want to focus on.

2) Important diagnostic note (brief and honest)
I checked your draft and there’s a big issue we need to address first: the essay you wrote talks about AI and employment, but the assignment asks about individual actions vs governments/corporations in the fight against climate change. That means the essay is off-task. Before we revise sentences, we must decide whether you want to:
- Change the content to respond to the climate-change prompt, or
- Confirm that you meant to write about AI (in which case we’d need to treat this as a different assignment).

Aside from being off-topic, here are specific strengths and areas for improvement tied to the rubric categories:

- Content and Ideas
  - Strength: You have some clear claims (e.g., automation reduces jobs; AI can work continuously) and attempt to explain consequences.
  - Needs work: The ideas do not address the assigned question. The central claim (thesis) is unclear and grammatically weak. Score estimate: 1–2 (Limited/Basic) because of irrelevance and lack of a clear, developed viewpoint for the given prompt.

- Organisation and Logical Progression
  - Strength: The draft is divided into paragraphs.
  - Needs work: Paragraphs list ideas without clear logical links or strong topic sentences tied to a central thesis. Transitions are weak. Score estimate: 2 (Basic).

- Vocabulary
  - Strength: Attempts at topic-specific words (automation, AI).
  - Needs work: Frequent misspellings and word choice errors reduce clarity (e.g., “high speach,” “qulity,” “gnw out”). Score estimate: 2 (Basic).

- Grammar and Sentence Structure
  - Needs work: Many grammar and sentence-structure errors that make meaning unclear (subject-verb agreement, articles, word order). Score estimate: 1–2 (Limited/Basic).

3) Choose revision priorities
Given the rubric and task, I recommend we focus on one of two pathways:
A) If you want to write for the climate-change prompt: revise a clear thesis that answers the question, then revise one body paragraph (topic sentence + paragraph) so it connects to the new thesis.
B) If you intended to write about AI: we’ll keep your topic but still follow the three-step process (revise thesis, then revise one paragraph).

Which pathway do you want? And which two goals from section (1) do you want to focus on? (I suggest: Strength of argument/thesis and Organisation/topic sentences.)

4) Next, before Step 1 (thesis)
- Do you already have a thesis sentence for the climate-change prompt? If yes, paste it now.
- If you don’t, tell me whether you want me to:
  - Propose 2–3 model thesis sentences (agree / disagree / partly agree) for the climate-change prompt that you can choose and revise, or
  - Work with a thesis for the AI topic (paste your current thesis).

5) Which paragraph to revise?
Also tell me: which body paragraph would you like to work on for Step 2 and Step 3 — the first paragraph (about employment/AI) or the second paragraph (about relying on AI reducing human skills)?

Once you answer: (a) your chosen goals, (b) pathway (climate prompt or AI topic), (c) whether you want model theses or will paste yours, and (d) which paragraph to revise — we’ll begin Step 1: thesis revision.

Would you like to choose now?

*Time:* 2025-12-05T13:55:11.194Z

**You:** Revise topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-12-05T13:55:32.970Z

**Assistant:** Great — I can help with topic sentences, but first we need the short negotiation and diagnosis so we follow the agreed three-step process. Please answer these quickly so we can start.

1) Pick 1–2 revision goals (choose from):
- Clarity and precision of ideas
- Strength of argument / thesis
- Organisation and paragraph structure (topic sentences, unity)
- Use of evidence and development
- Vocabulary and academic style
- Grammar and sentence accuracy

2) Important: your draft is about AI and employment, but the assignment prompt asks about individual actions vs governments/corporations in fighting climate change. Which do you want to do for this session?
- A: Revise the essay to respond to the climate-change prompt, or
- B: Keep the current AI topic and treat this as a different assignment?

3) Which paragraph do you want to work on for the topic-sentence and paragraph revision?
- Paragraph 1 (about automation / jobs)
- Paragraph 2 (about relying on AI harming skills)

4) Thesis: Do you already have a thesis for your chosen topic?
- If yes: paste your current thesis now.
- If no and you chose A (climate prompt): type “propose thesis” and I’ll offer 2–3 model thesis options (agree / disagree / partly agree) for you to choose and revise.

When you answer (1–4), we’ll begin Step 1 (thesis revision). If you want me to start by helping you try a new topic sentence, tell me which paragraph again and paste the current topic sentence — but remember we must revise the thesis first so topic sentences clearly connect to it. Would you like to proceed?

*Time:* 2025-12-05T13:55:43.502Z

**You:** Revise one body paragraph

*Time:* 2025-12-05T13:56:46.789Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I can do this. A few quick steps first so we follow the agreed process.

1) Two quick choices (please answer both)
A. Topic: your draft is about AI and jobs, but the assignment asks about individual actions vs governments/corporations in fighting climate change. Which do you want for this session?
- A1: Change the essay to respond to the climate-change prompt (recommended)
- A2: Keep working on the AI/employment draft (we’ll treat it as a different assignment)

B. Revision goals: pick one or two from this list (I’ll focus feedback on these)
- Clarity and precision of ideas
- Strength of argument / thesis
- Organisation and paragraph structure (topic sentences, unity)
- Use of evidence and development
- Vocabulary and academic style
- Grammar and sentence accuracy

2) Brief diagnostic (very short)
- On-task issue: The current draft is off-topic for the climate prompt (if you want to respond to the climate prompt, we must rewrite the thesis and at least adapt paragraph content).
- Strengths: you make clear claims, and you have two paragraphs you can develop further.
- Main weaknesses: unclear/weak thesis, many grammar and vocabulary errors, paragraphs need clearer topic sentences and tighter development.
- Rubric risk: Content and Organisation scores are low now because of off-task content and weak structure.

3) Paragraph choice
Which body paragraph do you want to revise (topic sentence + rest)?
- Paragraph 1 (about automation and jobs)
- Paragraph 2 (about relying on AI harming skills)

4) Thesis
Do you already have a thesis for the topic you chose in (1A)?
- If yes: paste the thesis now.
- If no and you chose A1 (climate prompt): type “propose thesis” and I’ll give 2–3 model thesis sentences (agree / disagree / partly agree) for you to pick and revise.
- If no and you chose A2 (AI topic): paste a one-sentence thesis or say “I’ll write one now” and try one, then I’ll give feedback.

Once you answer A, B, paragraph choice, and paste or request a thesis, we’ll begin Step 1 (thesis revision). Would you like to proceed?

*Time:* 2025-12-05T13:57:02.279Z

**You:** Revise the rest of the essay

*Time:* 2025-12-05T13:58:38.765Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I can do this. Before I revise anything, we need a very quick negotiation and diagnosis so we follow the agreed three‑step process. I’ll keep it short.

1) Two quick choices (please answer both)
A. Topic for this session (your draft is about AI and jobs, but the assignment prompt asks about individual actions vs governments/corporations fighting climate change). Which do you want to work on now?
- A1: Change the essay to respond to the climate‑change prompt (recommended for this assignment)
- A2: Keep the current AI/employment topic (we’ll treat it as a different assignment)

B. Revision goals — pick one or two (I’ll focus feedback on these):
- Clarity and precision of ideas
- Strength of argument / thesis
- Organisation and paragraph structure (topic sentences, unity)
- Use of evidence and development
- Vocabulary and academic style
- Grammar and sentence accuracy

2) Brief diagnostic (very short, tied to the rubric)
- Major problem: the content currently does not respond to the climate‑change prompt. If you want to meet the assignment, we must change the thesis and at least adapt paragraph content.
- Strengths: you make clear claims and have two paragraphs to develop.
- Main weaknesses: off‑topic content (for the climate prompt), weak/unclear thesis, many grammar and spelling errors, paragraph topic sentences need clearer connection to a thesis.
- Rubric risk: Content and Organisation scores are low now because of off‑task content and weak structure.

3) Paragraph choice (for Steps 2–3)
Which body paragraph shall we revise (topic sentence + supporting sentences)?
- Paragraph 1 (your paragraph about automation and jobs)
- Paragraph 2 (your paragraph about relying on AI harming skills)

4) Thesis
Do you already have a thesis for the topic you chose in (1A)?
- If yes: paste the thesis now.
- If no and you chose A1 (climate prompt): type “propose thesis” and I will give 2–3 model thesis sentences (agree / disagree / partly agree) for you to choose and revise.
- If no and you chose A2 (AI topic): paste a one‑sentence thesis or say “I’ll write one now” and try one, then I’ll give feedback.

Reminder about scope: in this session I will revise only the thesis, one body paragraph’s topic sentence, and that paragraph’s content. I won’t rewrite the whole essay.

Which options do you choose for A, B, and which paragraph? Would you like me to propose model thesis sentences now?
