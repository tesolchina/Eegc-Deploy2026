            ## Contribution Analysis

            ### Training Assessment Summary and Recommendations

#### Summary of Student Performance and Interaction 
- The student retained the original essay’s main ideas and paragraph structure but did not complete requested revisions.
- Throughout the chat, the student repeatedly used placeholders such as “let’s pretend we have revised…” instead of providing actual revised text.
- The AI assistant provided detailed, structured guidance for revising the thesis and paragraph topic sentences with clear templates and stepwise instructions.
- However, the student did not supply a revised thesis or topic sentences as required and refused to engage in the iterative revision process.
- This resulted in no observable improvements in content clarity, organization, vocabulary, or grammar.
- The assistant repeatedly emphasized the mandatory nature of producing a revised thesis before moving forward, but the student ignored this, impeding progress.

#### Strengths
- The student shows understanding of the essay’s key ideas and structure.
- The AI provided comprehensive, scaffolded support, including fill-in-the-blank templates for thesis and topic sentence revision.
- The conversation was sustained over many turns, showing some willingness to engage.

#### Areas for Improvement
- **Concrete Revision Submission:** The student must produce actual revised sentences and paragraphs when asked rather than using placeholders or avoidance language.
- **Critical Engagement:** Instead of deferring or ignoring suggestions, the student should evaluate AI feedback, choose how to incorporate it, and explain any decisions.
- **Following Process Steps:** The mandatory revision sequence (thesis first, then paragraphs) must be followed strictly to ensure foundational improvements.
- **Revision Practice:** Actively applying AI guidance through real text changes is key to developing writing skills.

#### Recommendations for Future Development
1. **Complete the Thesis Revision Step:** The student should craft and submit a revised thesis statement that clearly states partial agreement and previews two parallel reasons, following the AI’s template.
2. **Revise Topic Sentences and Paragraph #1:** After thesis approval, submit the revised topic sentence and full rewrite of body paragraph #1 based on the AI’s suggested structures.
3. **Engage in Critical Dialogue:** When presented with AI alternatives, explicitly accept, adapt, or reject them with reasoning to deepen collaborative learning.
4. **Avoid Placeholders:** Provide genuine writing samples for revision. This will make feedback meaningful and promote actual skill development.
5. **Instructor Check-in:** It is recommended the instructor clarify assignment expectations with the student, emphasizing the requirement for concrete edits rather than fictive placeholders.
6. **Live Guided Revision:** Consider conducting a supervised, live revision session to model the process and reinforce revision norms.

---

**Overall:** The student has the foundational understanding and AI support necessary for improvement but must actively produce real text revisions and engage critically with guidance to demonstrate actual learning progress.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - Clear stance ("partly agree") and two supporting ideas (influence on government; personal habits). Development is adequate but repetitive and lacks depth and specific, well-explained evidence.
- Organization: 19/25 - Standard essay structure (intro, two body paragraphs, conclusion) with logical progression, but paragraph development and transitions are weak and sometimes repetitive.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Adequate everyday vocabulary; some repetition and limited use of precise, topic-specific terms.
- Grammar: 16/25 - Frequent grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that sometimes reduce clarity (e.g., "the government maybe just listen a little", "so nothing happen").
- **Original Essay Total: 73/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 15/25 - Revision is incomplete. The revised file contains placeholders ("bla bla bla", "(revised thesis statement here)") rather than substantive changes; the core ideas remain but the promised improvements are not implemented.
- Organization: 14/25 - Structural elements remain but are interrupted by placeholders and missing thesis/topic sentences, which undermines coherence and reader guidance.
- Vocabulary: 12/25 - Placeholders and informal filler weaken lexical quality; few improvements to word choice are evident.
- Grammar: 12/25 - Original grammatical issues persist and are compounded by informal placeholders and ellipses; no evidence of substantive sentence-level editing.
- **Revised Essay Total: 53/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -20 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Minimal: the revised draft retains the original essay’s central ideas and examples (e.g., voting/protests and consumer choices).
  - The student preserved the original paragraph structure (intro/body/conclusion), so the baseline framework is present.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The thesis was not actually revised; placeholders indicate the student did not produce a firmer, concise thesis as requested.
  - Topic sentences were not clearly rewritten; placeholders ("let’s pretend we have revised topic sentences") prevent evaluation of improvement.
  - Body paragraph #1 was not revised; the request to "revise the rest of body paragraph #1" was not completed. There is no evidence of improved clarity, stronger evidence, or corrected grammar.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 18** messages (assistant and student turns combined).
- **Conversation Quality:** The AI assistant provided structured, pedagogical guidance (thesis template, topic-sentence templates, stepwise process). The student repeatedly avoided producing concrete revisions, often responding with "let's pretend..." or similar placeholders, which prevented meaningful revision cycles.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - The chat contains an extensive back-and-forth (18 messages). The assistant provided multi-step instructions and templates, and the session shows repeated iterations and prompts from the assistant.
  - Evidence: assistant gave detailed Step 1 checklist and fill-in-the-blank templates across multiple messages.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - The student did not meaningfully evaluate or critique the AI's suggestions. Instead of implementing or responding to templates, the student repeatedly wrote placeholder lines ("let's pretend we have revised..."), showing little engagement in evaluating or choosing among options.
  - Evidence: user responses such as "let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and bla bla bla ..." and "let's pretend we have revised topic sentences and move on bla bla bla …" (multiple messages).
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - Although there were many turns, there is no evidence of iterative revision of text based on AI feedback. The assistant requested concrete revisions and templates repeatedly; the student did not supply refined drafts or edits for review.
  - Evidence: assistant repeatedly asked for either a pasted revised thesis or an explicit confirmation ("I confirm the revised thesis is ready") before proceeding; the student did not provide either.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 9/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student has a clear initial understanding of the essay’s main stance and two supporting ideas (evidence: original thesis and body paragraph topics referencing government influence and personal lifestyle).
- The AI assistant offered structured, actionable guidance (templates for thesis and topic sentences, stepwise instructions).
- The student engaged in sustained conversation (18 exchanges), indicating willingness to interact.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Follow-through: Produce concrete revisions when requested. Replace placeholders with actual revised sentences/paragraphs.
- Critical engagement: Evaluate AI suggestions—accept, adapt, or reject with reasons—rather than deferring or pretending to revise.
- Revision practice: Implement at least one full revision cycle: submit a revised thesis, revise one topic sentence, and provide a rewritten body paragraph for feedback.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - the student provided the original essay and indicated which paragraph to work on; course/module context implicit. Evidence: original essay text and instruction in chat to revise paragraph #1.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - the student did not follow the assistant's stepwise plan (required thesis revision first) and repeatedly skipped mandatory steps.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - the student did not critically evaluate AI suggestions or justify choices; responses defaulted to avoidance.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - the student did not apply AI guidance to produce actual edits (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph rewrite).

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Complete the mandatory first step: produce and paste a revised thesis statement that clearly states the extent of agreement and previews two parallel reasons. Use the assistant’s template and submit a single confident sentence.
2. After the thesis is accepted, rewrite one topic sentence and the full body paragraph in one message (no placeholders). Apply AI-suggested templates and then ask for targeted feedback.
3. Practice critical review: when the AI suggests alternatives, explicitly state which you accept or reject and why. This will improve strategic collaboration and revision quality.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student shows engagement (multiple turns) but avoids concrete revision work. This pattern suggests either misunderstanding of the exercise requirements or reluctance to produce text for revision.
- Recommend an instructor check-in to clarify assignment expectations: confirm that the student must submit actual revised sentences/paragraphs (not placeholders) to demonstrate learning outcomes.
- Consider guiding the student through a short in-class revision exercise where the thesis is revised together and one paragraph is rewritten with live feedback.

Evidence quotes (from chat and essays)
- Student placeholder responses: "let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and bla bla bla ...", "let's pretend we have revised topic sentences and move on bla bla bla …"
- Assistant request for mandatory step: "Okay — Step 1 is mandatory, so before we move on I need either your revised thesis sentence or a clear confirmation that you’ve finished revising it."
- Original thesis (student): "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Overall: the student has not completed the required revision tasks. The AI provided appropriate structured guidance, but the student must submit concrete revised text and demonstrate critical engagement to progress.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T07:02:55.826Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T07:04:55.021Z

**Assistant:** Step 1 — Thesis statement review

Thanks — I can see your current thesis:  
"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Quick feedback on clarity, strength, and focus
- Clarity: The stance is clear (you partly agree), but the sentence is wordy and repeats ideas. It could be more concise.
- Strength: It names two reasons (influence on government; personal lifestyle choices) — good. But the language ("I believe", "I also think", "while less impactful") weakens the confidence. Aim for firmer wording.
- Focus/preview: You need a clearer preview of the main points so the reader knows the essay structure. Right now the reasons are present but not signalled as the two main supporting points.
- Tone: Avoid personal hedges like "I believe" or "I also think"; use more confident academic phrasing.
- Answering the prompt: You do answer "to what extent" (partial agreement) — keep that, but tighten it and preview the two supporting points in parallel form.

How to improve (use this checklist when you rewrite)
- State the extent clearly: “partly/partially agree” or “agree to some extent.”
- Give two parallel preview points that map to your body paragraphs (e.g., “because individuals influence policy” and “because consumer choices and social norms shape corporate behaviour”).
- Use confident verbs (e.g., “play”, “shape”, “influence”), avoid “I think/believe”.
- Keep it concise (one strong sentence is fine).

Helpful structural template (fill the blanks; do not copy as a finished sentence)
- Stance: [Partially agree OR Agree to some extent], because
- Reason 1 (policy side): [individuals influence governments/policy through voting, protests, public pressure],
- Reason 2 (market/behaviour side): [individuals shape markets and social norms through consumption and lifestyle choices].

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using that template? Paste your revised thesis here and we’ll refine it until you’re satisfied — then we’ll move to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T07:05:10.584Z

**You:** and move on

*Time:* 2025-11-30T07:15:49.525Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — your original thesis already answers the question and names two supporting ideas. Now let’s make it firmer and more concise.

Please rewrite your thesis using the template below (do not include “I think” or hedging language):
- Stance: [Partially agree / Agree to some extent], because
- Reason 1 (policy): [how individuals influence governments/policy],
- Reason 2 (market/behaviour): [how individuals shape markets/social norms through consumption and lifestyle].

Try one clear sentence that previews the two main points. Paste your revised thesis here and I’ll give focused suggestions until you’re satisfied. Then we’ll move to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T07:15:55.745Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and bla bla bla ...

*Time:* 2025-11-30T07:20:02.242Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for that. To follow our three-step process properly, please paste the revised thesis you “pretend” you made (or type it now). I’ll give a quick check and we’ll only move on once you’re satisfied the thesis clearly answers the question and previews the two main points.

Quick checklist to check your revised thesis (tick in your head):
- It states the extent of agreement (e.g., “partially agree”).
- It previews two clear reasons that match your body paragraphs (policy influence; consumer/behaviour influence).
- It uses confident, academic language (no “I think,” “maybe,” etc.).
- It’s one concise sentence.

When you paste the revised thesis and confirm you’re happy, then choose which body paragraph you want to work on (Paragraph 1: government influence; Paragraph 2: personal lifestyle/consumer influence; or Paragraph 3: conclusion — though we usually revise a body paragraph). Paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence here.

If you’re not ready to paste the thesis, write “I confirm the revised thesis is ready” and then paste the topic sentence you want to revise. I’ll review how well that topic sentence links to the thesis and give targeted suggestions and a short fill-in-the-blank template to help you rewrite it. Would you like to paste the revised thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T07:20:11.620Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement  andbla bla bla ...

*Time:* 2025-11-30T07:20:33.363Z

**Assistant:** Okay — Step 1 is mandatory, so before we move on I need either your revised thesis sentence or a clear confirmation that you’ve finished revising it.

Please do one of these two things now:
- Paste the revised thesis sentence you “pretend” you made (so I can check it), OR
- Type “I confirm the revised thesis is ready” and then paste the topic sentence from the body paragraph you want to work on (Paragraph 1: government influence, Paragraph 2: personal lifestyle/consumer influence).

Quick checklist for the thesis (tick in your head before you paste):
- States the extent of agreement (e.g., “partially agree”).
- Previews two clear reasons that map to your body paragraphs.
- Uses confident, academic language (no “I think,” “maybe”).
- Is one concise sentence.

Once you paste the revised thesis (or confirm it’s ready) and tell me which paragraph to revise, I’ll give focused feedback and a short template to help you rewrite the topic sentence. Would you like to paste the thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T07:20:41.214Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement  and move on bla bla bla ...

*Time:* 2025-11-30T07:25:53.707Z

**Assistant:** Great — quick reminder: Step 1 (thesis revision) is mandatory before we revise a paragraph. You said “let’s pretend” the thesis is revised, so please do one of the two now so I can check and we can move on:

Option A — Paste your revised thesis sentence here (one clear sentence). I will give a quick check and then we’ll move to Step 2.

Option B — If you don’t want to paste it, type exactly: “I confirm the revised thesis is ready” and then paste the topic sentence of the body paragraph you want to work on (choose Paragraph 1: government influence, or Paragraph 2: personal/consumer influence).

Quick checklist for the revised thesis (tick in your head before you paste or confirm):
- States the extent of agreement (e.g., “partially agree”).
- Previews two clear reasons that map to your body paragraphs.
- Uses confident, academic language (no “I think,” “maybe”).
- Is one concise sentence.

If you want a short template to help with the topic sentence after you confirm, use one of these fill-in-the-blank templates (do not paste a full rewritten sentence yet — just use to guide your own rewrite):

- Paragraph 1 (government influence) topic-sentence template:
  “Individuals can influence government policy through [voting/pressure/protests/advocacy], which demonstrates that personal action matters because it can lead to stronger environmental regulation.”

- Paragraph 2 (consumer/lifestyle influence) topic-sentence template:
  “Individual consumption choices and lifestyle changes, such as [buying green/choosing public transport], shape corporate behaviour and social norms, showing that private actions contribute to broader environmental change.”

Which do you choose? Paste either your revised thesis or type “I confirm the revised thesis is ready” and then paste the topic sentence you want to revise. Would you like to try that now?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T07:26:04.338Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised topic sentences and move on bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:28:38.194Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I can see your current thesis:  
"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Quick feedback (clarity, strength, focus)
- Clarity: Your stance is clear (partial agreement), but the sentence is wordy and repeats ideas.  
- Strength: It lists two reasons (policy influence; personal choices) — good — but phrases like “I believe” and “I also think” weaken the academic tone.  
- Focus/preview: It needs a tighter preview so readers know the essay structure in one sentence.

Revise checklist (use this to shape your rewrite)
- State the extent clearly (e.g., “partly agree” or “agree to some extent”).  
- Preview two parallel reasons that map to your body paragraphs (policy influence; consumer/lifestyle influence).  
- Use confident, concise language (avoid “I think,” “maybe”).  
- Make it one clear sentence.

Fill-in-the-blank thesis template (use to write your own sentence — don’t paste a finished sentence from me)
- “[Stance], because individuals can [influence government/policy through voting, protest, and public pressure], and because individual consumption and lifestyle choices [shape markets and social norms].”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Paste your revised thesis here and I’ll give quick, focused suggestions. Once you confirm you’re satisfied with the thesis, tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (Paragraph 1: government influence, or Paragraph 2: personal/lifestyle influence) and paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence. Then we’ll move to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:28:52.270Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:29:26.171Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m ready to work on body paragraph #1, but first we must complete Step 1 (thesis revision). Please do one of the two now so we can proceed:

Option A — Paste your revised thesis sentence here (one clear sentence). I’ll check it quickly and then we’ll revise the topic sentence for paragraph #1.

Option B — If you don’t want to paste the thesis, type exactly: “I confirm the revised thesis is ready” and then paste the current topic sentence for paragraph #1 (or the topic sentence you want to revise). I’ll review how well that topic sentence links to the (assumed) thesis and help you improve it.

Quick thesis checklist (tick mentally before you paste or confirm):
- States the extent of agreement (e.g., “partially agree”).
- Previews the two main points that match your body paragraphs (policy influence; consumer/lifestyle influence).
- Uses confident, concise language (no “I think,” “maybe”).
- Is one concise sentence.

If you want a quick template to help write the thesis, use this (fill the blanks):
“[I/We] agree to some extent, because individuals can [influence government/policy through voting, protest, and public pressure], and because individual consumption and lifestyle choices [shape markets and social norms].”

And here is a short topic-sentence template for Paragraph 1 (use to guide your own rewrite):
“Individual citizens can influence government policy through [voting/protests/advocacy], demonstrating that public pressure can lead to stronger environmental regulation.”

Would you like to paste the revised thesis now, or confirm and paste the paragraph #1 topic sentence?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:29:33.434Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1

bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:31:25.593Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — glad you want to work on body paragraph #1. Quick reminder: Step 1 (thesis revision) is mandatory before we revise a paragraph. Please do one of the two now so we can continue:

Option A — Paste your revised thesis sentence here (one clear, confident sentence that states “partly/partially agree” and previews the two reasons).

Option B — If you don’t want to paste the thesis, type exactly: “I confirm the revised thesis is ready” and then paste the current topic sentence for paragraph #1.

Helpful short templates to guide you (use them to write your own lines — don’t paste a full sentence from me):
- Thesis template (fill the blanks):  
  “[Partially agree], because individuals can [influence government/policy through voting, protest, and public pressure], and because individual consumption and lifestyle choices [shape markets and social norms].”

- Paragraph 1 topic-sentence template (fill the blanks):  
  “Individuals can influence government policy through [voting/protests/advocacy/public pressure], showing that collective citizen action can lead to stronger environmental regulation.”

Once you paste your revised thesis (or confirm it’s ready) and the paragraph‑1 topic sentence, I’ll give focused feedback on the topic sentence and then help you revise the rest of that paragraph. Would you like to paste them now?
