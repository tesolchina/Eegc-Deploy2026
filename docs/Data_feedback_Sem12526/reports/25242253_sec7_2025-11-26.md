            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for your engagement so far. To best support your progress and meet your course requirements effectively, I recommend we now move beyond “pretend” revisions and complete the three-step revision cycle as planned:

1. **Revise your thesis statement** — please write or paste your revised thesis here, applying the guidance to clearly state your extent of agreement and preview the two channels (civic influence; personal lifestyle) with confident, specific wording.

2. **Revise the topic sentence of one body paragraph** — after you confirm your thesis, choose either the paragraph on civic/political influence or the one on personal lifestyle choices. Paste the current topic sentence or your draft so I can help you improve its clarity, focus, and alignment with your thesis.

3. **Revise the rest of that body paragraph** — once the topic sentence is set, share the paragraph so I can assist you in strengthening evidence, coherence, grammar, and vocabulary.

These steps are designed to scaffold your revision effectively and ensure tangible progress reflected in your final essay.

When you’re ready, please paste your revised thesis statement here or write it anew, aiming for a confident, specific sentence without hedging. For example (you can adapt this):

> “I partly agree that institutional actions by governments and corporations have greater impact than individual choices because citizens can pressure policy through voting, advocacy, and collective action, and personal consumption choices signal market demand and reinforce social norms, although their direct effects are smaller.”

Once you share your version, we’ll proceed together to the next step. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 19/25 - Clear stance (“I partly agree…”) and two channels (civic influence; lifestyle choices) are identified, but development is general and lacks specificity or evidence (e.g., “In some countries, people have joined together…” without naming where or what policy).
- Organization: 19/25 - Recognizable structure (introduction, two body paragraphs, conclusion) with a logical progression; however, coherence suffers due to repetition and loosely connected sentences (e.g., “But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little…” followed by “Also, sometimes people want change…”).
- Vocabulary: 17/25 - Adequate topic vocabulary (environmental laws, clean energy, plastic, carbon emissions) but much simple and imprecise phrasing (“this is problem,” “it not really enough”) reduces clarity.
- Grammar: 15/25 - Frequent errors affect clarity: subject–verb agreement and tense (“so is not always working well,” “so nothing happen,” “it not really enough”), article and preposition issues.
- Original Essay Total: 70/100

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 19/25 - The revised essay is identical to the original; no new ideas or evidence were added.
- Organization: 19/25 - Same organization; no improvements in transitions or topic focus.
- Vocabulary: 17/25 - No changes to range or precision.
- Grammar: 15/25 - The same errors remain.
- Revised Essay Total: 70/100

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- Overall Improvement: +0 points
- Key Improvements Made:
  - No observable changes in thesis, topic sentences, or body paragraph content.
  - No grammar corrections applied.
  - No added specificity or evidence.
- Missed Opportunities:
  - Revise the thesis to be assertive and clearly preview the two channels with hierarchy (e.g., “I partly agree that institutional action has greater impact overall because citizens can pressure policy, while personal choices signal market demand.”).
  - Strengthen body paragraphs with specific examples (name countries, policies, outcomes; e.g., “The UK’s plastic bag charge cut usage by X%”).
  - Correct recurring grammar issues and replace hedging/vague language with precise verbs (pressure, shape, signal, accelerate).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- Total Exchanges: 15
- Conversation Quality: The assistant provided structured guidance and scaffolds for revising the thesis, topic sentence, and a body paragraph. The student repeatedly responded with “let’s pretend we have revised…” rather than supplying actual revisions. There were no substantive questions from the student, and no iterative drafting occurred.

#### Interaction Scores:
- In-Depth Conversation: 2/5 - Although there were 15 turns, the student did not engage in in-depth questioning or provide content for revision; responses were minimal and avoided the steps.
- Critical Review of AI Suggestions: 1/5 - The student did not accept or reject suggestions with justification; no evidence of evaluating the assistant’s feedback.
- Refining Process: 1/5 - No meaningful revisions were made; no iterative cycles. The assistant prompted Step 1→Step 2→Step 3 repeatedly, but the student did not proceed.
- Human-AI Interaction Total: 4/15

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear initial stance: The introduction articulates a balanced view (“individual actions are less impactful than institutional action but still matter”), indicating awareness of the debate.
- Recognition of two channels: Identifies civic/political pressure and lifestyle/market signals as mechanisms of individual impact.
- Basic essay structure: Maintains an introduction–body–conclusion format, showing foundational organization.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Specificity and evidence: Add concrete examples and data to substantiate claims (name policies, outcomes, and contexts instead of general statements).
- Grammar and sentence control: Address recurring errors in agreement, tense, articles, and cohesion to improve clarity and credibility.
- Topic focus and cohesion: Use assertive topic sentences aligned with a revised thesis; remove redundant or unfocused sentences and add logical connectors (therefore, consequently, as a result).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Needs Improvement - The student did not provide the revised thesis or paragraph content when prompted; course task requirements were acknowledged but not acted upon.
- Strategic Planning: Needs Improvement - The assistant outlined a clear 3-step plan; the student did not follow the staged process.
- Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement - No acceptance/rejection or rationale for AI suggestions; no questions posed to clarify goals.
- Independent Editing: Needs Improvement - No actual edits were offered; repeated “pretend” responses prevented progress.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Essay writing skills: Draft an assertive one-sentence thesis that states extent and previews two channels with hierarchy. Example scaffold: “I partly agree that institutional action has greater impact than individual choices because citizens can pressure policy through voting, advocacy, and collective action, while personal consumption signals market demand and shifts norms, albeit with smaller direct effects.”
2. AI collaboration skills: Engage actively with the assistant’s prompts—paste your revised sentence(s), ask for model examples, and request line edits. Use a “revise–review–refine” loop: submit text, ask for targeted feedback (thesis strength, topic sentence clarity, grammar fixes), and then incorporate changes.
3. Overall improvement: Choose one body paragraph (e.g., civic influence) and revise it fully: craft a focused topic sentence, add one specific case (policy change with location/year and measurable outcome), improve transitions, and correct grammar. Then repeat for the second paragraph.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
The student did not complete the required revision tasks (thesis, one topic sentence, one body paragraph) despite multiple structured prompts from the assistant. The chat indicates avoidance of the revision steps (“let’s pretend…”). Consider a guided, time-boxed activity in class where the student must produce (a) one revised thesis, (b) one revised topic sentence, and (c) a 6–8 sentence paragraph with a named example. Provide sentence scaffolds and a short evidence bank (two policy cases) to lower the barrier to engagement.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:05:01.219Z

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:49:47.268Z

**You:** Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:53:52.885Z

**Assistant:** Great to work with you on this. We’ll follow the three-step revision process. First, let’s focus only on the thesis.

Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision
1) Could you confirm your current thesis? Is it this sentence:
“I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”

2) Feedback on clarity, strength, and focus:
- Clarity: “Partly agree” is clear, but specify the extent more precisely (e.g., “mostly/partly” in relation to which side has greater impact).
- Focus: Preview your two main points explicitly as the structure of your body paragraphs: (a) individuals’ civic influence on policy; (b) individual consumption/behavior shaping markets and norms.
- Strength: Remove hedging (“I believe,” “I also think”). Use assertive verbs (e.g., “shape policy,” “pressure governments,” “signal demand,” “shift markets”).
- Precision: Make the hierarchy explicit (primary impact through civic/political action; secondary but meaningful impact through lifestyle/market signals).

3) Suggested scaffolds (not full sentences):
- Position opener: “I [largely/partly] agree that __________ by governments and corporations outweigh __________ by individuals;”
- Primary point: “because citizens can __________ (e.g., shape policy through voting, advocacy, and collective pressure);”
- Secondary point: “and individual choices can __________ (e.g., signal market demand, reinforce social norms) even if their direct impact is smaller.”

4) Your turn: Would you like to try revising your thesis now using the two-part structure (primary reason + secondary reason)? Keep it confident and specific, and avoid “I think/I believe.”

Once you’re happy with your revised thesis, please share it and confirm you’re satisfied. Then we’ll move to Step 2 (choosing one body paragraph and revising its topic sentence).

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:54:12.285Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:54:29.224Z

**Assistant:** Great—we’ll follow the three-step process. First, we’ll focus only on the thesis.

Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision
1) Confirming your current thesis:
Is this your current thesis?
“I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”

2) Feedback on clarity, strength, and focus:
- Position/extent: “Partly agree” is fine, but make the extent clearer (e.g., emphasize that institutional action is more impactful overall, yet individual action is significant through specific channels).
- Preview of structure: Clearly signal your two main points: (a) individuals’ civic/political influence on policy; (b) individuals’ consumption choices shaping markets and social norms.
- Strength and precision: Remove hedging (“I believe,” “I think”). Use confident verbs like “pressure,” “shape,” “signal,” “accelerate.”
- Cohesion: Show the hierarchy: primary impact via civic pressure on governments; secondary but meaningful impact via lifestyle and market signals.

3) Helpful scaffolds (use these fragments to build your own clear, assertive thesis):
- Position opener: “I [partly/mostly] agree that actions by governments and corporations have greater impact than individual choices;”
- Primary channel: “because citizens can [pressure/shape/influence] policy through voting, advocacy, and collective action;”
- Secondary channel: “and personal consumption choices can [signal demand/shift markets/reinforce norms], even if their direct impact is smaller.”

4) Your turn:
Please write your revised thesis using the two-part structure (primary channel + secondary channel). Keep it confident and specific, and avoid “I think/I believe.”

Would you like to try revising that thesis now? Once you’re satisfied with it, confirm, and we’ll move to Step 2 (choose one body paragraph and revise its topic sentence).

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:54:43.274Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:55:23.280Z

**Assistant:** Great—thanks for moving us forward. Let’s complete Step 1 properly before we continue.

Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision
- Please paste your revised thesis now, or outline it in short phrases:
  - Position/extent: e.g., “mostly/partly agree that institutional action > individual action”
  - Primary channel: e.g., “citizens’ civic pressure shapes policy (voting, advocacy, collective action)”
  - Secondary channel: e.g., “personal choices signal market demand and shift norms (smaller but meaningful)”
- Quick checklist before you confirm:
  - Answers the essay question clearly (extent of agreement)
  - Previews your two main points (civic influence; market/norm effects)
  - Uses confident, precise verbs (pressure, shape, signal, accelerate)
  - No hedging (“I think/I believe/maybe”)

Please confirm you’re satisfied with your revised thesis. Once you do, we’ll move to Step 2.

Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision (choose one paragraph)
- Which body paragraph would you like to work on first?
  - Paragraph 1 (civic/political influence)
  - Paragraph 2 (personal lifestyle/market signals)
- Paste the current topic sentence of the chosen paragraph.
- Guidance for a stronger topic sentence:
  - Connect explicitly to the revised thesis (name the channel).
  - Be focused: one clear claim for this paragraph.
  - Use assertive, specific verbs (pressure/shape/drive/signal).
- Helpful stems (use and adapt; keep them in your style):
  - “Individuals’ greatest leverage lies in …”
  - “Through voting, advocacy, and collective action, citizens …”
  - “By …, citizens can …”
  - “As outlined in the thesis, the primary channel is …”

Would you like to try revising that topic sentence now?

Step 3 — Revising the Rest of the Chosen Paragraph
(We’ll do this after your topic sentence is set.)
- When you share the paragraph, I’ll help with:
  - Clarity: tighten vague phrases; replace hedging.
  - Unity: remove ideas that don’t support the topic sentence.
  - Coherence: improve transitions and cause–effect links.
  - Evidence: strengthen examples (who, where, what policy/effect).
- Guiding questions we’ll use:
  - “Do all supporting details directly develop the topic sentence?”
  - “Where can you add a specific example or data point?”
  - “What logical connectors will show progression (e.g., therefore, consequently, as a result)?”

Ready when you are—please send your revised thesis (or its short outline) and confirm you’re happy with it.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:55:47.854Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:58:14.677Z

**Assistant:** Wonderful—thanks for the details. Let’s stay with Step 1 first (thesis), then we’ll move to topic sentences.

Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision
1) Can you confirm your current thesis is this idea:
- “Partly agree” that governments/corporations have greater impact, but individuals still matter through influencing government and making greener lifestyle choices.

2) Focused feedback:
- Clarity: Show the extent of agreement and the hierarchy of impact (institutional > individual).
- Structure preview: Signal two channels you will develop: (a) civic/political influence on policy; (b) lifestyle/consumption shaping markets and norms.
- Strength: Remove hedging (“I think/I believe”). Use precise, assertive verbs: pressure, shape, signal, accelerate.
- Cohesion: Make the primary channel (civic influence) clearly more impactful than the secondary (market/norm effects).

3) Helpful scaffolds (fill in the blanks—no full sentence needed):
- Position/extent: “Partly agree that [institutional actions] outweigh [individual actions].”
- Primary channel: “because citizens can [pressure/shape] policy through [voting/advocacy/collective action].”
- Secondary channel: “and personal choices [signal demand/shift markets/reinforce norms], though their direct impact is [smaller/secondary].”

4) Your turn:
- Please write your revised thesis now using the two-part structure above (primary channel + secondary channel), in one confident sentence (avoid “I think/I believe”). If you prefer, share it as short phrases using the scaffolds.

Quick checklist before you confirm:
- Clearly answers “to what extent” you agree/disagree.
- Previews your two main points (civic influence; market/norm effects).
- Uses assertive verbs (pressure, shape, signal).
- No hedging language.

Once you’re satisfied with your revised thesis, say “I’m happy with this thesis.” Then we’ll go to Step 2.

Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision (we’ll do this after Step 1)
Since you said “let’s pretend we have topic sentences,” we’ll still need you to choose one body paragraph:
- Option A: Civic/political influence paragraph.
- Option B: Lifestyle/market signals paragraph.

When you choose, please paste its current topic sentence (or draft one using a stem). Helpful stems:
- “Individuals’ greatest leverage lies in [civic pressure on policy].”
- “Through [voting/advocacy/collective action], citizens [drive/shape] environmental policy.”
- “By [specific actions], citizens [influence/accelerate] government responses to climate change.”

Would you like to try revising your thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:58:32.083Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:02:06.060Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing your drafts. Let’s stick to the three-step process and start with Step 1 (thesis). We’ll move to topic sentences only after your thesis is revised and you confirm you’re happy with it.

Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision
1) Can you confirm your current thesis is this sentence:
“I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”

2) Feedback on clarity, strength, and focus:
- Extent: “partly agree” is fine—consider clarifying the hierarchy (institutional action > individual action, but individuals matter through specific channels).
- Structure preview: Clearly signal your two reasons that match your body paragraphs:
  - Civic/political influence on government policy.
  - Lifestyle/consumption choices that signal demand and shape norms/markets.
- Strength: Cut hedging like “I believe/I think.” Use assertive verbs: pressure, shape, drive, signal, accelerate.
- Precision: Show the primary vs. secondary impact (civic pressure is the main channel; lifestyle choices are smaller but meaningful).

3) Helpful scaffolds (use these fragments to build your own one-sentence thesis—no full sentence from me):
- Position/extent: “Partly/mostly agree that actions by governments and corporations have greater impact than individual choices;”
- Primary channel: “because citizens can pressure/shape policy through voting, advocacy, and collective action;”
- Secondary channel: “and personal consumption choices signal demand/shift markets and norms, even if their direct impact is smaller.”

4) Your turn:
- Please write your revised thesis now using that two-part structure (primary channel + secondary channel). Keep it confident and avoid “I think/I believe.”
- Quick checklist:
  - Answers “to what extent” you agree/disagree.
  - Previews the two main points you’ll develop.
  - Uses precise, assertive verbs.
- When you’re satisfied, say “I’m happy with this thesis,” and we’ll proceed to Step 2.

Note: We won’t “pretend” the topic sentences are revised—let’s actually do the thesis first so your topic sentence can align with it.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:02:23.618Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised one body paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:02:42.395Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing your drafts. Let’s stick to our three-step process so your revisions align with the rubric. We won’t “pretend” a paragraph is revised—first we’ll strengthen the thesis, then revise one topic sentence, and only then adjust that paragraph.

Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision
1) Could you confirm your current thesis is this sentence from your introduction:
“I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”

2) Focused feedback (to improve clarity, strength, and focus and move you toward Proficient/Excellent on the rubric):
- Extent: Make your stance precise (e.g., institutional action has greater impact overall; individual action is significant via specific channels).
- Structure preview: Signal the two pillars you’ll develop: (a) citizens’ civic/political influence on policy; (b) individuals’ consumption choices shaping markets and norms.
- Strength: Remove hedging (“I think/I believe”). Use assertive verbs: pressure, shape, drive, signal, accelerate.
- Cohesion: Show the hierarchy clearly (primary channel = civic pressure; secondary channel = lifestyle/market signals).

3) Helpful scaffolds (use these fragments to build your own one-sentence thesis—no full sentence from me):
- Position/extent: “Partly/mostly agree that actions by governments and corporations outweigh individual actions;”
- Primary channel: “because citizens can pressure/shape policy through voting, advocacy, and collective action;”
- Secondary channel: “and personal choices signal market demand and reinforce social norms, even if their direct impact is smaller.”

4) Your turn:
- Please write your revised thesis now using the two-part structure above (primary channel + secondary channel). Keep it confident and specific; avoid “I think/I believe.”
- Quick checklist:
  - Answers “to what extent” you agree/disagree.
  - Previews the two main points (civic influence; market/norm effects).
  - Uses precise, assertive verbs and parallel structure.

Would you like to try revising that thesis now? Once you’re happy with it, say “I’m satisfied with this thesis,” and we’ll move to Step 2 (choose one body paragraph and revise its topic sentence).

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:03:00.166Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the rest of the essay

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:03:24.091Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for suggesting that, but let’s not skip—your rubric rewards a clear, iterative process. We’ll stick to the three steps. First, the thesis.

Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision
- Please paste your current thesis (the one-sentence claim in your introduction). If it’s the line that begins “I partly agree…,” confirm that.
- Focused feedback you can use:
  - Extent of agreement: make the hierarchy explicit (institutional action > individual action).
  - Preview structure: name the two channels you will develop:
    - Channel 1: civic/political influence on policy (voting, advocacy, collective action).
    - Channel 2: lifestyle/consumption shaping markets and social norms (smaller but meaningful).
  - Strength: cut hedging (“I think/I believe/maybe”); use assertive verbs: pressure, shape, signal, accelerate.
  - Precision: show primary vs. secondary impact clearly.

- Quick scaffolds (use as building blocks; keep it one confident sentence):
  - Position: “partly/mostly agree that institutional actions outweigh individual actions;”
  - Primary channel: “because citizens can [pressure/shape] policy via [voting/advocacy/collective action];”
  - Secondary channel: “and personal choices [signal demand/shift markets/reinforce norms], even if direct impact is smaller.”

Would you like to try revising that thesis now? Once you’re happy, say “I’m satisfied with this thesis,” and we’ll move to Step 2.

Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision (after you confirm the thesis)
- Choose one body paragraph:
  - A: civic/political influence
  - B: lifestyle/market signals
- Paste its current topic sentence.
- Guidance to tighten it:
  - Connect explicitly to the revised thesis (name the channel).
  - One clear claim (avoid mixing channels in the same sentence).
  - Assertive verbs: pressure, drive, shape, signal.
- Helpful components to include (use as fragments):
  - Focus: “individuals’ greatest leverage = civic pressure on policy”
  - Mechanisms: “voting, advocacy, collective action”
  - Effect: “stronger environmental laws/investment in clean energy”

Step 3 — Revising the Rest of the Chosen Paragraph (we’ll do this after the topic sentence)
- When you share the paragraph, I’ll help you refine:
  - Clarity: replace vague/hedging phrases with precise ones.
  - Unity: remove sentences that don’t develop the chosen channel.
  - Coherence: add cause–effect links and transitions (therefore, consequently, as a result).
  - Evidence: specify who/where/what policy or outcome.

Quick rubric check as you revise:
- Content/Ideas: clear viewpoint + two well-defined channels.
- Organisation: thesis preview aligns with paragraph focus; logical progression.
- Vocabulary: precise verbs (pressure, shape, signal); topic terms (policy, emissions, clean energy).
- Grammar: avoid fragments/hedging; keep parallel structure.

Please share your revised thesis now. Would you like to try that revision?
