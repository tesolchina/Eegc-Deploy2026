            ## Contribution Analysis

            Based on the training assessment report and chat history, here is a concise summary and some useful next steps for you:

---

**Summary of Your Submission and Interaction:**

- You started with a clear thesis and made some good attempts to revise it with AI guidance.
- Your revised thesis in chat is more focused and previews the two main essay points:
  1. Citizens influence government policies.
  2. Individuals can adopt sustainable personal habits.
- However, these improvements were not transferred into the actual essay draft.
- No revisions were made to topic sentences, body paragraphs, vocabulary, or grammar within the essay document.
- Your interaction showed willingness to engage with AI feedback on thesis revision but was limited only to thesis and did not extend to broader essay improvements.
- The final essay draft remained unchanged, losing an opportunity to showcase your improved writing in practice.

---

**Key Recommendations:**

1. **Transfer Revised Thesis into Your Essay:**  
   Do not let your chat draft stay only in conversation. Update the thesis statement in your essay directly to reflect your clearer, more confident viewpoint.

2. **Broaden Revision Scope:**  
   After revising your thesis, revise corresponding topic sentences and at least one body paragraph. This will strengthen your essay’s organization and coherence, showing your ability to apply improvements throughout the text.

3. **Focus on Grammar and Vocabulary:**  
   Review your essay for phrase awkwardness, verb tense consistency, and word choice. Use the AI to highlight specific sentence errors and suggest improvements. Then implement those edits carefully.

4. **Engage More Critically with AI Suggestions:**  
   Don’t just accept model sentences—analyze and adapt them to your own voice and clarity. Push the conversation beyond the thesis to enhance originality and depth.

5. **Iterate Your Revisions:**  
   Write a revised draft, then review it again with AI. Write at least two rounds of revision so your writing shows measurable improvement and reflects your independent editing skills.

---

**Example Revised Thesis Sentence (for your reference):**  
“While government and corporate actions are crucial to tackling climate change, individuals still play an important role by influencing policy decisions and adopting sustainable lifestyle choices.”

Feel free to adapt this example in your essay.

- Deeper critical engagement: The student should further evaluate and customize AI suggestions for originality and clarity.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good – The student provided the thesis and essay context as requested.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement – Revision efforts were limited to thesis draft in chat and not transferred to the essay.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement – Some evidence of thought, but over-reliance on AI models without true synthesis.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement – No evidence of independently revising the essay based on feedback.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Take the improved thesis from the chat and directly revise the thesis in the essay draft.
2. Include revision of topic sentences and at least one body paragraph for comprehensive essay improvement.
3. Push for deeper discussion with the AI, questioning advice and striving to express your unique viewpoint.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
While the student demonstrates engagement in the AI revision process, none of the specified revisions have been carried out in the essay draft. Recommend requiring explicit evidence of revised thesis statement, topic sentence, and body paragraph in the essay product itself before proceeding. Further guidance on integrating chat-revised content into actual writing may be necessary.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:45:14.139Z

**You:** the problem of climate change is very serious and citizen's efforts are very important but less impactful

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:53:41.851Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement draft:  
> "the problem of climate change is very serious and citizen's efforts are very important but less impactful"

Let’s start by looking at how it meets the revision goals:

**Clarity & Focus:**  
- Your statement does mention that climate change is serious and that citizens’ efforts are important but less impactful.
- However, it doesn’t clearly answer the essay’s question or preview your key supporting points.
- Also, try to avoid starting with general facts (“the problem of climate change is very serious”); instead, focus on your argument.

**Precision & Confidence:**  
- Use confident, academic language.
- Avoid using “but” as a contrast without clearly linking both sides of your view.
- “Citizen’s” should be “citizens’” (plural possessive) if you mean efforts of all citizens.

**Previewing Structure:**  
- The thesis should show your main arguments (e.g., influencing government, personal lifestyle, relative impact).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**  
1. State your viewpoint clearly (do you agree, disagree, or partly agree that individuals’ actions do not matter much?).
2. Preview your main points:  
   Example: You believe citizens can influence government (most important), and personal green choices have a role (less impactful).

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis using these guidelines?  
Your revised thesis should:  
- Clearly answer the essay prompt about the importance of individual action vs. government/commercial action.
- Preview both *citizen influence on government* and *personal lifestyle choices* as ideas you will discuss.
- Use confident, academic language.

Go ahead and try revising it now! Let me know your updated version.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:53:48.508Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:54:47.261Z

**Assistant:** Great job! Your revised thesis is much clearer and more focused than before. It now:

- Clearly answers the prompt (“I partly agree with this idea…”).
- Explains both major points you’ll discuss (citizen influence on government and personal green choices).
- Uses more academic and confident language.

Let’s look for areas to make it even stronger:

**1. Replace “I partly agree with this idea because…”**  
- Try to state your main view confidently, rather than focusing on your agreement with “this idea.”
- Say what *you* believe, and briefly preview the structure.

**2. Make the structure of your essay even clearer**  
- Show the *order*: first, about governments; second, about personal actions.
- Use parallel phrases for the two points.

For example, notice how these model thesis patterns work [do not copy—try your own version first!]:
- “Although individual choices are less impactful than government action, citizens play a crucial role by influencing environmental policy and making personal lifestyle changes.”
- “While government and corporate action is vital in addressing climate change, individuals still make a difference both by shaping public policy and by adopting sustainable habits.”

**Your turn:**  
Would you like to try revising your thesis again, using these suggestions?  
Aim for a confident, academic tone and a clear preview of both main points. If you need a reminder or another example, let me know!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:55:04.575Z

**You:** I agree with this idea because citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, While government and corporate action is vital in addressing climate change, individuals still make a difference both by shaping public policy and by adopting sustainable habits.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:59:57.741Z

**Assistant:** Nice work! These two sentences each have some strong points, but it looks like you combined your original sentence with the model sentence. Let’s refine and focus your thesis further:

**What’s strong:**
- You explain both government influence and personal habits.
- You mention the essential role of government and companies, but also that individuals still matter.

**Areas to improve:**
- Only one sentence is needed for your thesis—this keeps it clear and focused.
- Watch for sentence structure: starting with “While …” and then showing your main point at the end is a great way to compare ideas.
- Keep your own voice—don’t just copy the model, but use it as inspiration!

Let’s try this:  
Can you rewrite your thesis as a single, confident sentence, showing:
1. Government and company actions are most important,
2. Individuals still play a role by influencing policy and through sustainable habits.

Try starting with “While…” as in the model. Would you like to give it a try now? I’m here if you need another model or a little help!
