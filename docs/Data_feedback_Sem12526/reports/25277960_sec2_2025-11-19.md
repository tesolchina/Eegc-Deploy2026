### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

**Original Essay:**  
- Demonstrated a clear position on automation positively impacting global employment.  
- Had basic development of ideas with repetition and some unclear phrasing.  
- Organization was logical but paragraph unity and transitions needed work.  
- Vocabulary and grammar were limited and sometimes incorrect.

**Revised Essay:**  
- Thesis statement improved to be clearer, more confident, and previewed the main points.  
- One body paragraph revised thoroughly, with a clearer topic sentence and more precise, academic language.  
- Vocabulary upgraded with more formal terms such as “implementation,” “workforce,” and “optimization.”  
- Grammar showed marked improvement, with better sentence structure and more accurate word forms, though minor issues persisted.  
- Conclusion rewritten to summarize arguments clearly and in an academic tone.

**Areas still to develop:**  
- Other body paragraphs received minimal revision and remain underdeveloped.  
- Vocabulary range and consistency of academic tone need further enhancement.  
- The essay would benefit from deeper critical analysis, including consideration of potential limitations or counterarguments about automation.

---

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

- The student actively engaged in a structured, coach-led revision process focusing initially on thesis statement clarity and then revising one body paragraph.  
- Responses were mostly brief and showed acceptance of guidance rather than independent critical evaluation.  
- The student asserted preference for using own ideas but did not elaborate or challenge suggestions with evidence-based reasoning.  
- There was limited visible multi-level questioning, strategic planning, or self-reflection on the AI’s input.  
- Iterations focused on selected sections only, with no systematic revision of the entire essay.

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

**Strengths:**  
- Positive attitude toward guided revision and demonstrated willingness to improve thesis clarity and paragraph structure.  
- Effective application of academic vocabulary and clearer sentence structure in revised sections.  
- Improved coherence and succinct argument presentation in thesis and one body paragraph.

**Areas for Future Growth:**  
- Develop more critical thinking by questioning AI suggestions and justifying choices based on evidence or logic.  
- Extend the revision process beyond selected sections to ensure consistent quality across the entire essay.  
- Expand lexical resource for richer vocabulary and achieve a more consistent formal style.  
- Enhance essay content with well-developed examples, explanations, and consideration of counterarguments for a balanced analysis.

**AI Collaboration Skills:**  
- Good contextual input from the student enabling targeted assistance.  
- Limited evidence of student-led strategic planning or critical review of AI feedback; mainly coach-led interaction.  
- Developing independent editing skills, with some preference for autonomy but needing stronger self-directed revision.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT

1. **Essay Writing:**  
   Systematically revise all main paragraphs using clear topic sentences and detailed support; integrate wider vocabulary and vary sentence structures; incorporate counterarguments for critical depth.

2. **Human-AI Interaction:**  
   Practice asking probing questions and provide reasoned justifications to AI suggestions; foster a more active and critical stance during revision.

3. **Revision Strategy:**  
   Adopt a comprehensive revision approach addressing the entire essay for consistency; reflect on feedback holistically and plan revision steps strategically.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES

- The student made clear, measurable progress in the clarity and academic style of thesis and one body paragraph but did not revise the entire essay.  
- Interaction was mainly coach-guided; future sessions should encourage more student initiative and critical engagement with AI input.  
- Further training recommended to develop critical evaluation, autonomous editing, and strategic revision skills.

---

**Summary:**  
The student successfully revised the thesis statement and one body paragraph, demonstrating improved academic language and argument clarity. However, fuller essay development and deeper critical engagement with AI suggestions are needed to achieve comprehensive mastery in this module.

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 – The essay presents the key argument (“automation will enhance global employment prospects”) and two main supporting ideas (creation of new jobs; improved production efficiency). However, development is basic, and some points are repeated or undeveloped.
- Organization: 18/25 – Structure follows a logical progression (introduction, body paragraphs, conclusion), but paragraphing and transitions are sometimes unclear, and supporting ideas are combined rather than separated.
- Vocabulary: 17/25 – Vocabulary is adequate but shows limited variety (“chances,” “work,” “the automation machine”), with awkward phrases and non-academic word choices.
- Grammar: 15/25 – Frequent errors in basic structures (“the automation is transforming…,” “lifes,” “the automation provide many new work”), which sometimes impede clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 70/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 22/25 – The thesis is clearer, more specific, and previews the supporting arguments; supporting ideas are better developed, though deeper critical analysis is still limited.

Task 2:
Recently, the automation is transforming industries and our daily lifes. More and more work is completed by the automation machine equipment instead of people. This inspires us to think this technological shift enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term.

In my opinion, the technological shift will enhance the global employment prospects in the long term. The main reasons I believe the perspective is that the automation provide many new work to the worker and the automation improves the efficiency of production.

In the long term, the automation will provide more new work so that the worker will have more chance to work. The automation is new thing, so it will need worker to learn how to use it, how to monitor it, and how to fix it. The whole process of using the automation to product goods creates many work chances to the people. So the automation can enhance the global employment prospects because it enhances the work chances.

And the automation improves the efficiency of production. The automation can do the work which is boring, dangerous or time-wasted, so that people can do more meaningful work and save their time. It can boost workers’ enthusiasm. For example, people can use the specific machine to do the boring work in the plant instead of doing it by themselves, so they can have more time to enjoy their lifes or find more meaningful jobs to do. In the long term, the structure of the production will be more reasonable, so the automation can enhance the global employment prospects.

All in all, the technological shift can enhance the global employment prospects. The automation can not only provide more work chances to people, but also make the production structure more reasonable. So in the long run, people will have more chances to choose meaningful work or the work they interested in. They will gain both fun and money from the work. The global employment prospects will be better due to the use of automation.

Task 2:
Recently,  automation is transforming industries and our daily lifes. More and more work is completed by automation machine equipment instead of people. This inspires us to think this technological shift enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term.

The technological shift will enhance the global employment .Because automation will improve global employment prospects in the long run by creating new types of jobs and increasing workplace efficiency.

In the long term, automation will create new types of jobs and provide more opportunities for workers in the future. The implementation of automation technologies will require workers to acquire new skills in operating, monitoring, and maintaining these systems.It generates fresh employment opportunities in these areas.Furthermore, the entire lifecycle of automated production—from system design and integration to quality control and optimization generates a wide range of employment opportunities for workers.So the automation can enhance the global employment prospects because it enhances the work chances.

And automation improves the efficiency of production.  Automation can do the work which is boring, dangerous or time-wasted, so that people can do more meaningful work and save their time. It can boost workers’ enthusiasm. For example, people can use the specific machine to do the boring work in the plant instead of doing it by themselves, so they can have more time to enjoy their lifes or find more meaningful jobs to do. In the long term, the structure of the production will be more reasonable, so  automation can enhance the global employment prospects.

In conclusion, automation can create many new jobs around the world. It makes new kinds of work and helps companies produce things better. This means people will have more chances to find jobs that are meaningful and that they enjoy. They can feel happy in their work and also earn good money. So, in the future, automation will likely be a good thing for workers everywhere.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.

*Time:* 2025-11-19T03:47:51.420Z

**You:** Now I want to revise this body paragraph   In the long term, the automation will provide more new work so that the worker will have more chance to work. The automation is new thing, so it will need worker to learn how to use it, how to monitor it, and how to fix it. The whole process of using the automation to product goods creates many work chances to the people. So the automation can enhance the global employment prospects because it enhances the work chances.

*Time:* 2025-11-19T03:48:53.003Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! You’ve chosen to focus on revising your **body paragraph** about new job opportunities created by automation. Here’s how we’ll proceed, step by step:

---

## Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision

### 1. **Your Current Topic Sentence**
> In the long term, the automation will provide more new work so that the worker will have more chance to work.

### 2. **Feedback**
- **Strengths:** You introduce the main idea (more job opportunities).
- **Areas to improve:**  
    - Use academic language: say “Automation” (no “the”) and “workers” (not “the worker”).
    - Be precise and direct. Preview what the paragraph will explain.
    - Connect clearly to your thesis: automation creates new job types.

### 3. **Guiding Question**
- **Does your topic sentence clearly summarize this reason (“creating new job opportunities”)?**
- **Does it lead the reader to expect specific details about what kinds of jobs or why they’re needed?**

### 4. **Prompt for Revision**
Would you like to try rewriting your topic sentence now? Aim for something like:

> **Automation will create new types of jobs that offer workers more opportunities in the future.**

Or try your own version!

---

## Step 3 — Revising the Rest of the Paragraph

Once you have your new topic sentence, we’ll revise the rest of the paragraph for:
- **Clarity** (each sentence easy to understand)
- **Unity** (every sentence relates to your topic sentence)
- **Development** (add explanation/examples if needed)

---

### **Your turn:**

**1. Please rewrite your topic sentence in your own words.**  
(You can use my example, or try your own style.)  

*Once you’ve posted your new topic sentence, I’ll give feedback. Then we’ll revise the rest of your paragraph together, one step at a time!*

## **Final Revised Essay**

**Task 2: Will automation improve or harm global employment prospects in the long run?**

Recently, automation is transforming industries and our daily lives. More and more work is completed by automation equipment instead of people. This technological shift inspires us to consider whether automation will enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term.

**Automation will improve global employment prospects in the long run by creating new types of jobs and increasing workplace efficiency.**

Automation will create new types of jobs that offer workers more opportunities in the future. The implementation of automation technologies will require workers to acquire new skills in operating, monitoring, and maintaining these systems, consequently generating fresh employment opportunities in these areas. Furthermore, the entire lifecycle of automated production—from system design and integration to quality control and optimization—generates a wide spectrum of employment opportunities for the workforce. Therefore, the expansion of automation not only creates new roles for workers but also improves global employment prospects in the long term.

Additionally, automation improves the efficiency of production. Automated systems can perform repetitive, dangerous, or time-consuming tasks, allowing people to focus on more meaningful work and helping companies increase productivity. This shift can boost workers’ enthusiasm, as they have more time to enjoy their lives or pursue jobs that interest them more. In the long term, production structures become more reasonable, and automation can continue to enhance global employment prospects.

In conclusion, automation can create many new jobs around the world. It makes new kinds of work and helps companies produce things better. This means people will have more chances to find jobs that are meaningful and that they enjoy. They can feel happy in their work and also earn good money. So, in the future, automation will likely be a good thing for workers everywhere.
