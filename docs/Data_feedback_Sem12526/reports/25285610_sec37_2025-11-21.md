            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for your clear instructions! Here's how we can proceed to upgrade your essay based on your priorities:

1. **Revised Thesis Statement (same idea, new style):**  
I will rewrite your thesis to sound more academic, assertive, and focused, while keeping your original position intact.

2. **Upgraded Topic Sentence:**  
I will enhance the first body paragraph’s topic sentence to make it more precise and engaging, emphasizing collective political action.

3. **Rewritten Body Paragraph:**  
I will restyle the government-influence paragraph to sound more formal and analytical, adding examples and improving coherence.

4. **Overall Essay Upgrade:**  
After the above steps, I will polish the rest of the essay (introduction, second body paragraph, and conclusion) to improve vocabulary, grammar, transitions, and flow.

---

### Step 1: Revised Thesis Statement (new style, original idea)

Here is a revised thesis that keeps your original balanced position but in a more academic style:

*“While large-scale government and corporate actions are vital to combating climate change, individual citizens hold significant influence through political engagement. Though personal lifestyle changes alone are less impactful, they contribute by shaping social norms and consumer demand. This essay argues that collective civic participation is the most effective avenue for individuals to drive environmental progress, supported by the complementary role of personal ecological responsibility.”*

Please let me know if you like this revised thesis or if you'd like me to tweak it further before I move on to Step 2 with the topic sentence.

            ---

            ## 🟤 Grading Result *(Hidden from Students)*

            Tasks check: All three tasks completed.
- Revised thesis statement: Yes — see revised thesis opening sentence in the revised essay.
- Revised one topic sentence: Yes — the first body paragraph topic sentence was rewritten.
- Revised one body paragraph: Yes — the government-influence paragraph was substantially rewritten.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The essay takes a clear position ("I partly agree...") and identifies two relevant lines of support (influencing government; personal lifestyle choices), but ideas are basic, repetitive, and sometimes vague.
- Organization: 18/25 - Paragraphing is present and logical (introduction, two body paragraphs, conclusion), but transitions and progression are simplistic and some sentences break coherence.
- Vocabulary: 17/25 - Language is generally understandable but limited and repetitive (e.g., frequent use of simple verbs and conversational phrases such as "I also think," "this is problem").
- Grammar: 16/25 - Noticeable grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that sometimes impede clarity (e.g., "the government maybe just listen a little," "so nothing happen").
- **Original Essay Total: 69/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 22/25 - The revised opening is more nuanced and analytical: it emphasizes collective political agency and positions individual lifestyle change as secondary but meaningful. It introduces concrete examples (e.g., youth-led climate strikes, climate emergency declarations). The revision shows improved argument depth, though the revised essay is truncated and not fully complete.
- Organization: 21/25 - Thesis preview and the revised topic sentence provide clearer structure and logical focus. The first body paragraph develops the civic-action angle coherently. Because the revised essay as provided is incomplete (ending mid-sentence), full organizational gains across the whole essay cannot be confirmed.
- Vocabulary: 22/25 - Academic tone is stronger and vocabulary more precise (phrases like "systemic change," "individual agency," "concentrated political power"). Word choice is more topic-appropriate and varied.
- Grammar: 21/25 - Sentences show greater syntactic complexity and correctness compared to the original. Minor polishing needed, but grammatical control is substantially improved.
- **Revised Essay Total: 86/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +17 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Stronger, more academic thesis that clarifies the argument and links the two main claims to a clear evaluative stance.
  - Upgraded topic sentence for the first body paragraph with improved focus on "collective political action" and "stringent environmental regulations."
  - Rewritten body paragraph that provides specific examples and a clearer chain of reasoning (e.g., linking strikes, voting and lobbying to policy outcomes).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The revised essay file is truncated (ends mid-sentence after "On the other hand, personal green lifestyle"), so the second body paragraph and conclusion need full revision and completion.
  - Could strengthen evidence by adding brief data or citations (e.g., statistics on emissions reductions linked to policy changes or market shifts).
  - Improve transitions between paragraphs and finish the concluding synthesis that emphasizes interaction between individual and institutional action.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 6**
  - Messages visible: assistant (welcome), user (assessment task + essay), assistant (thesis feedback), user (asks for style/topic/body changes), assistant (step 1 with guidance), user (detailed request and full draft to upgrade).
- **Conversation Quality:** Moderately productive. The assistant provided specific, actionable guidance on thesis revision and a clear three-step plan. The student gave directives for revisions but engaged in only a few back-and-forth turns, and there was limited iterative refinement recorded in the chat.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - The chat shows a developing, purposeful exchange with clear guidance and user goals, but it is short (6 messages) and lacks extended, multi-level questioning or exploration.
  - Evidence: Assistant provided stepwise thesis feedback and templates; student responded with high-level instructions but did not iterate multiple drafts in chat.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 - Developing. The student gave targeted instructions (e.g., "thesis statement is same as the original draft.but you need to change a style for me") which indicates selective acceptance and direction, but the chat contains little evidence of detailed, evidence-based acceptance/rejection of specific AI suggestions.
  - Evidence: The user directed style and scope but did not annotate or critique specific suggestions in-line; most guidance from the assistant appears to have been followed.
- **Refining Process**: 3/5 - Developing. There is evidence of at least one meaningful revision (revised thesis and first body paragraph appear in the revised essay), but the chat shows limited iterative cycles and no multiple-draft checkpoints.
  - Evidence: Assistant requested the student to try a rewritten thesis and offered to continue; the final revised text present indicates some revisions occurred, but the chat lacks repeated back-and-forth revisions.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 9/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear improvement in academic tone and argument nuance (evidence: revised thesis beginning: "While the scale of the climate crisis demands systemic change from governments and corporations, the role of the individual is often underestimated. ... individual agency is not insignificant but is most potent when channeled collectively to drive institutional action.")
- Effective use of example-based reasoning in the revised government-focused paragraph (e.g., "youth-led climate strikes... municipalities and nations to declare a climate emergency").
- Student provided clear revision goals and directives to the AI (asked specifically for thesis style change, one topic sentence upgrade, one paragraph re-style, and overall upgrade), which helped produce targeted revisions.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Complete the revision: finish the second body paragraph and the conclusion so the essay can be fully evaluated and cohesive transitions can be inserted.
- Increase critical engagement in chat: provide explicit feedback on each AI suggestion (accept/reject + reasoning) to show stronger critical review.
- Add evidence/support: include brief statistics or referenceable facts to strengthen claims (e.g., policy outcomes tied to public pressure or quantified consumer market shifts).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Good - The student provided the full original draft and clear revision instructions and course assessment criteria in the chat.
- Strategic Planning: Good - The student set explicit revision targets (thesis, topic sentence, a body paragraph, and overall upgrade).
- Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement - The chat shows directive behavior but limited detailed critical evaluation of AI suggestions.
- Independent Editing: Developing - The student indicated specific desired changes, but evidence of independent successive editing cycles in the chat is limited.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Complete the revised essay (finish the second body paragraph and conclusion) and run one more revision cycle focusing on transitions and synthesis.
2. In chat, respond to specific AI suggestions with acceptance/rejection and short justifications (e.g., "I accept this sentence but prefer X because...") to demonstrate critical review.
3. Add at least one concrete piece of evidence (statistic, brief study result, or named policy) to strengthen claims and cite it briefly in the essay for credibility.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student successfully implemented the requested revisions: a rewritten thesis, upgraded topic sentence, and a reworked body paragraph. These show clear improvement in critical thinking and academic tone.
- The revised essay provided is incomplete (truncated). Please ask the student to submit the completed revised essay so the final organizational, rhetorical, and grammatical improvements can be fully assessed.
- Encourage the student to document revision decisions in the chat (short notes like "I accepted this because..." or "I rejected X because...") to demonstrate stronger critical engagement with the AI suggestions for the AI-assistance assessment component.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:


While the scale of the climate crisis demands systemic change from governments and corporations, the role of the individual is often underestimated. A more nuanced perspective reveals that individual agency is not insignificant but is most potent when channeled collectively to drive institutional action. Therefore, although personal lifestyle adjustments contribute to a solution, the paramount power of individuals lies in their capacity to function as a political force that compels governments and markets to enact large-scale, transformative policies.
The most critical impact individuals can have is through collective political action that pressures governments to implement stringent environmental regulations. Isolated personal choices are indeed dwarfed by industrial emissions, but the collective voice of citizens—expressed through ballots, protests, and advocacy—holds the key to systemic change. For instance, widespread youth-led climate strikes across the globe have thrust the issue to the forefront of political agendas, leading some municipalities and nations to declare a climate emergency. Similarly, when constituents consistently vote for candidates with robust environmental platforms and lobby for specific legislation like carbon taxes or renewable energy investments, they create an imperative for politicians to act. This form of civic engagement translates diffuse personal concern into concentrated political power, making it the most effective lever available to the public.

On the other hand, personal green lifestyle

**Assistant:** Thanks — I can see your current thesis in the draft. Let’s work through Step 1 now.

Step 1 — Feedback on your current thesis
Current thesis (from your draft):
"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

What’s good:
- It answers the question by taking a clear position (partial agreement).
- It mentions the two main points you discuss: citizens influencing government and personal lifestyle choices.

How to make it stronger:
- Be more precise about the extent of your agreement (avoid vague phrases like “partly agree” without clarifying what that means).
- Preview the essay’s structure more clearly and briefly: say which point is stronger or more important.
- Use confident, academic language and avoid conversational wording (“I also think…” or “while less impactful” is okay but could be sharper).
- Remove hedging language (“maybe,” “I think”) and tighten the sentence so it clearly states your stance and the two supporting reasons.

Suggested thesis template (use this to rewrite — do not copy as a full sentence from me):
- [Clear position: extent of agreement]. Because [reason 1 — e.g., citizens can influence government policy], and [reason 2 — e.g., individual lifestyle changes can contribute and create market signals], [brief evaluative phrase about relative impact or need for cooperation].

Helpful phrase-level suggestions you can use when rewriting:
- Replace “I partly agree” with “I agree to some extent” or “I acknowledge that… while also arguing that…”
- Use linking phrases: “because,” “while,” “however,” “and”
- End with a clear preview: “(this essay will explain how X and Y contribute to combating climate change).”

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using that template? Paste your revised version when you’re ready, and we’ll confirm it before moving to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-21T14:56:40.427Z

**You:** so first,my thesis statement is same as the original draft.but you need to change a style for me.second,the topic sentence need to be upgrade.third,i want you to change a body paragraph into another style different from the original one.last,you need to upgrade all the essay

*Time:* 2025-11-21T15:01:17.385Z

**Assistant:** Great — we’ll follow the three-step revision process you described. I’ll guide you step by step. First, Step 1: the thesis.

1) I have your current thesis (from your draft):
"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Feedback on clarity, strength, and focus
- Strengths: It takes a clear position (partial agreement) and mentions the two supporting ideas you use in the essay (influencing government; personal lifestyle choices).
- Problems to fix:
  - Vague wording: “partly agree” and “I also think” are conversational and weak for academic writing.
  - Lacks a clear evaluative stance about relative importance (which is stronger? why?).
  - Wordy and repetitive (e.g., “which is very important” and “at the same time”).
  - Needs a brief preview of how your essay will support the claim.

How to revise (do not copy a full sentence from me)
- Aim for: a clear statement of the extent of your agreement + two short reasons + a brief evaluative phrase showing which is more influential or how they interact.
- Use confident, academic language and avoid hedging (no “I think,” “maybe,” “partly” without qualification).
- Useful phrase fragments you can combine into your own thesis:
  - “I agree to some extent…”
  - “because citizens can influence policy through voting, protests, and public pressure…”
  - “while individual lifestyle changes signal consumer demand and help build social norms…”
  - “however, government action and corporate regulation remain decisive for large-scale emissions reduction.”
  - “This essay argues that… and …”

Try this now
Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using those fragments and the template suggestions? Paste one revised thesis sentence you write, and I’ll give focused feedback and ask you to confirm you’re satisfied before we move to Step 2.

Note on scope
Remember: in this session I’ll only help revise the thesis, one topic sentence (you choose which paragraph), and the rest of that one paragraph. If you want the whole essay revised after we finish these steps, we can continue in another round. Which body paragraph would you like to revise later (paragraph about influencing government, or the paragraph about individual lifestyle changes)?
