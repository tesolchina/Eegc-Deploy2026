            ## Contribution Analysis

            It looks like you have been working on strengthening the thesis and main ideas around automation’s impact on employment. Based on your drafts and the assessment report, here are some tailored suggestions and next steps to help finalize your revised essay and your human-AI collaboration skills:

---

**Key Actions for Your Essay Revision:**

1. **Remove Duplicate Paragraphs**  
   Your revised essay currently repeats the same body paragraphs several times. Please consolidate these repeated sections into one clear, well-organized version to improve coherence and readability.

2. **Improve Clarity and Grammar**  
   Carefully proofread your essay to fix spelling mistakes (e.g., “technolosical,” “Doos,” “fomp”) and grammatical errors. Consider reading aloud or using grammar-check tools to catch awkward phrasing and improve sentence flow.

3. **Strengthen Thesis Statement**  
   Based on your last thesis draft, here’s a clearer and more concise example you might consider or adapt to suit your voice:  
   *“Automation ultimately undermines global employment prospects because it displaces routine jobs, though it cannot replace complex creative work; therefore, effective reskilling initiatives are essential to mitigate job loss.”*  
   Make sure your thesis previews main points clearly and confidently.

4. **Add Specific Evidence**  
   To increase the persuasive power of your essay, incorporate concrete data or references such as recent statistics on automation and unemployment, or names of studies/policies from credible sources. This will enrich your content and ideas score.

5. **Use Stronger Transitions**  
   Work on linking your ideas smoothly between sentences and paragraphs to avoid repetition and to guide the reader logically through your argument.

---

**Suggestions to Improve Future Human-AI Interaction:**

- When the AI offers multiple thesis options or suggestions, try explicitly evaluating each (e.g., “I like option A because… but I worry about…,” or “I prefer B as it fits my argument better.”) This shows deeper critical engagement.
- Ask the AI to help with sentence-level editing, transitions, or to summarize your paragraphs to check coherence before revising.
- Request an explicit revision checklist early on to guide your multiple rounds of essay improvement beyond just the thesis.
- Take time to independently proofread and edit to catch repeated content or mechanical errors.

---

**Optional Support I Can Provide Now:**

- Produce a cleaned, consolidated version of your revised essay with duplicates removed, grammar corrected, and stronger transitions added.  
- Generate a step-by-step revision checklist to guide your final polishing process.  

Just let me know which you prefer! This will help you submit a well-organized and polished final draft that reflects your learning and constructive use of AI assistance.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The original draft presents a clear position (individual actions partly matter) and relevant ideas (influence on government, personal green habits) but lacks depth and supporting evidence.
- Organization: 19/25 - The essay has an obvious structure (introduction, two body paragraphs, conclusion) but contains repetitive points and weak transitions.
- Vocabulary: 17/25 - Vocabulary is adequate for the topic but basic and sometimes imprecise (e.g., “maybe,” “a lot”), limiting precision.
- Grammar: 15/25 - Understandable overall, but frequent grammar and sentence-level errors reduce clarity (e.g., “so is not always working well,” “nothing happen”).
- **Original Essay Total: 71/100**

Evidence: Thesis from original — “Climate change is a very serious problem... I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government... personal green lifestyle choices... still have a role to play.” Body example: describes protests and voting as influence on policy.

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised essay takes a clear position that automation will increase unemployment long-term and recognizes limits to automation (complex creative tasks). It adds concrete industry examples (BMW, Xiaomi) and emphasizes reskilling. Greater topical relevance for the new prompt is evident.
- Organization: 16/25 - Organization is weakened by repeated paragraphs and redundant passages (the same three-paragraph block is duplicated multiple times). When condensed, the logical flow would be stronger, but current repetition harms coherence.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Uses stronger and more topic-relevant vocabulary (automation, productivity, accuracy, cognitive tasks), though some word choice errors remain.
- Grammar: 17/25 - Several sentences are clear and improved, but spelling errors and awkward phrasing persist; the repeated blocks suggest insufficient proofreading.
- **Revised Essay Total: 74/100**

Evidence: Thesis in revised essay — “From my perspective, while this technological advancement offers economic benefits, it will inevitably lead to rising unemployment rates in the long term.” Topic sentence example — “Automation acts as a relentless engine for boosting productivity and slashing costs.” Body evidence includes: “For instance, automotive giants like BMW and Xiaomi now utilize advanced automation for assembly instead of traditional workers.”

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +3 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clearer, more assertive thesis addressing the new topic (automation and employment).
  - Inclusion of concrete examples (BMW, Xiaomi) and clearer explanation of why automation displaces routine work (24-hour operation, accuracy).
  - A stronger treatment of the counterpoint that some complex tasks remain hard to automate and the implication that reskilling is necessary.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Remove duplicated paragraphs and consolidate content for much better organization and readability.
  - Add specific evidence (statistics, recent studies, or policy examples) to support claims about employment impacts.
  - Strengthen grammar, spelling, and sentence-level editing to improve clarity and academic tone.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 11**
- **Conversation Quality:** Iterative, scaffolded interaction focused primarily on crafting a stronger thesis statement for the new topic. The assistant provided clear guidance (checklist, building blocks), and the student submitted multiple drafts and incorporated feedback. Interaction concentrated on thesis and initial paragraph-level drafting rather than full essay polishing.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - The chat contains a moderate number of exchanges (11) and shows a focused back-and-forth on thesis development. Depth is developing: exchanges probe thesis clarity and drafting, but discussion did not extend deeply into full-paragraph restructuring, evidence-gathering, or multiple rounds of holistic revision.
  - Evidence: Assistant prompted for a thesis checklist and requested a 1–2 sentence thesis; student produced several attempts (e.g., “With automation becoming better and better, this technolosical shift ultimately undermine slobal employment...”).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 - The student accepted most of the assistant’s guidance and revised drafts accordingly. There is some evidence of the student selecting and adapting fragments offered by the assistant, but limited explicit critique or rejection of AI suggestions.
  - Evidence: Student followed the assistant’s advice to take a clear position and preview reasons, producing successive thesis drafts rather than challenging the assistant’s advice.
- **Refining Process**: 4/5 - There is clear iteration: the student produced multiple thesis drafts, the assistant provided targeted feedback each time, and the student refined wording and content. However, iteration appears concentrated on the thesis rather than multiple full-essay revision cycles.
  - Evidence: Chat shows at least three distinct thesis drafts and assistant feedback cycles; the revised essay reflects the thesis and topic-sentence guidance from the chat.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 10/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear engagement with the assistant’s scaffolded instructions (e.g., used the checklist and building fragments to form a thesis).
- Moved successfully to a new essay topic and produced a coherent position with supporting examples (BMW, Xiaomi).
- Demonstrated iterative revision: multiple drafts and acceptance of feedback show positive use of AI assistance.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Eliminate duplicate content and perform a final consolidation/proofreading pass to improve organization and readability.
- Incorporate concrete data or citations to support claims about job losses and sectoral impacts.
- Improve spelling, grammar, and sentence structure; focus on academic register and clearer transitions.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student supplied the new topic and initial drafts; assistant had enough context to give focused guidance (evidence: “change topic to this one: Automation is transforming industries…”).
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The assistant provided a clear plan (thesis checklist, stepwise revision), and the student followed a thesis-first approach.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement to Developing - The student largely accepted suggestions instead of explicitly evaluating alternatives; more explicit critique of AI recommendations would strengthen learning.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The revised essay still shows duplicated text and mechanical errors, indicating more independent proofreading and editing is needed.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Consolidate and proofread: Remove repeated paragraphs, then perform a careful pass for spelling and grammar (consider using spell-check + one manual read-through).
2. Add evidence: Support claims with statistics or named reports (e.g., studies on automation and employment) and include a stronger policy/solution paragraph describing reskilling measures or regulation.
3. Deepen AI collaboration: In future chats, ask the AI for alternative thesis options, request suggested sentence-level edits, and explicitly evaluate which AI suggestions to accept or reject to show critical engagement.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student changed topic between the original and revised essays (climate change → automation). This is acceptable when requested but requires the instructor to treat the revised essay as a new-topic submission.
- The student engaged productively with AI guidance on thesis construction, but the final revised essay contains verbatim repetition of the same blocks of text (the same three paragraphs are duplicated several times). Please advise the student to consolidate and proofread before final submission.
- Encourage the student to show more explicit critical thinking in chat (e.g., state reasons for accepting/rejecting AI suggestions) and to expand revision cycles beyond the thesis to full-paragraph and whole-essay structure revisions.

If you would like, I can:
- Produce a cleaned, consolidated version of the revised essay (remove duplicates, correct grammar, tighten structure), or
- Generate a revision checklist the student can follow to finalize the essay and chat evidence of iterative edits.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
In the contemporary era, AI tools are increasingly permeating the workforce, fundamentally changing how businesses operate. As companies strive to maximize efficiency in this fast-paced society, manual labor is being rapidly displaced. From my perspective, while this technological advancement offers economic benefits, it will inevitably lead to rising unemployment rates in the long term.
Automation acts as a relentless engine for boosting productivity and slashing costs. As the adage goes, "time is money." Consequently, major industries are shifting away from human reliance. For instance, automotive giants like BMW and Xiaomi now utilize advanced automation for assembly instead of traditional workers. Unlike humans, machines can operate 24 hours a day with impeccable accuracy. They do not suffer from fatigue, nor do they require breaks or holidays. Therefore, to avoid the limitations and costs associated with human employees, companies are prioritizing machines to ensure continuous, high-quality output.

This trend is not limited to car manufacturing; it is expanding into the food, water, and textile industries. The universal motivation for these sectors is to reduce operational expenses and increase profit margins simultaneously.

However, while this shift undermines global employment in the sector of routine labor, it has limits. Automation primarily replaces repetitive, "easy" work, yet it struggles to replicate complex tasks that require human creativity, such as inventing new products or improving AI systems. Ultimately, to survive this transition, we must study harder and acquire advanced skills. By focusing on difficult, cognitive tasks that machines cannot perform, we can prevent automation from taking our jobs.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-22T02:49:40.219Z

**You:** change topic to this one: Automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. Does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term?
Write no fewer than 250 words.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T02:54:14.178Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m ready to help you revise this essay step by step. First, we need a clear thesis for the new topic: “Automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. Does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term?”

Step 1 — Thesis statement
1) Please share your current thesis statement for this new topic. If you don’t have one yet, try to write a short draft now (one or two sentences).

2) While you write or paste it, use this checklist to make the thesis strong:
- Take a clear position (enhances / undermines / partially both) — don’t be neutral or say “I think.”
- Preview the main reasons or structure you will discuss (e.g., short-term displacement, long-term job creation in new sectors, role of policy and reskilling).
- Use confident, precise language (avoid “maybe,” “probably,” “can,” unless you qualify them).
- Keep it specific and focused — avoid vague phrasing like “a lot” or “many.”

3) If it helps, here are example building blocks (not full sentences) you can use to shape your thesis:
- Position indicator: “ultimately enhances,” “ultimately undermines,” or “offers mixed outcomes, improving prospects only if…”
- Main points to preview: “short-term job displacement,” “long-term creation of new industries and roles,” “importance of education/reskilling and policy.”

Please paste your current thesis or a quick draft now. After you post it, I’ll give focused feedback on clarity, strength, and how well it previews your essay. Once you’re happy with the revised thesis, we’ll move to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T02:54:36.328Z

**You:** Nowadays, with At tools increasingly replace some people's work and every company wants to employ better person, It leads to a fast-paced society and causes many unemployment. From my point of ten I think automation will cause more and more unemployment in the long term.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T02:58:51.886Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a good start. I’ll give quick, clear feedback so you can improve the thesis.

What’s strong about your draft
- You take a position (automation will cause unemployment).
- You show the idea is about long-term effects.

What needs improvement
- Clarity and grammar: phrases like “At tools,” “from my point of ten,” and “causes many unemployment” are unclear or incorrect. Fixing these will make your meaning stronger.
- Strength and precision: avoid “I think” and weak phrasing. Make a confident claim (e.g., “undermines,” “enhances,” or “offers mixed outcomes”).
- Focus and preview: your thesis does not preview the main reasons or structure you will discuss. A strong thesis should indicate the main points (for example: short-term displacement, long-term job creation in new sectors, and the role of policy/reskilling).

How to revise (do not copy a full sentence from me — use these building blocks)
- Choose one clear position: ultimately undermines / ultimately enhances / offers mixed outcomes (conditional).
- Use a three-part preview: short-term displacement; long-term creation of new jobs or industries (or lack of them); and the role of policy/reskilling in shaping outcomes.
- Structure to follow: Position + because + 2–3 preview reasons.

Helpful fragments you can combine (choose and adapt)
- “short-term job displacement”
- “long-term creation of new industries and roles”
- “only if governments and firms invest in education and reskilling”
- “ultimately undermines employment prospects”
- “ultimately enhances employment prospects”
- “offers mixed outcomes, improving prospects only when…”

Now your turn
Please rewrite your thesis in one or two confident sentences using the checklist above and those fragments. When you post it, I’ll give focused feedback on clarity, strength, and whether it previews your essay. Once you’re happy with the thesis, we’ll move to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T02:59:12.404Z

**You:** Automation just like a machine.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T03:05:58.803Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — that short line is a start, but it isn’t yet a thesis. Quick, supportive feedback:

What’s missing
- Clarity: “Automation just like a machine.” is vague and unclear.
- Position: it doesn’t state whether automation ultimately enhances, undermines, or has mixed effects on employment.
- Preview of reasons/structure: it doesn’t say which main points you will discuss (short-term displacement, new jobs, role of policy/reskilling, etc.).
- Tone: it isn’t a confident, academic sentence.

How to fix it (do not copy a full sentence from me — use these fragments to build your own)
- Choose one clear position: “ultimately undermines,” “ultimately enhances,” or “offers mixed outcomes.”
- Preview 2–3 main reasons: e.g., “short‑term job displacement,” “creation of new industries and roles,” “dependence on government and corporate reskilling policies.”
- Use confident language and link position to reasons: “because…”, “unless…”, or “only if…”.

Useful fragments to combine
- “ultimately undermines employment prospects”
- “ultimately enhances long‑term employment”
- “offers mixed outcomes, improving prospects only if governments and firms invest in education and reskilling”
- “because of short‑term displacement, the uncertain scale of new job creation, and the crucial role of policy”
- “by creating new industries and roles while displacing routine work”

Quick checklist before you post your revision
- Does it take a clear position (no “I think”)?
- Does it preview the main points you will discuss?
- Is it one or two concise sentences?

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now? Paste your new one when you’re ready. If you want help choosing a position, tell me which angle you prefer (undermines / enhances / mixed) and I’ll give targeted guidance.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T03:06:11.123Z

**You:** Automation just like a machme. it can boast effiency and recue cost Time is money in this fast-paced society. Many car fomp Industry around the
world
ware use automation method to build instead of human, like BM, Xiao Mi and soon. m Machine can keep working 24h and have a high accuracy i so the quavity we don't have to worry about, but human can't work 24n and they must have time want to relax. so company has to deal with
human probems.
More and more industry use automation to build produce
not just car indusem. such Such as food industry, water industry, clothes industin and so on, they all want to reduce cost and improve eniency, so they use antomation method instead of human, so they can earn more money at the same time.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T03:08:56.319Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a helpful draft to work from. First, quick, encouraging feedback on your current thesis and what to fix before you rewrite it.

What’s good
- You show the main idea: automation increases efficiency and reduces jobs.
- You give some examples (car industry, companies) that show you understand the topic.

What needs improvement
- Clarity and grammar: several sentences are unclear and contain errors (e.g., “Automation just like a machme,” “boast effiency,” “recu cost”).
- Position: your thesis doesn’t clearly state whether automation ultimately undermines, enhances, or produces mixed effects on employment. You must take one clear position.
- Preview: the thesis does not preview the main reasons or structure you will discuss (for example: short-term displacement, creation of new jobs, and the role of policy/reskilling).
- Tone: avoid first-person hedging (“from my perspective,” “I think”) — use confident academic language.

How to revise (do not copy a full sentence from me — use these fragments to build your own)
- Choose one clear position: ultimately undermines / ultimately enhances / offers mixed outcomes (only if…).
- Preview 2–3 reasons you will discuss, e.g.:
  - short-term job displacement,
  - long-term creation of new industries and roles (or limited new jobs),
  - the crucial role of government and corporate policy, education, and reskilling.
- Use a structure: Position + because/although/only if + brief preview of reasons.
- Keep it 1–2 concise sentences and use confident language (no “maybe,” “I think”).

Helpful fragments you can combine (pick and adapt)
- “ultimately undermines employment prospects”
- “ultimately enhances long-term employment”
- “offers mixed outcomes, improving prospects only if governments and firms invest in reskilling”
- “because of short-term displacement, uncertain job creation, and the role of policy”
- “by increasing efficiency while displacing routine work”

Quick checklist before you post your revision
- Do you take a clear position (no “I think”)?
- Do you preview the main points/structure you will discuss?

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now? Paste your new version (1–2 sentences). If you want help choosing a position (undermine / enhance / mixed), tell me which angle you prefer and I’ll give focused guidance.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T03:09:12.783Z

**You:** With automation becoming better and better, this technolosical shift
ultimately undermine slobal employment, but automation just replace easy work, it still can't replace some difficult work such as creating new product, improvins AL's ability to deal with mate difticult problems and so on. We have to study harder to prevent automation replace
our Doos.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T03:09:58.116Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a solid effort and I can see your ideas. Quick, encouraging feedback and a clear next step.

What’s strong
- You recognise both displacement of routine jobs and the idea that some complex tasks remain hard to automate.
- You try to argue a clear outcome (undermine employment).

What to improve (focus this revision on these)
- Clarity and grammar: several phrases are unclear or misspelled (e.g., “technolosical,” “undermine slobal,” “Doos”). Clean, simple wording will help the reader.
- Clear position: decide whether automation “ultimately undermines,” “ultimately enhances,” or “offers mixed outcomes.” Don’t use “I think.”
- Preview of structure: include 2–3 reasons you will discuss (for example: short-term displacement of routine work; limited replacement of complex creative/problem-solving roles; and the importance of reskilling and policy).
- Concision: keep it to one or two confident sentences.

Useful building blocks you can combine (do not copy a full sentence from me — pick fragments and assemble them)
- Position indicators: “ultimately undermines employment,” “ultimately enhances long‑term employment,” “offers mixed outcomes, improving prospects only if…”
- Reasons/preview phrases: “because of short‑term displacement of routine jobs,” “because automation cannot fully replace complex creative and problem‑solving work,” “unless governments and firms invest in reskilling and policy,” “by creating new industries and roles”
- Linking language: “because,” “unless,” “only if,” “while,” “therefore”

Quick checklist before you post the revision
- One or two sentences
- Clear, confident position (no “I think”)
- 2–3 preview reasons or signpost of structure
- Clear wording and correct spelling

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now? Paste your revised thesis (1–2 sentences). Once you’re happy with it, I’ll confirm and then we’ll move on to Step 2 (pick a body paragraph to revise).
