            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for sharing the detailed assessment and the chat history!

Since you’ve completed all three revision tasks (thesis, topic sentence, and body paragraph 1) with clear improvement, and you asked most recently for step 3 (paragraph revision) plus a model paragraph rewrite, I’ll focus on a summary of your progress plus tailored next steps to help you keep improving.

---

### Summary of Your Progress
- **Thesis statement**: You worked hard to make it clearer and stronger, removing hedging and explicitly previewing your reasons.
- **Topic sentence (Paragraph 1)**: You replaced the weak original sentence with a clear one connecting automation-driven productivity increases to job losses.
- **Paragraph 1 revision**: You accepted and adapted a model paragraph that explains the mechanism, adds examples, and improves grammar and clarity.
- **Grammar improvement**: Noticeable progress especially in Paragraph 1 and thesis—articles, plurals, verb forms improved. Some recurring issues remain in Paragraph 2 and the conclusion.

You’ve done a great job engaging with the stepwise plan, revising multiple drafts, and accepting targeted AI guidance while also making your own edits.

---

### Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Paragraph 2 Revision (Targeted Grammar + Development)**
   - Paragraph 2 contains grammar errors and underdeveloped reasoning.
   - Suggested approach: Paste 2-3 sentences from Paragraph 2 here; I will give you short, targeted grammar and clarity corrections.
   - Practice rewriting those sentences yourself using my hints. This approach reinforces your editing skills.

2. **Conclusion Revision**
   - Like Paragraph 2, the conclusion repeats points without strong synthesis or nuance.
   - When ready, try to rewrite the conclusion sentence focusing on summarizing your position without repetition.
   - I can provide models and practice sentences.

3. **Grammar Focused Sentence Pass**
   - After upgrading Paragraph 2 and conclusion content, do a final sentence-level grammar pass on the whole essay.
   - Target articles, subject-verb agreement, pluralization, prepositions.
   - Regular short practice (10-15 mins daily) with sentence correction exercises is recommended.

4. **Add Evidence/Examples**
   - To strengthen your argument, add at least one specific sector example or brief statistic in Paragraph 2.
   - Also consider mentioning possible mitigation policies (e.g., retraining), even briefly, to show nuanced understanding.

5. **Critical Engagement with AI Suggestions**
   - When edits are suggested, try asking for alternatives or explaining why you prefer one option.
   - This will build deeper revision skills and autonomy.

---

### Would you like to start with:  
– A short interactive revision of 2-3 sentences from Paragraph 2 (I give pointed grammar and clarity tips, you revise)?  
OR  
– Rewriting the conclusion now for improved clarity and impact?  
OR  
– Another option you prefer?

Just let me know which next step fits your goals best! I’m here to guide you through whichever part you want to tackle next.

            ---

            ## 🟤 Grading Result *(Hidden from Students)*

            All three tasks were completed:
- Revised the thesis statement — completed (student produced multiple revised thesis versions; final working thesis used in revisions).
- Revised one of the topic sentences — completed (“By greatly increasing productivity, automation often replaces routine jobs and reduces demand for labour.”).
- Revised one of the body paragraphs — completed (Body Paragraph 1 was revised with clearer explanation and example).

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The original draft had a clear position (arguing automation undermines employment) and relevant reasons (productivity, cost-cutting). However ideas were repetitive and underdeveloped; claims lacked concrete examples or precise explanation. Evidence: original thesis “In my view, I think it may undermine global employment prospects in long run.” and repetitive claims such as “it can boost efficiency, faster than human in more than 1 times.”
- Organization: 17/25 - The essay had a recognizable structure (intro, body paragraphs, conclusion) but weak topic sentences and poor transitions. Paragraph unity was limited. Evidence: first topic sentence (“To start with, automation can enhance productivity and efficiency.”) does not link directly back to the thesis.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Vocabulary was basic and often imprecise. Word-choice errors and non-native phrasing reduce clarity (e.g., “labour is varble,” “no rest in duration,” “faster than human in more than 1 times”).
- Grammar: 15/25 - Frequent sentence-level errors (articles, pluralization, verb forms) that sometimes impede clarity. Examples: “the employee cannot keep working in a long time,” “company will no longer to hire people,” “The profit will be happened.”
- **Original Essay Total: 65/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised essay makes the central argument clearer and adds an explicit mechanism linking productivity gains to job loss. Paragraph 1 includes a concrete example (“factory robots… self‑service checkouts”). Still, the later paragraph(s) remain underdeveloped and repetitious; stronger evidence or data would raise this further.
- Organization: 21/25 - Organization improved: the revised topic sentence for Paragraph 1 links to the thesis, and the paragraph develops a clear mechanism-consequence chain. However, transitions and paragraph topic clarity in Paragraph 2 and the conclusion still need work.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Vocabulary and phrasing improved in the revised paragraph (e.g., “operate continuously,” “far faster and more reliably”), but elsewhere there remain awkward collocations and repeated phrases (some retained errors in later paragraphs).
- Grammar: 19/25 - Significant improvement in Paragraph 1 and the thesis (correct pluralization, verb forms, articles). Some sentences in Paragraph 2 and the conclusion still show grammatical errors and awkward constructions (e.g., “The revenue that automation brings to the company higher than the cost it brings,” “The company will keep adopt it”).
- **Revised Essay Total: 81/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +16 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis revision: more direct, previewing reasons in a single sentence (e.g., “Automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long run because the rising productivity from automation will replace routine labour and encourage firms to cut labour costs to raise profits.”).
  - Topic sentence and paragraph unity: Topic sentence revised to directly connect productivity gains to reduced labour demand (“By greatly increasing productivity, automation often replaces routine jobs and reduces demand for labour.”).
  - Paragraph development and clarity: Paragraph 1 was rewritten to explain the mechanism, add a brief example (“factory robots… self‑service checkouts”), and end with a clear consequence sentence tying back to the thesis.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Paragraph 2 and conclusion still need significant revision: they contain grammar issues and repeat the same points without stronger evidence or elaboration (e.g., costs vs. benefits discussion is asserted but not supported).
  - Evidence and nuance: The essay would be stronger with a specific example, short statistic, or more nuanced discussion of which sectors/jobs are most affected and potential mitigating policies (retraining, social safety nets).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 25**
- **Conversation Quality:** The chat shows a sustained, stepwise collaboration. The assistant established a three-step revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph). The student engaged, tried multiple rewrites, and accepted guided models. Interaction included targeted prompts, student-produced drafts, and iterative feedback.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 4/5 - The chat contains many exchanges (25 messages) and a structured revision process. The student followed multi-step guidance and produced multiple drafts. It falls short of a full “excellent” because the student asked few exploratory or high-level critical questions (the conversation was largely task-focused and procedural rather than deeply analytical).
  - Evidence: Assistant’s initial plan and step-by-step guidance (assistant: “Step 1: Revise your thesis statement. Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence. Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph...”). The student iterated the thesis and paragraph as directed.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 - The student accepted most AI suggestions and followed the assistant’s models, and they made independent edits (e.g., produced their own thesis and topic sentence). However, there is limited explicit critical evaluation or rejection of AI suggestions — the student largely accepted and implemented guidance rather than challenging or justifying alternative choices.
  - Evidence: Student repeatedly used assistant frames and accepted the model paragraph (“Yes. Just keep it. By greatly increasing productivity...”) and chose the assistant’s model option (“B”) rather than pushing back with alternative arguments.
- **Refining Process**: 4/5 - There is a clear iterative process with multiple revisions: the student produced several thesis drafts, a revised topic sentence, and multiple paragraph drafts; the assistant provided models and corrective edits. This demonstrates a robust revision cycle, though not an extensive series of independent re-analyses at each step.
  - Evidence: Iterations visible in chat — student’s first revision (“Automation will undermine...”), follow-up refinements, then acceptance of topic sentence and paragraph rewrites, and student-provided paragraph which the assistant refined.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 11/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear central argument and ability to restate it more forcefully after guidance (evidence: final working thesis).
- Effective uptake of targeted feedback: student implemented structural advice (new topic sentence) and incorporated an example into Paragraph 1.
- Willingness to iterate: multiple drafts and acceptance of staged revision plan show disciplined revision behavior (25 chat exchanges; several draft submissions).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Sentence-level accuracy across the full essay: continue drilling grammar (articles, verb agreement, plural forms). Recommendation: complete a focused grammar pass on Paragraph 2 and conclusion.
- Development and evidence: add data, concrete sector examples, or brief citations to strengthen arguments beyond general claims.
- Critical engagement with AI suggestions: ask more probing questions (e.g., “Does this wording weaken my claim?” or “Can you suggest a counterargument and how to respond?”) to deepen revision strategy.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the draft and accepted the assistant’s stepwise plan; the assistant had enough context to proceed. Evidence: student pasted full thesis and paragraphs and confirmed targets.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student followed a clear plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) and stuck to the sequence, enabling focused improvements.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement to Developing - The student implemented many suggestions but did not often critique or justify alternative AI recommendations; more explicit assessment and selective acceptance/rejection would improve learning.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The student produced multiple independent revisions (crafted their own thesis, topic sentence, and a paragraph draft) before accepting model edits.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Do a targeted grammar pass across Paragraph 2 and the conclusion: focus on article use, pluralization, and subject-verb agreement. Suggested practice: 10–15 minutes per day of focused sentence correction exercises.
2. Strengthen evidence and nuance: add one concrete example or a short statistic to Paragraph 2 (e.g., a sector example or a citation) and briefly discuss counterarguments and mitigation (retraining, policy) to show sophistication.
3. Increase critical engagement with AI: when the assistant proposes changes, ask for 1–2 alternatives and explain why you accept or reject them. This deepens your evaluative skills and supports independent editing.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student responded well to structured guidance and showed measurable improvement in clarity and organization, particularly in Paragraph 1 and the thesis area.
- Remaining issues are concentrated in Paragraph 2 and the conclusion; these should be targeted in follow-up sessions with focused grammar checks and development of evidence.
- The student would benefit from explicit instruction/practice on critical use of AI suggestions — encourage them to evaluate suggestions, not just accept them, to build autonomous revision skills.

If you would like, I can:
- Provide a line-by-line grammar pass for Paragraph 2 and the conclusion (with brief explanations), or
- Offer 2–3 model sentences to replace the weakest lines in Paragraph 2 so the student can practice copying and adapting them.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Nowadays, automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. Some people think that this technological shift enhance global employment prospects, while others argue that it may undermine global employment prospects in long run. In my view, I think it may undermine global employment prospects in long run. The reasons are as follows:

To start with, automation can enhance productivity and efficiency. In the past, the employee cannot keep working in a long time. They need to take a rest and restore energy, aims to maintain working efficiency. However, the birth of automation means that there are the machines which can work for a long time, no rest in duration, as well as, it can boost efficiency, faster than human in more than 1 times. In long term, labour is varble. When machine can replace human, company will no longer to hire people. The global employment prospects will be worse.

Some people may argue that automation causes higher cost, such as operation cost and maintenance cost. However, the decision making of company is based on profit. The revenue that automation brings to the company higher than the cost it brings. The profit will be happened. The company will keep adopt it. Moreover, when the company wants to lower the cost, firing employee and no longer to hire workers are the best way to reduce the cost. Therefore, people may face unemployment. The global employment prospects will be undermined.

To conclude, automation can boost efficiency and profit. It may cause that the global employment prospects in long run will be undermined.

Revised:
Nowadays, automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. Some people think that this technological shift enhance global employment prospects, while others argue that it may undermine global employment prospects in long run.   Automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long run because the rising  productivity from automation will  replace routine labour and encourage firms to cut labour costs to raise profits.  
  
     By greatly rising  productivity, automation often replaces routine jobs and reduces demand for labour. In the past, the employees cannot  work for long periods. They need  breaks to recover and  maintain productivity. However, the birth of automation means that  machines  can work continuously without rest, as well as, they can be far faster and more efficient than humans. In the long term, demand for labour falls. When machines can replace humans, companies may  no longer hire as many workers. As a result, unemployment rises and global employment prospects worsen. 
  
    Some people may argue that automation causes higher costs, such as operation cost and maintenance cost. However, the decision making of companies is based on profit. The revenue that automation brings to the company is higher than the cost it brings. Then, the profit happens. The company will keep  adopt it. Moreover, when the company wants to lower the cost, firing employees and no longer to hire workers are the best way to reduce the cost. Therefore, people may face unemployment. Global employment prospects will be undermined. 
  
To conclude, automation can boost efficiency and profit. It undermines global employment prospects in the long run.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-22T09:37:00.812Z

**You:** Please help me to check my grammar

*Time:* 2025-11-22T09:43:33.998Z

**Assistant:** Great — I can help. First, a few quick questions so we set clear learning targets for this revision session.

1) What do you most want to improve right now? (Choose any: grammar/mechanics, clarity of ideas, thesis strength, paragraph structure/coherence, argument/evidence, style/word choice.)

2) Do you want to focus only on sentence-level grammar, or also on making your thesis and one paragraph clearer and stronger? (I recommend doing grammar plus either the thesis or one paragraph — that fits our three-step process.)

Once you confirm your targets I’ll:
- Give a short diagnostic using a simple rubric (Thesis & Argument, Organization, Evidence & Development, Language Use).
- Ask you to pick which diagnosed issues to focus on.
- Then we’ll start Step 1 (thesis revision).

Below is a quick diagnostic of your current draft to help you decide.

Brief diagnostic (strengths and areas to improve)
- Strengths
  - Clear overall position: you state that automation may undermine global employment prospects.
  - Logical structure: intro, body paragraphs, conclusion are present.
  - Relevant reasons are started (productivity/efficiency; company profit decisions).

- Areas to improve (by rubric)
  - Thesis & Argument: Thesis exists but is weak and wordy (redundant hedging: “In my view, I think”), and it doesn’t preview the main reasons clearly. Make it more direct and include the main points you’ll discuss.
  - Organization: Paragraph order is OK, but transitions and topic sentences are weak. Each paragraph should open with a clear topic sentence that connects directly to the thesis.
  - Evidence & Development: Claims are general and repetitive; add specific examples, data, or clearer explanations of how automation leads to unemployment. Avoid repeating the same idea in different words.
  - Language Use: Many sentence-level problems: subject–verb agreement, articles (a/the), plural/singular forms, prepositions, word choice, awkward phrasing, punctuation, and some unclear sentences. These make the argument harder to follow.

Examples of frequent grammar problems in your draft (quick fixes you can try)
- Redundant hedging: “In my view, I think it may undermine…” → remove redundancy (choose one).
- Articles and countable nouns: “the employee cannot keep working in a long time” → “employees cannot work for long periods” or “an employee cannot work for long periods.”
- Verb form and agreement: “automation… enhance global employment prospects” → “automation enhances…”
- Word choice / spelling: “labour is varble” → likely “labour is variable” or “demand for labour varies.”
- Awkward phrasing: “it can boost efficiency, faster than human in more than 1 times” → simplify: “it can be far faster and more efficient than human workers.”
- Verb patterns: “The company will keep adopt it” → “The company will continue to adopt it” or “The company will continue adopting it.”
- Articles and infinitives: “no longer to hire people” → “no longer hire people”
- Word order/clarity: “The profit will be happened” → “This will increase profits.”

Next step
Please tell me:
- Which target(s) do you want to focus on from the list above? (e.g., grammar only; grammar + strengthen thesis; grammar + revise paragraph 1)
- Which body paragraph would you like us to work on in Steps 2 and 3? (I suggest the first body paragraph about productivity/efficiency.)

After you confirm, we’ll start Step 1: I’ll ask you to share your current thesis (I see one in your draft) and then I’ll give targeted feedback so you can try rewriting it. Would you like to begin with grammar + thesis, and work on paragraph 1?

*Time:* 2025-11-22T09:44:00.175Z

**You:** Ok

*Time:* 2025-11-22T09:50:21.465Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. Before we begin, please confirm one quick decision so I follow your priorities:

- Do you want to focus on: grammar/mechanics + strengthening the thesis, and then revise Body Paragraph 1 (the productivity/efficiency paragraph)? (This is the option I recommended.)

If yes, we’ll start Step 1. If you want a different combination, tell me now.

Step 1 — Thesis statement
I see this thesis in your draft: “In my view, I think it may undermine global employment prospects in long run. The reasons are as follows:”

Quick feedback on that thesis
- Strengths: Your position is clear — you argue automation will harm employment in the long run.
- What to improve:
  - Remove redundant hedging: “In my view, I think” is repetitive. Choose one.
  - Be more direct and confident: use firm language (e.g., “will” or “is likely to”).
  - Preview the main reasons: state the two main points you plan to develop (e.g., machines replace routine jobs; firms cut labour to reduce costs and increase profit).
  - Fix small grammar: “in long run” → “in the long run.”

Try this short frame to rewrite your thesis (fill the blanks):
- “Automation will [main verb: reduce/undermine/likely reduce] global employment prospects in the long run because it [reason 1—e.g., increases productivity and replaces routine labour] and [reason 2—e.g., encourages firms to cut labour costs to raise profits].”

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using that frame? Type your revised thesis and I’ll give focused feedback and then we’ll confirm it before moving to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T09:50:38.258Z

**You:** Automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long run because it increases productivity and replaces routine labour and encourages firms to cut labour costs to raise profits.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T09:55:14.816Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a good start. I’ll take grammar + thesis + Body Paragraph 1, as we discussed. We’ll finish Step 1 (thesis) now, then move to Step 2 (topic sentence) when you’re ready.

Feedback on your revised thesis
Your sentence is clear and direct — good job removing the hedging. A few ways to strengthen it further:
- Make the two reasons parallel and clearly separated (right now they run together with two “and”s).
- Keep consistent spelling (you earlier used “labour” — stick with British “labour” or US “labor”).
- Tighten wording so it previews the paragraph claims more smoothly.

Your draft:
Automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long run because it increases productivity and replaces routine labour and encourages firms to cut labour costs to raise profits.

Hints to revise (try one of these moves)
- Use parallel structure: “because it [does A] and [does B].”
- Be concise: remove repeated words.
- Keep it natural: split long lists with a comma or “by” + gerund phrase.

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using those tips? Try one short sentence that:
- States your position confidently,
- Names the two reasons in parallel form,
- Uses “labour” (if you prefer British spelling).

If you’d like a quick model to compare after you try it, I can show one — but first, would you like to try revising it yourself? 

Once you’re happy with the thesis, we’ll move to Step 2. I plan to work on Body Paragraph 1 (the productivity/efficiency paragraph). Its current topic sentence is:
“To start with, automation can enhance productivity and efficiency.”

Quick feedback on that topic sentence
- It states a true point, but it doesn’t connect explicitly to your thesis claim that automation undermines employment.
- Make the connection clear: show how increased productivity leads to job loss (replace humans, reduce hiring) and preview the paragraph’s development.

Try revising the topic sentence now so it links to the thesis. For example, aim for something like:
- “By greatly increasing productivity, automation often replaces routine jobs and reduces demand for labour.”
(That’s only an example — please try drafting your own first.)

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now, or would you prefer I show a model thesis and model topic sentence to compare?

*Time:* 2025-11-22T09:55:37.478Z

**You:** Let me rewrite the thesis now

*Time:* 2025-11-22T10:12:50.029Z

**Assistant:** Great — paste your revised thesis when you’re ready.

Quick checklist to use before you send it:
- Directly answers the question (agree/disagree).
- Uses confident language (avoid “I think,” “may,” unless you mean likelihood).
- Previews the two main reasons you will develop.
- Is one clear sentence (keep it concise).

Once you paste it, I’ll give brief, focused feedback and suggest one small revision if needed. Then we’ll confirm it and move to Step 2 (the topic sentence for Paragraph 1). Would you like me to check grammar too, or just focus on clarity and strength?

*Time:* 2025-11-22T10:12:58.093Z

**You:** Nowadays, automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. Some people think that this technological shift enhance global employment prospects, while others argue that it may undermine global employment prospects in long run. In my view,  Automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long run because the increasing productivity will  replace routine labour and encourages firms to cut labour costs to raise profits. The reasons are as follows:

*Time:* 2025-11-22T10:16:21.026Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for that draft. I’ll proceed with the agreed targets: grammar/mechanics + strengthening the thesis, then revising Body Paragraph 1. Ready to start Step 1.

Quick, focused feedback on your current thesis:
- Strength: Your position is clear — you say automation will harm employment in the long run.
- Things to fix now:
  - Remove hedging/redundancy: delete “In my view,” (the thesis should state your view directly).
  - Fix capitalization: don’t capitalize “Automation” after a comma.
  - Make the two reasons parallel and fix verb agreement: "will replace… and encourages" should be parallel (both verbs should match).
  - Tighten wording and clarify cause: say something like “rising productivity from automation will replace routine labour and encourage firms to cut labour costs” rather than “the increasing productivity will replace routine labour and encourages firms…”
  - Remove “The reasons are as follows:” — that’s unnecessary in an essay thesis.

Use this short frame to rewrite (fill the blanks):
- Automation will [main verb: reduce/undermine/likely reduce] global employment prospects in the long run because [reason 1] and [reason 2].

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using those tips? Paste your new version and I’ll give quick, focused feedback (including one grammar tweak) before we move to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T10:16:38.254Z

**You:** Nowadays, automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. Some people think that this technological shift enhance global employment prospects, while others argue that it may undermine global employment prospects in long run.   Automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long run because the rising  productivity from automation will  replace routine labour and encourage firms to cut labour costs to raise profits.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T10:21:01.920Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — you’ve already moved in the right direction by removing hedging and stating a clear position. Before we continue, I’ll confirm our targets:

- Focus: grammar/mechanics + strengthening the thesis, then revise Body Paragraph 1 (productivity/efficiency paragraph). Correct?

If that’s correct, we’ll finish Step 1 now.

Focused feedback on your current thesis
Your sentence:  
"Automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long run because the rising productivity from automation will replace routine labour and encourage firms to cut labour costs to raise profits."

What’s good
- Clear position (you disagree).
- You’ve attempted to preview two reasons.

Small, specific problems to fix now
1. Repetition: “automation” appears twice — try to avoid repeating the same noun.
2. Wordiness / clarity: “the rising productivity from automation” is clunky. Use a tighter phrase like “higher productivity” or “productivity gains.”
3. Parallelism: the two reasons should be in the same grammatical form. Right now you have “will replace … and encourage …” — that can work, but tidy the phrasing so it flows.
4. Conciseness: shorten where possible and keep it to one clear sentence.
5. “in the long run” is correct — good job fixing that earlier.

Quick revision frame (use this to rewrite your thesis)
- Automation will [strong verb: undermine/reduce] global employment prospects in the long run by [reason A — short gerund/noun phrase] and [reason B — short gerund/noun phrase].

Two concise reason-phrases you can choose from or adapt
- replacing routine jobs through higher productivity
- prompting firms to cut labour to reduce costs and increase profits

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using that frame and one or two of those reason-phrases? Paste your revised single-sentence thesis and I’ll give one focused suggestion (grammar/style) and then we’ll confirm it before moving to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T10:21:25.906Z

**You:** No. Let’s move to Step 2

*Time:* 2025-11-22T10:22:33.900Z

**Assistant:** Okay — moving to Step 2.

Quick check before we begin: are you happy to keep this thesis as our working thesis?
"Automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long run because the rising productivity from automation will replace routine labour and encourage firms to cut labour costs to raise profits."
If yes, we’ll proceed. If you want one last small tweak, tell me now.

Now, Paragraph choice: I’ll work on Body Paragraph 1 (the productivity/efficiency paragraph), as planned.

Current topic sentence:
"To start with, automation can enhance productivity and efficiency."

Feedback in one sentence:
This topic sentence states a fact but doesn’t make the link to your thesis clear — it should say how higher productivity leads to job loss or reduced demand for labour.

Try revising the topic sentence now. Use this short frame to guide you:
"By [verb+ing / causing X], automation [effect on jobs / labour demand]."

Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence now? Paste your version and I’ll give focused feedback and one suggestion before we move to Step 3.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T10:22:46.597Z

**You:** Step 3 please

*Time:* 2025-11-22T10:24:20.275Z

**Assistant:** Great — ready for Step 3. Quick check before we dive in:

1) Is this the working thesis you want to keep?
Automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long run because the rising productivity from automation will replace routine labour and encourage firms to cut labour costs to raise profits.
Yes / No — if No, tell me one small change you want.

2) Do you have a revised topic sentence for Paragraph 1? If so, paste it now. If not, please write one using this short frame (fill the blanks):
By [verb+ing or causing X], automation [effect on jobs / labour demand].
(Example frame only — please type your own sentence.)

I won’t move on until you confirm both. Once you paste the topic sentence (or confirm the thesis/topic), we’ll do Step 3: revise the rest of the paragraph. Below are focused, short prompts and guidance you can use to revise; try one or two edits and paste the paragraph back so I can check.

Guided, sentence-level checklist for revising Paragraph 1
- Purpose / unity
  - Make sure every supporting sentence clearly explains HOW higher productivity leads to fewer jobs (e.g., machines replace routine tasks; firms need fewer workers).
  - Remove repetition — don’t restate the same idea in different words without adding new explanation or an example.

- Order / coherence
  - Start with the topic sentence (the explicit link to the thesis).
  - Follow with explanation of the mechanism (how automation replaces routine labour).
  - Add a short concrete example or a brief hypothetical (e.g., factory robots, self-checkouts).
  - End with a linking sentence that ties the paragraph back to the thesis (e.g., “As a result, demand for routine labour falls…”).

- Specific grammar/mechanics to fix (apply to sentences in your paragraph)
  - “the employee” → “employees” or “an employee” depending on meaning.
  - “cannot keep working in a long time” → change to a concise phrase: “cannot work for long periods.”
  - “no rest in duration” → “without rest” or “continuously.”
  - “faster than human in more than 1 times” → “far faster than humans” or “several times faster than human workers.”
  - “labour is varble” → “demand for labour varies” or “labour demand decreases.”
  - “company will no longer to hire people” → “companies will no longer hire people” or “companies will stop hiring.”
  - “The profit will be happened” → “This increases profits” or “This leads to higher profits.”
  - Use articles: “a machine,” “the company,” and correct verb forms: “automation enhances,” “companies adopt.”

- Content-development prompts (use these to expand sentences)
  - Explain mechanism: exactly which tasks get automated? (routine/manual/data-entry)
  - Short example: name one sector (manufacturing, retail) and the automated technology (robots, self-checkouts).
  - Consequence: explain hiring decisions — why would a company stop replacing workers after attrition or by not hiring?

Now, would you like to:
A) Try revising 1–2 sentences yourself and paste them here for feedback? (Recommended), or
B) Ask me to point-by-point correct specific sentences from your paragraph? (If you paste the paragraph, I’ll mark what to change but I won’t fully rewrite it for you.)

Which do you prefer? If you choose A, please paste your revised topic sentence and one supporting sentence you want checked. If B, paste the full paragraph and I’ll annotate line-by-line with short edits and suggestions.

**You:** Yes. Just keep it.  By greatly increasing productivity, automation often replaces routine jobs and reduces demand for labour

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming. I’ll keep your working thesis as is and I’ve replaced the old topic sentence with the version you want to keep. Nice clear, focused topic sentence — it links well to your thesis.

Here is the full essay with that single topic-sentence change included (I’ve left the rest of the paragraph as in your draft so you can revise those supporting sentences next):

---
Nowadays, automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. Some people think that this technological shift enhance global employment prospects, while others argue that it may undermine global employment prospects in long run. In my view, I think it may undermine global employment prospects in long run. The reasons are as follows:

By greatly increasing productivity, automation often replaces routine jobs and reduces demand for labour. In the past, the employee cannot keep working in a long time. They need to take a rest and restore energy, aims to maintain working efficiency. However, the birth of automation means that there are the machines which can work for a long time, no rest in duration, as well as, it can boost efficiency, faster than human in more than 1 times. In long term, labour is varble. When machine can replace human, company will no longer to hire people. The global employment prospects will be worse.

Some people may argue that automation causes higher cost, such as operation cost and maintenance cost. However, the decision making of company is based on profit. The revenue that automation brings to the company higher than the cost it brings. The profit will be happened. The company will keep adopt it. Moreover, when the company wants to lower the cost, firing employee and no longer to hire workers are the best way to reduce the cost. Therefore, people may face unemployment. The global employment prospects will be undermined.

To conclude, automation can boost efficiency and profit. It may cause that the global employment prospects in long run will be undermined.

Step 3 — Guided help to revise the rest of Paragraph 1
Nice work giving a clear topic sentence. Now let’s make the supporting sentences clear, grammatical, and tightly connected to that topic. I’ll give short, specific suggestions for parts of each sentence so you can edit them yourself (you try the rewrite — I’ll check it).

1) Sentence after topic sentence
- Original: “In the past, the employee cannot keep working in a long time.”
- Suggestion: change “the employee” → “employees”; “cannot keep working in a long time” → “cannot work for long periods.”
- Prompt for your rewrite: Try one sentence like: [employees + cannot work for long periods + brief reason]. Would you like to try rewriting it now?

2) Next sentence
- Original: “They need to take a rest and restore energy, aims to maintain working efficiency.”
- Problems to fix: subject clarity, verb forms, and phrase “aims to maintain working efficiency.”
- Quick fixes: replace “restore energy” with “restore their energy” or “recover”; use a clearer clause: “to maintain productivity.”
- Prompt: Try rewriting this as one clear clause that explains WHY humans need breaks (e.g., “so they can recover and maintain productivity”).

3) Explanation of machines
- Original: “However, the birth of automation means that there are the machines which can work for a long time, no rest in duration, as well as, it can boost efficiency, faster than human in more than 1 times.”
- Key fixes: simplify; use “machines can work continuously without rest”; “they can be far faster and more efficient than humans” (don’t use “more than 1 times”).
- Prompt: Try one or two shorter sentences: one stating machines work continuously, one stating they are faster/more efficient (include a short example if you want — e.g., “factory robots” or “self-checkout”).

4) Consequence sentence
- Original: “In long term, labour is varble. When machine can replace human, company will no longer to hire people. The global employment prospects will be worse.”
- Fixes:
  - “In the long term,” not “In long term.”
  - “labour is varble” — probably “demand for labour falls” or “demand for labour decreases.”
  - “When machine can replace human” → “When machines can replace humans,”
  - “company will no longer to hire people” → “companies may stop hiring” or “companies may no longer hire as many workers.”
  - Connect the consequence directly to the thesis: “As a result, unemployment rises and global employment prospects worsen.”
- Prompt: Try combining two of these ideas into one clear concluding sentence for the paragraph.

Quick checklist while you edit (apply to each sentence)
- Use plural nouns where general: employees, machines, companies.
- Use simple, correct verb forms: can work, are faster, may stop hiring.
- Use articles correctly: a machine, the company, the long run.
- Keep sentences short and specific; add one very short example if possible.

Would you like to:
A) Try revising one or two sentences now (paste them here), and I’ll give brief feedback? (Recommended)
B) Ask me to show one model revision of the whole paragraph so you can compare? (I can, but I’ll keep it short — only if you want.)

Which do you prefer? If A, paste the sentence(s) you rewrite and I’ll give a quick, encouraging check.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T10:28:42.874Z

**You:** B

*Time:* 2025-11-22T10:40:19.157Z

**Assistant:** Nice — you chose B, so here’s a short model revision of the whole first body paragraph plus the full essay with that paragraph replaced. I only revised Paragraph 1 (topic sentence + supporting sentences) as we agreed; I left the thesis and the rest of the essay in their current working form.

Quick note on what I changed in Paragraph 1
- Made the link to the thesis explicit (how productivity → job loss).
- Fixed grammar (plural nouns, verb forms, articles).
- Clarified the mechanism (machines work continuously, faster; firms need fewer workers).
- Added a brief concrete example and a clear concluding sentence that ties back to the thesis.

Nowadays, automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. Some people think that this technological shift enhance global employment prospects, while others argue that it may undermine global employment prospects in long run. In my view, I think it may undermine global employment prospects in long run. The reasons are as follows:

By greatly increasing productivity, automation often replaces routine jobs and reduces demand for labour. Employees cannot work continuously; they need breaks to recover and maintain productivity, which limits how much output human labour can provide. Machines, however, can operate continuously and perform repetitive tasks far faster and more reliably than humans—for example, factory robots can assemble parts around the clock and self‑service checkouts can process transactions without rest. Because machines can handle the same tasks at lower long‑term cost, firms have less need to hire or replace workers, so demand for routine labour falls and unemployment can rise.

Some people may argue that automation causes higher cost, such as operation cost and maintenance cost. However, the decision making of company is based on profit. The revenue that automation brings to the company higher than the cost it brings. The profit will be happened. The company will keep adopt it. Moreover, when the company wants to lower the cost, firing employee and no longer to hire workers are the best way to reduce the cost. Therefore, people may face unemployment. The global employment prospects will be undermined.

To conclude, automation can boost efficiency and profit. It may cause that the global employment prospects in long run will be undermined.

Would you like to:
- Try editing Paragraph 2 next (I can guide you line-by-line), or
- Work on tightening the thesis one last time (small tweak I suggested earlier), or
- Focus on sentence-level grammar across the whole essay?

If you want, paste one or two sentences from Paragraph 2 and I’ll give short, targeted hints (not full rewrites) so you can practice editing.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T10:40:47.006Z

**You:** To start with, by greatly rising  productivity, automation often replaces routine jobs and reduces demand for labour. In the past, the employees cannot  work for long periods. They need to take a rest and restore their energy, aims to maintain productivity. However, the birth of automation means that  machines  can work continuously without rest, as well as, they can be far faster and more efficient than humans. In the long term, demand for labour falls. When machines can replace humans, companies may  no longer hire as many workers. As a result, unemployment rises and global employment prospects worsen.

**Assistant:** Nice work — this version is much clearer and shows you used the suggestions (good job fixing several weak phrases). I’ll give a few short, focused comments, then show a clean, corrected paragraph and the full essay with that paragraph replaced.

Quick praise
- You tightened many sentences and made the logic clearer.
- You added a clear consequence sentence — that helps unity.

Short, specific suggestions (so you can refine further)
- Remove “To start with, by…” — pick either “To start with,” or the “By …” clause. Using both is redundant.
- Use present simple for general claims: “Employees cannot work for long periods” (not “cannot work for long periods” mixed with past forms).
- Combine short related ideas into single, clear sentences (you already started doing this).
- Keep punctuation and conjunctions simple: “they need breaks to recover and maintain productivity” (not “restore their energy, aims to…”).
- Minor word choice: “rising productivity” → “increasing productivity” or “productivity gains” reads better.

Would you like to try another small revision now? If you prefer, I made a corrected version below — read it, compare with yours, and tell me which parts you want to keep or change.

Here is a clean, corrected version of your Paragraph 1 (I kept your idea and structure, only fixed grammar and clarity):

By greatly increasing productivity, automation often replaces routine jobs and reduces demand for labour. Employees cannot work for long periods; they need breaks to recover and maintain productivity. Machines, however, can operate continuously and perform repetitive tasks far faster and more reliably than humans. For example, factory robots can assemble parts around the clock, and self‑service checkouts can process transactions without rest. Because machines can handle the same tasks at lower long‑term cost, companies have less need to hire or replace workers. As a result, unemployment rises and global employment prospects worsen.

And here is your full essay with that paragraph replaced (I did not change other paragraphs beyond this scope):

Next options — what would you like to do now?
- I can help edit Paragraph 2 line-by-line (you paste it and I’ll give brief corrections), or
- We can tighten the thesis into one concise sentence, or
- I can run a focused sentence-level grammar pass across the whole essay.

Which would you prefer?
