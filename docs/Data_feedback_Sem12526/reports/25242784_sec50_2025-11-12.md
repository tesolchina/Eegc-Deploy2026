            ## Contribution Analysis

            Your current topic sentence is a good starting point, but polishing it will strengthen its impact and align it more closely with your thesis. Here is a suggested revision you might consider or adapt:

**Revised topic sentence:**

"Another important way individuals contribute to combating climate change is by adopting sustainable habits in their daily lives, which help foster environmentally responsible behaviors and encourage market demand for eco-friendly products."

---

**Why this works:**

- It avoids tentative phrases like *“can also make small changes”*, giving a confident and direct statement.
- It frames personal actions as part of a broader influence, not just isolated “small changes.”
- It uses more academic vocabulary: “adopting sustainable habits,” “environmentally responsible behaviors,” “market demand.”
- It sets up your following examples about recycling, water use, walking, and consumer choices.

---

Would you like to try a similar revision yourself now, or shall I help you refine this version? Once the topic sentence is settled, we can move on to revising the supporting sentences in this paragraph for vocabulary, coherence, and flow.

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 – The essay demonstrates reasonably clear ideas, recognizing the dual impact of individuals and governments on climate action. The viewpoint is moderately well-developed but could further nuance the “partly agree” position and provide deeper analysis.
- Organization: 19/25 – The essay maintains a clear structure (introduction, two body paragraphs, conclusion), with logical flow. However, some transitions and paragraph unity need strengthening.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 – Adequate everyday vocabulary with occasional topic-specific terms (“carbon emissions,” “green lifestyle”). There are missed opportunities for more precise academic language.
- Grammar: 17/25 – Generally understandable, with noticeable errors in tense/agreement (“so is not always working well,” “so nothing happen”) and word choice.
- **Original Essay Total: 74/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 22/25 – The revised draft offers a clearer thesis and better developed argument in the first body paragraph. Examples now show collective action and mention systemic change, though the second body paragraph remains unchanged and could be more sophisticated.
- Organization: 21/25 – Improved topic sentences and internal logic in paragraph one. Some transitions still lacking, and paragraph two was not revised.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 – The first body paragraph now utilizes more academic vocabulary (“ecological sustainability,” “public advocacy,” “environmental policy”). The second paragraph remains fairly basic.
- Grammar: 19/25 – Noticeable improvement in sentence structure and accuracy in the revised body paragraph. Some grammar issues persist in the second paragraph (not fully revised).
- **Revised Essay Total: 82/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +8 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis statement revised for clarity and academic tone.
  - First body paragraph’s topic sentence strengthened; supporting details refined for unity and coherence.
  - Enhanced academic vocabulary and sentence structure in one body paragraph.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - No significant revision of the second body paragraph (“individuals...make small changes”); topic sentence remained weak and lacks academic rigor.
  - Limited attention to transitions and overall paragraph unity throughout the essay.
  - Some grammar and vocabulary errors remain, especially in the untouched section.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges:** 16
- **Conversation Quality:** The chat history reflects step-by-step scaffolding by the AI assistant, deep, task-focused questions, and consistent student engagement. The student revised the thesis and engaged with feedback. The topic sentence and one body paragraph for the first main point were revised through a clear collaborative process. The second body paragraph revision was started, but not completed.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation:** 4/5 – The student engaged in robust exchanges, with evidence of thoughtful revision and clarification. Exchanges covered multiple writing elements (thesis, topic sentences, supporting details). The discussion began on a second body paragraph before pausing.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions:** 4/5 – The student responded to feedback, articulated their choices, and made reasoned revisions, mostly accepting AI advice after discussion. The process would be strengthened by more back-and-forth or challenging of suggestions.
- **Refining Process:** 3/5 – Iterative revision was clear and effective for the thesis and one body paragraph, but the student did not complete revision for the second body paragraph. More cycles and complete revision would be needed for full credit.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total:** 11/15

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Willingness to take feedback: The student responded to targeted advice on thesis and paragraph focus, showing openness to revision.

- Basic understanding of revision strategy: The stepwise process for thesis/paragraph revision was followed closely for the first half of the essay.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Consistency in revision: The second body paragraph’s revision was started but left incomplete. Aim for equal attention to all essay sections.
- Depth of critical engagement: Consider discussing or challenging AI advice further to demonstrate sophisticated collaboration and editorial independence.
- Integration of transitions and paragraph unity: Strengthen flow and coherence, especially in sections that remain unchanged.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision:** Good – The student provided context (thesis/topic sentence) efficiently in response to AI cues, though mostly at the assistant’s prompting.
- **Strategic Planning:** Good – Revision followed a logical order, but more independent planning would further improve this area.
- **Critical Evaluation:** Good – The student articulated choices and occasionally reflected on feedback, though further questioning would deepen skill demonstration.
- **Independent Editing:** Developing – The student relied on AI guidance for structure and word choice; more autonomous decision-making needed for full effectiveness.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise all essay sections for consistency, including topic sentences and supporting details for each paragraph.
2. Practice questioning and critically evaluating AI advice, including offering alternatives or requesting clarification.
3. Build paragraph unity and transitions independently, aiming for full essay coherence without relying solely on AI guidance.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
The student demonstrates promising revision skills and willingness to collaborate with AI, producing clear improvements in thesis and paragraph unity. However, the student needs to complete all assigned revision tasks, including the second body paragraph and fuller integration of feedback throughout the essay. Encourage the student to persist through all steps of the process and to push for deeper critical engagement in the AI-assisted writing module.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. While systemic change driven by governments and corporations is essential for addressing climate change, individual actions remain significant—both in influencing policy and in fostering sustainable habits that support broader environmental goals.


A significant way people support climate action is by uniting to promote governmental policies that emphasise ecological sustainability. When large numbers of citizens demand stronger environmental protections, governments are more likely to respond. For instance, public protests and voting for environmentally conscious leaders can pressure policymakers to ban harmful pollutants or invest in renewable energy. In several countries, grassroots movements have successfully pushed for legislation to reduce plastic waste or limit carbon emissions. These examples demonstrate that public advocacy and collective action by citizens can significantly influence environmental policy, even if individuals acting alone have limited power. However, government responses are not always sufficient—leaders may acknowledge public concerns without implementing meaningful reforms. Additionally, many people who care about climate issues may lack the knowledge or resources to effectively communicate their demands to decision-makers, which can hinder progress.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T04:39:32.808Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T04:50:13.580Z

**Assistant:** Great! Thanks for sharing your thesis statement:

**"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."**

Let’s work through Step 1: Revising the Thesis Statement.

### My Comments:
- **Clarity**: Your thesis is generally clear, but it’s a bit long and could be more direct.
- **Strength**: The phrases “I partly agree with this idea” and “I also think” weaken your argument. Confident, precise language is better for academic writing.
- **Focus**: You mention two main points: citizen influence on government, and the role of personal green choices. Good! However, your thesis should do even more to preview the structure of your essay and answer the question directly.
- **Avoid “I think”/“I believe”**: Try to state your view as fact, not opinion.

#### Tips for Revision:
- Clearly state your position and preview both reasons.
- Use academic language—avoid hedging phrases like “I believe.”
- Directly answer the essay question: “Do individual actions matter compared to governments and companies for climate change?”

**Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement now, based on these suggestions? I’m here to help if you want more guidance or an example!**

*Time:* 2025-11-12T04:50:18.828Z

**You:** While systemic change driven by governments and corporations is essential for addressing climate change, individual actions remain significant—both in influencing policy and in fostering sustainable habits that support broader environmental goals.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:03:17.054Z

**Assistant:** Excellent revision attempt—you’ve made the statement much more confident and focused! Let’s check your revised thesis:

*"While systemic change driven by governments and corporations is essential for addressing climate change, individual actions remain significant—both in influencing policy and in fostering sustainable habits that support broader environmental goals."*

**Strengths:**
- You removed “I think”/“I believe,” which makes your thesis sound more assertive and academic.
- The thesis previews the structure: you’ll discuss how individuals (1) influence policy, and (2) foster sustainable habits.
- Directly answers the essay question.

**Suggestions for small improvement:**
- To make it even clearer and more specific (in line with the rubric), consider highlighting that individual actions are less impactful alone but become important through influence and example.
- You may clarify what “support broader environmental goals” means (e.g., inspiring collective action or driving market changes).

**Guiding question:**  
Would you like to add a phrase to clearly show that, while individuals cannot solve climate change alone, their influence and habits are important in combination with systemic change?

**Let me know if you are satisfied with the thesis now, or if you want to try an even clearer and more specific version. When you’re happy with your thesis, we’ll choose a body paragraph to revise next!**

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:03:21.735Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:04:10.711Z

**Assistant:** Great choice! You’ve selected this topic sentence to work on:

**"The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians."**

Let’s review it based on your new thesis:

### Comments:
- **Connection to Thesis:** Good job mentioning “influencing the government,” which matches the first main point in your revised thesis.
- **Clarity and Focus:** The phrase “the most important way” is very strong. If your thesis says individual actions are “significant” but less powerful alone, you might want softer language. “Most important” could sound like you’re agreeing entirely with one side, rather than balancing both as your thesis does.
- **Academic Tone:** “Help fight climate change” could be more formal (“address climate change”). Also, mentioning “policy or law changes” could clarify the type of influence.

#### Guiding questions:
- Can you revise the topic sentence so it** directly connects to your thesis and shows this is one way individuals matter**?
- Could you specify that influencing government means individuals work together to push for policy change?

**Would you like to try revising this topic sentence now?**  
Remember, you want it to clearly show how individual actions connect to climate policy or collective influence, and match the balanced view in your thesis. Let me know your attempt!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:04:17.242Z

**You:** A significant way people support climate action is by uniting to promote governmental policies that emphasize ecological sustainability.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:06:20.444Z

**Assistant:** That’s a strong revision! Here’s some feedback:

**Strengths:**
- “A significant way people support climate action” is a good, academic phrase.
- “Uniting to promote governmental policies” specifies collective influence.
- “Emphasize ecological sustainability” matches the topic.

**Suggestions for tightening the connection and clarity:**
- The word “significant” fits your balanced thesis, so that’s great.
- You might mention “individuals” or “citizens” for clarity, since some readers could interpret “people” more generally.
- Consider a tiny tweak for flow: “A significant way individuals contribute to climate action is by uniting to encourage governments to adopt policies that prioritize environmental sustainability.”

**Questions to guide you:**
- Do you want to use “individuals,” “citizens,” or “people”?
- Would you prefer “encourage governments to adopt policies” or “promote governmental policies,” depending on what you want to emphasize—pressure on leaders, or support for certain laws?

**Would you like to make one more quick revision based on these suggestions, or are you satisfied with your current topic sentence? Just let me know, and when you’re ready, we’ll move on to improving the rest of this paragraph!**

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:06:25.178Z

**You:** When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:11:06.583Z

**Assistant:** Great job providing your revised topic sentence and the full paragraph! Let’s work step by step to refine this paragraph for **clarity, unity, and coherence**, making sure each supporting detail aligns with your improved topic sentence and thesis.

**Your latest topic sentence (for reference):**  
*A significant way individuals contribute to climate action is by uniting to encourage governments to adopt policies that prioritize environmental sustainability.*

---

### Step 3: Paragraph Revision

#### 1. **Check Unity and Focus**

- Do all sentences relate directly to how individuals collectively influence government policy for climate action?  
- Are there any sentences that drift from this focus, or could be made more specific?

#### 2. **Clarity and Expansion**

- Can you clarify what forms of citizen action work best?  
- When mentioning examples, can you be more precise with vocabulary (e.g., “advocacy,” “grassroots movements,” “environmental legislation”)?

#### 3. **Coherence and Flow**

- Do the sentences follow a logical sequence (e.g., why citizens act → how they act → impact → limitations)?
- Are there places you could use linking words for smoother transitions (such as “however,” “for instance,” “as a result”)?

---

#### Guiding Questions for Revision:

1. **Evidence and Explanation:**  
   - You mention “protest or vote”—could you add a brief explanation why these actions are effective?
   - The sentence “This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect…”—can you specify how public opinion leads to actual policy change?

2. **Limitations:**  
   - In your last two sentences, you discuss the limitations (“government maybe just listen a little,” “people want change but don’t know how”).  
   - Can you use clearer language to show exactly what challenges individuals face in influencing policy?

3. **Vocabulary Improvement:**  
   - Are there places you can use more academic or topic-specific terms (e.g., “lobby,” “policy reform,” “legislation,” “public advocacy”)?  
   - Can you replace phrases like “normal people” with “citizens” or “the general public”?

---

**Would you like to try revising a few sentences for clarity or adding any academic vocabulary now?**  
Focus especially on the sentences about:  
- How individuals unite and act
- The impact of those actions  
- The challenges they face

If you want, you could start by revising one sentence at a time, and I’ll give quick feedback on each!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:11:16.940Z

**You:** When large numbers of citizens demand stronger environmental protections, governments are more likely to respond. For instance, public protests and voting for environmentally conscious leaders can pressure policymakers to ban harmful pollutants or invest in renewable energy. In several countries, grassroots movements have successfully pushed for legislation to reduce plastic waste or limit carbon emissions. These examples demonstrate that public advocacy and collective action by citizens can significantly influence environmental policy, even if individuals acting alone have limited power.

Additionally, many people who care about climate issues may lack the knowledge or resources to effectively communicate their demands to decision-makers, which can hinder progress.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:21:17.845Z

**Assistant:** Excellent work on revising your paragraph to be much clearer and more focused on collective citizen influence! Let’s walk through a guided review and final polish, using the three-step revision process and keeping the rubric in mind.

---

### Paragraph Review: Supporting Sentences

#### 1. **Unity and Focus**
- **Strengths**: Nearly every sentence now relates to citizens uniting to encourage government action on climate change—well done! You give specific examples (protests, voting, grassroots movements) and discuss both effectiveness and challenges.
- **Check**: Double-check if any sentence still feels too general or off-topic. For example, “public protests and voting for environmentally conscious leaders can pressure policymakers…”—is this directly supporting how citizen unity influences policy? (It does—great!)

#### 2. **Academic Vocabulary Enhancement**
- You’ve improved topic-specific language (“environmental protections,” “policymakers,” “grassroots movements,” “legislation,” “public advocacy”).
- Still, you might further strengthen your vocabulary use. For example:
  - Instead of “ban harmful pollutants,” consider “enact regulations on harmful emissions.”
  - Instead of “limit carbon emissions,” maybe say “implement carbon-reduction policies.”
- Would you like to try upgrading any of these terms?

#### 3. **Logical Progression and Coherence**
- Your flow is clear—from citizens’ demands → specific actions → successful examples → explanation of why it works → limitations/challenges.
- For coherence, you can use linking phrases wherever transitions are abrupt. For example, before discussing limitations, “Nevertheless,” or “However,” signals the shift well.

#### 4. **Critical Analysis (Rubric)**
- You acknowledge both strengths and weaknesses of citizen influence, which is good for critical thinking and helps you reach a “Proficient” or “Excellent” rubric score.
- You mention “lack knowledge or resources”—can you clarify this with an example? E.g., “may lack knowledge of effective advocacy strategies or access to platforms for raising their concerns.”

---

### Guided Questions

Would you like to try any of the following improvements?
1. Upgrade specific vocabulary—pick one sentence and try making it more precise or academic.
2. Add mini-examples or clarify your explanation of limitations (choose one challenge and explain briefly).
3. Insert a linking word or phrase to make the transition between success and limitations smoother.

**Just choose one sentence to revise at a time if you want!**  
Share your attempt, and I’ll give focused feedback.  
When you’re happy with this paragraph, we can confirm this section is complete.

**You:** On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:25:30.800Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your paragraph! You have some excellent ideas about individual actions and their role in combating climate change. Let's guide you step by step, focusing only on this paragraph for now.

**Step 2: Revising the Topic Sentence for Your Chosen Paragraph**

Your current topic sentence is:
> On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.

### Comments:
- **Connection to Thesis:** It introduces the idea of individual lifestyle changes. However, it can be more directly linked to your thesis’s balanced view about why these “small changes” matter.
- **Clarity and Strength:** Phrases like "can also make small changes" sound tentative. A more academic and confident tone is better.
- **Focus:** Instead of listing examples in your topic sentence, aim to state the main idea first, then support it with examples in following sentences.

#### Guiding Questions:
- Can you revise this topic sentence to clearly connect individual lifestyle choices to their broader environmental impact or influence (as previewed in your thesis)?
- Could you use stronger, more precise academic vocabulary (e.g., "adopting sustainable habits," "engaging in environmentally responsible behaviors")?

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now?**  
Respond with your revised topic sentence, and I’ll give helpful feedback before we continue to revising the rest of the paragraph!
