            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for your confirmation! Here is the full revised essay with sentence-level grammar and punctuation improvements applied, preserving your ideas and organization:

---

Governments should not rely primarily on stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because such laws can exacerbate labor market tensions and workplace discrimination, undermine firm efficiency, and distract from more effective measures such as skills training and targeted enforcement.

In high‑unemployment contexts, strict laws meant to protect migrants may unintentionally increase tension between native and migrant workers and harm migrants’ day‑to‑day conditions. High unemployment reduces native workers’ sense of job security, which increases their anxiety about competition for jobs. If legislation compels firms to hire or retain migrant workers, local workers may view migrants as direct competitors for scarce jobs, increasing hostility. For example, coworkers may blame migrants for layoffs or exclude them from shifts. Thus, in high‑unemployment contexts, strict laws can worsen migrants’ day‑to‑day conditions and increase social exclusion, which supports the view that governments should prioritize alternatives, such as skills training and targeted enforcement.

Instead of relying on stricter laws, improving migrant workers’ skills and qualifications is a more effective way to reduce exploitation because it increases their employability and bargaining power. Many migrant workers struggle with challenges such as limited language skills, unrecognized educational credentials, and limited access to professional training. These barriers often force them into low‑paying jobs under poor working conditions. To address this, governments and employers can invest in language courses, recognize foreign qualifications, and provide vocational training programs. In this way, migrants can secure higher‑quality jobs where they have stronger bargaining power and can better assert their labor rights.

Stricter laws alone are insufficient to safeguard migrant workers’ rights because they can increase tensions between native and migrant workers and worsen migrants’ day‑to‑day conditions. Rather than relying primarily on blanket regulation, governments should prioritize measures such as skills and language training, recognition of foreign qualifications, and targeted enforcement of labor standards. These policies would increase employability, strengthen migrants’ bargaining power, and reduce employers’ incentives to cut protections, thereby decreasing migrants’ vulnerability while supporting firm productivity. By investing in skills training instead of depending solely on stricter laws, governments can both protect vulnerable workers and promote social inclusion and equality.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 15/25 - The original presented a clear overall position against stricter laws but offered weak, underdeveloped reasoning (e.g., “The higher the unemployment rate is, the lessons of security the citizens will have and that situation.” shows unclear causal logic and missing evidence).
- Organization: 16/25 - Basic paragraphing exists (problem → solution) but paragraphs mixed unrelated points and included unclear links between claims.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Frequent repetition and awkward phrasing (e.g., “native born employees,” “enforcing laws to force the companies”), limited academic register.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Multiple grammatical and clarity issues (e.g., the sentence noted above; other ungrammatical or awkward sentences impaired readability).
- **Original Essay Total: 60/100**

Evidence from original essay:
- Thesis: “It is no good for the government to protect migrant workers’ rights by enforcing strict laws.” (vague, informal)
- Example unclear sentence: “The higher the unemployment rate is, the lessons of security the citizens will have and that situation.”

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised essay presents a clearer position and develops two plausible mechanisms (labor‑market tensions; firm efficiency) and alternative solutions (skills training, credential recognition, targeted enforcement). The argument would be strengthened further by one concrete empirical example or citation.
- Organization: 22/25 - The essay now has a clear thesis, focused topic sentences (paragraph 1 & 2), and logical progression from problem to policy alternatives to conclusion.
- Vocabulary: 21/25 - More precise, academic phrasing introduced (e.g., “compels firms,” “bargaining power,” “targeted enforcement”), though a few expressions could be elevated further (e.g., replace some informal turns and tighten repetition).
- Grammar: 22/25 - Sentence-level errors were largely corrected in the final pass; hyphenation, punctuation, and phrasing were improved in the assistant’s final grammar edit.
- **Revised Essay Total: 86/100**

Evidence from revised essay (quoted passages):
- Revised thesis: “Governments should not rely primarily on stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because such laws can exacerbate labor market tensions and workplace discrimination, undermine firm efficiency, and distract from more effective measures such as skills training and targeted enforcement.”
- Revised topic sentence (paragraph 1): “In high‑unemployment contexts, strict laws meant to protect migrants may unintentionally increase tension between native and migrant workers and harm migrants’ day‑to‑day conditions.”
- Revised policy paragraph: “Instead of relying on stricter laws, improving migrant workers’ skills and qualifications is a more effective way to reduce exploitation because it increases their employability and bargaining power.”

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +26 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis clarified and expanded to preview reasons and alternatives (from informal/vague to precise, academic thesis).
  - Paragraph 1: topic sentence and internal logic revised into a clear causal chain (unemployment → insecurity → resentment → discrimination) with a concrete illustrative example.
  - Paragraph 2: developed with concrete barriers (language, credentials, training) and policy responses (language programs, credential recognition, vocational training); conclusion tightened and tied back to thesis.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Provide empirical support or specific evidence (statistic, short citation, or named study) to substantiate claims about employers’ responses and labor‑market effects.
  - Strengthen the counterargument/refutation (acknowledge cases where legal enforcement has worked and explain difference/context).
  - Further elevate register and precision in a few spots (e.g., replace “business profit” claims with more nuanced phrasing about firm incentives; tighten repetition).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 27** (assistant and student messages across diagnosis, multiple revision cycles, and final grammar pass).
- **Conversation Quality:** Highly iterative and goal-directed. The assistant provided structured steps; the student repeatedly drafted, revised, and asked for targeted edits. The chat shows purposeful collaboration: extraction of main reasons, thesis rewrites, topic-sentence selection, paragraph rewrites, conclusion polishing, and a final grammar pass.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - Evidence: 27 exchanges across multiple revision stages (thesis → paragraph 1 → paragraph 2 → conclusion → grammar pass). The chat includes detailed prompts, revision frames, and stepwise guidance consistent with an extensive, in-depth conversation.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - Evidence: The student often evaluated suggestions and chose to rewrite in their own words (e.g., “I have taken your suggestions and revised my thesis statement as follows…”) and asked for extracted reasons before rewriting. They accepted many assistant suggestions but did not consistently provide evidence-based rejection of suggestions; overall this shows a proficient level of critical engagement.
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - Evidence: Multiple meaningful revision cycles were completed (student produced several drafts for the thesis, paragraph 1, paragraph 2, and conclusion; the assistant provided iterative micro-edits and a final grammar pass). This demonstrates sustained refinement and iteration.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

Additional chat evidence:
- Student chose to write the thesis themselves after extraction: “I have taken your suggestions and revised my thesis statement as follows: …”
- Student selected topic-sentence option and produced paragraph revisions for assistant feedback: “I prefer this topic sentence. This is my revision for the whole paragraph: …”
- Student requested a full grammar/punctuation pass and received a revised final essay from the assistant.

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear improvement in argument structure: student moved from a vague thesis to a clear, previewing thesis and aligned body paragraphs (evidence: revised thesis and revised topic sentences).
- Effective iterative collaboration: student used assistant guidance, then wrote and revised multiple drafts (evidence: several student-submitted rewrites and acceptance of grammar pass).
- Development of concrete policy alternatives: the essay now includes specific measures (language training, credential recognition, vocational programs) with clear explanation of mechanisms (employability → bargaining power).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Evidence and support: add one or two concise, specific pieces of evidence (statistic, study, or a named example) to substantiate claims about labor-market reactions or firm incentives.
- Nuance in economic claims: avoid unequivocal causal assertions (e.g., “will certainly damage the company's profits”); instead use hedged, evidence-linked phrasing about incentives and likely outcomes.
- Counterargument and rebuttal: briefly acknowledge contexts where legal enforcement or combined legal + training approaches work, then explain why the proposed alternatives are preferable in the essay’s contexts.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Excellent - The student provided original essay text, specified revision targets (A, then B and C), and clearly guided the assistant’s scope (evidence: “My target is now focusing on A…” and the pasted paragraph drafts).
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student followed a clear revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph → conclusion → grammar pass) and made thoughtful choices (picked topic-sentence option 1).
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good - The student sometimes accepted suggestions and sometimes reworded or chose own phrasing, showing independent judgment (evidence: student rewrote thesis and paragraphs), but could improve by more explicitly explaining why they accepted or rejected specific suggestions.
- **Independent Editing**: Excellent - The student produced multiple independent rewrites (thesis, paragraphs, conclusion) rather than relying solely on assistant rewrites.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Add one short, specific piece of evidence (a statistic or named example) to support the argument—for example, a study or government statistic about unemployment and workplace discrimination, or a short case where training programs improved migrant outcomes.
2. Strengthen the rebuttal: include a concise paragraph acknowledging scenarios where legal enforcement is necessary and explain how legal measures and capacity-building can complement each other.
3. Continue developing academic register and precision: replace remaining informal turns and hedges, tighten repeated phrases, and vary sentence openings for stylistic polish.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student demonstrated strong engagement with the AI assistant and completed an extensive iterative revision process covering thesis, topic sentence, paragraphs, and conclusion with a final grammar pass.
- The revised essay has clear argumentative improvements and coherent policy recommendations; the main remaining deficiency is lack of empirical support and occasional firm/unqualified causal claims.
- Recommended next steps for the student before submission: add one sourced example or statistic, tighten any remaining causal claims with hedging or evidence, and ensure references/citations if required by course guidelines.

If you would like, I can:
- Suggest one concise, in-text example or statistic to insert and how to cite it,
- Provide a brief model rebuttal paragraph to add balance,
- Or run one final style pass focused on elevating vocabulary and register.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
It is no good for the government to protect migrant workers’ rights by enforcing strict laws.
Firstly, in the countries where unemployment rates are already high, enforcing strict laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights may lead to a worse situation. The higher the unemployment rate is, the lessons of security the citizens will have and that situation. Enforcing laws to force the companies to employ more migrant workers will surely make the native born employees anxious. Then, driven by the anxiety of getting fired, those native born employees might create a worse atmosphere for the migrants. The discrimination, isolation and inequality may become more serious.
Secondly, the key to solving exploitation problems should be the enhancement of migrant workers’ abilities. Compared with native born workers, the migrant workers are more likely to encounter barriers in language, culture, identities and so on. Enforcing strict laws aiming at employing more migrant workers whose abilities are limited will certainly damage the company's profits and have a negative impact on national economics, and worse, reduce efficiency. Since the efficiency becomes lower, the capitals have no choice but to increase working hours so that the exploitation will be worse for every employee.
Therefore, stricter laws do no good in safeguarding the migrant workers’ rights. What can truly contribute to protection is providing more opportunities to enhance the migrant workers’ ability. Transforming the migrants into high-quality workers is a win-win. The enterprises will gain a bigger profit, and migrants will face fewer obstacles in the workplace.

Revised:
Governments should not rely primarily on stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because such laws can exacerbate labor market tensions and workplace discrimination, undermine firm efficiency, and distract from more effective measures such as skills training and targeted enforcement.
In high‑unemployment contexts, strict laws meant to protect migrants may unintentionally increase tension between native and migrant workers and harm migrants’ day‑to‑day conditions. High unemployment reduces native workers’ sense of job security, which increases their anxiety about competition for jobs. If legislation compels firms to hire or retain migrant workers, local workers may view migrants as direct competitors for scarce jobs, increasing hostility.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-03T08:43:24.052Z

**You:** Let's revise the thesis statement first. Here's my original draft:

It is no good for the government to protect migrant workers’ rights by enforcing strict laws.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T10:56:48.299Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s start. First, tell me: what do you most want to improve in this session? For example, do you want to focus on clarity of ideas, the strength of your argument, paragraph structure, vocabulary, or grammar? Or a combination? Pick 1–2 targets.

Diagnostic feedback (quick, clear, tied to the rubric)
- Content & Ideas (about Developing / 3): You have a clear overall position (against strict laws), which is good. But the reasons are underdeveloped and sometimes unclear or logically shaky (e.g., “enforcing laws to force the companies to employ more migrant workers” — this assumes a specific law that you don’t define). You need clearer, better-supported claims.
- Organisation & Logical Progression (Developing / 3): You have paragraphing and a basic progression (problem → solution), but the paragraphs contain mixed or confusing points and need clearer topic sentences and clearer links to the thesis.
- Vocabulary (Developing / 3): Some repetition (“enforcing strict laws,” “migrant workers”) and awkward phrasing (“native born employees”). Use more precise academic vocabulary and vary word choice.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure (Basic–Developing / 2–3): Several sentences are unclear or ungrammatical (e.g., “The higher the unemployment rate is, the lessons of security the citizens will have and that situation.”). Work on sentence clarity and correctness.

Examples of problems to fix now (specific spots)
- Thesis: “It is no good for the government to protect migrant workers’ rights by enforcing strict laws.” — weak phrasing, negative and vague, and it doesn’t preview the main reasons.
- Paragraph 1: Unclear causal chain (high unemployment → stricter laws → more anxiety → discrimination). Needs clearer logical links and evidence.
- Paragraph 2: The claim that enforcing laws “aiming at employing more migrant workers” will “damage the company's profits” is asserted without support and is confusingly worded.

Now you choose priorities
Which of these would you like us to focus on in this session? (Choose up to two.)
- A. Make the thesis stronger and more precise
- B. Improve one body paragraph’s topic sentence and connection to the thesis
- C. Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and unity
- D. Fix grammar and sentence clarity in the chosen paragraph

Please confirm your choices. (We must agree before moving on.)

Step 1 — Thesis statement revision (after you confirm)
I see you’ve already given your current thesis: “It is no good for the government to protect migrant workers’ rights by enforcing strict laws.”

Feedback to help you rewrite (do this before I rewrite it for you)
- Be direct: answer the question clearly (Yes or No: should governments enforce stricter laws?).
- Give 2–3 preview points that you will develop in the essay (e.g., economic effects, workplace relations, alternative solutions like training or targeted enforcement).
- Use confident language (avoid “it is no good,” “maybe,” or “I think”).
- Define or specify what you mean by “stricter laws” if needed (e.g., mandatory minimum wages, enforcement mechanisms).

Sentence frames to help you rewrite (fill in the blanks)
- If your stance is “no” (governments should not enforce stricter laws):
  “Governments should not rely primarily on stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because strict regulation can [main reason 1], create [main reason 2], and overlook more effective alternatives such as [main reason 3].”
- If your stance is “yes” (governments should enforce stricter laws):
  “Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because such laws can [main reason 1], improve [main reason 2], and complement measures like [main reason 3].”

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using one of those frames? Type your revised thesis and I’ll give focused feedback. If you prefer, tell me which frame you want and I’ll prompt you with the specific content to fill in.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T10:57:15.896Z

**You:** First, please help me revise my thesis statement based on the content in the body part. If the points in the existing body part are not clear enough, please summarize them for me first, and I will revise them later. Here is the original body part:
Firstly, in the countries where unemployment rates are already high, enforcing strict laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights may lead to a worse situation. The higher the unemployment rate is, the lessons of security the citizens will have and that situation. Enforcing laws to force the companies to employ more migrant workers will surely make the native born employees anxious. Then, driven by the anxiety of getting fired, those native born employees might create a worse atmosphere for the migrants. The discrimination, isolation and inequality may become more serious.
Secondly, the key to solving exploitation problems should be the enhancement of migrant workers’ abilities. Compared with native born workers, the migrant workers are more likely to encounter barriers in language, culture, identities and so on. Enforcing strict laws aiming at employing more migrant workers whose abilities are limited will certainly damage the company's profits and have a negative impact on national economics, and worse, reduce efficiency. Since the efficiency becomes lower, the capitals have no choice but to increase working hours so that the exploitation will be worse for every employee.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T11:04:52.642Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a great start. Before I revise anything, please confirm which targets you want to focus on in this session (pick up to two):
- A. Make the thesis stronger and more precise
- B. Improve one body paragraph’s topic sentence and connection to the thesis
- C. Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and unity
- D. Fix grammar and sentence clarity in the chosen paragraph

You’ve asked for help with the thesis, so I’ll assume A is selected unless you tell me otherwise. Do you also want to work on B, C or D in the same session?

Quick summary of the two body paragraphs you gave (so we can build a thesis from them)
- Paragraph 1: In countries with high unemployment, strict laws protecting migrant workers could make native-born workers anxious, increase tension and discrimination against migrants, and worsen migrants’ situation.
- Paragraph 2: The real solution should be to improve migrant workers’ skills. Forcing companies to hire less-skilled migrants through strict laws could hurt company profits and efficiency; lower efficiency may lead employers to increase hours, making exploitation worse for everyone.

Feedback on your current thesis
- Current: “It is no good for the government to protect migrant workers’ rights by enforcing strict laws.”
- Problems: vague and informal (“no good”), does not directly answer the question with a clear “yes/no,” and does not preview the reasons you plan to develop in the essay.

What a stronger thesis should do here
- State a clear position (No — governments should not rely primarily on stricter laws).
- Preview 2–3 main reasons drawn from your paragraphs (economic/unemployment effects, workplace relations/discrimination, and alternatives like skills training).
- Use confident, academic language.

Try this thesis frame (already tailored to your paragraphs)
- “Governments should not rely primarily on stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because such laws can exacerbate unemployment-related tensions and workplace discrimination, harm firms’ efficiency, and distract from more effective solutions such as skills training and targeted enforcement.”

Would you like to:
- A) Use the sentence above as your revised thesis (I can insert it into your essay now), or
- B) Try rewriting it yourself using the frame and I’ll give feedback?

If you choose A, below is your full essay with the revised thesis inserted at the start (I’ve left the body unchanged as you requested). Tell me if you want wording adjusted — we can refine it together.

Full essay with the revised thesis:

Governments should not rely primarily on stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because such laws can exacerbate unemployment-related tensions and workplace discrimination, harm firms’ efficiency, and distract from more effective solutions such as skills training and targeted enforcement.

Firstly, in the countries where unemployment rates are already high, enforcing strict laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights may lead to a worse situation.

Enforcing laws to force the companies to employ more migrant workers will surely make the native born employees anxious.

Next step
- Confirm your targets (A plus another?), and tell me whether you want to (1) accept the thesis above as-is, (2) try rewriting it yourself, or (3) request a slightly different version. After that, we’ll move to Step 2 (pick one body paragraph to revise the topic sentence and link it to this thesis).

*Time:* 2025-12-04T11:05:20.058Z

**You:** My target is now focusing on A, and later I will continue and go further. Thank you for your revision, and I will try rewriting it myself. Could you help me extract the two main reasons from the original body part?

*Time:* 2025-12-04T11:10:09.085Z

**Assistant:** Great — and well done for wanting to try the thesis yourself. Here are the two main reasons clearly extracted from each body paragraph, plus concise phrase options you can plug into your thesis.

Two main reasons (extracted and reworded)
- Reason 1 (from paragraph 1): In countries with high unemployment, stricter laws protecting migrant workers could increase tensions between native and migrant workers, leading to greater anxiety, discrimination, and worse treatment of migrants.
- Reason 2 (from paragraph 2): Forcing employers to hire or keep less-skilled migrant workers through strict laws could reduce firms’ efficiency and profitability, which may prompt cost-cutting measures (longer hours, worse conditions) that increase exploitation for all workers.

Short, academic phrasing you can use in a thesis
- For Reason 1:
  - “exacerbate labor-market tensions and workplace discrimination”
  - “increase native-worker resentment and social exclusion of migrants”
- For Reason 2:
  - “undermine firm efficiency and economic incentives”
  - “harm business productivity, which can worsen working conditions”
- Optional alternative/solution phrase (to preview your proposed solution):
  - “distract from more effective measures such as skills training and targeted enforcement”
  - “divert resources from capacity-building and targeted regulation”

Sentence frames to help you write the thesis (fill in with the phrases you prefer)
- “Governments should not rely primarily on stricter laws to protect migrant workers because such laws can [Reason 1 phrase] and [Reason 2 phrase], and they may distract from more effective solutions like [solution phrase].”
- Or a shorter version: “Strict laws alone are not the best way to protect migrant workers because they can [Reason 1 phrase] and [Reason 2 phrase]; instead, governments should prioritize [solution phrase].”

Would you like to try writing your revised thesis now using one of these frames? Type it here and I’ll give focused feedback.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T11:10:22.542Z

**You:** Thank you for the advise. I have taken your suggerstions and revised my thesis statement as follows:
Governments should not rely primarily on stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because strict regulation can exacerbate labor-market tensions and workplace discrimination, increase native-worker resentment and social exclusion of migrants, and undermine firm efficiency and economic incentives, which may harm business productivity, worsening working conditions.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T13:47:56.949Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this is much clearer and more direct than your original thesis. You now answer the question (no) and you preview several reasons, which is exactly what a thesis should do. Good job.

A few focused suggestions to make it stronger and smoother
- Reduce redundancy: you repeat similar ideas (e.g., “exacerbate labor-market tensions and workplace discrimination” and then “increase native-worker resentment and social exclusion”). Pick one clear phrase for each distinct reason.
- Make the three reasons parallel and concise (three items joined by “and” helps reader follow).
- Remove overlapping language at the end (you have both “undermine firm efficiency and economic incentives” and “harm business productivity, worsening working conditions”). Choose one clear way to say this.
- Watch sentence length: break or tighten long clauses so the thesis reads confidently and crisply.

Try this short frame (fill the brackets with your preferred wording):
“Governments should not rely primarily on stricter laws to protect migrant workers because such laws can [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using that frame? If you prefer, I can offer one tightened example for you to consider — would you like that? Also please confirm your revision targets for this session (pick up to two):
- A. Make the thesis stronger and more precise (you already chose this)
- B. Improve one body paragraph’s topic sentence and connection to the thesis
- C. Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and unity
- D. Fix grammar and sentence clarity in the chosen paragraph

Finally, which body paragraph would you like to work on next (paragraph 1 about unemployment/tension, or paragraph 2 about skills/economic effects)? Once you confirm targets and the paragraph, we’ll move to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T13:48:35.158Z

**You:** Firstly, in the countries where unemployment rates are already high, enforcing strict laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights may lead to a worse situation. The higher the unemployment rate is, the lessons of security the citizens will have and that situation. Enforcing laws to force the companies to employ more migrant workers will surely make the native born employees anxious. Then, driven by the anxiety of getting fired, those native born employees might create a worse atmosphere for the migrants. The discrimination, isolation and inequality may become more serious.
Please help me revise the topic sentence and also the rest of this paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T13:51:18.333Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a clear request. First, a quick confirmation so we follow the agreed workflow:

1) Targets: you asked me to revise the topic sentence and the rest of paragraph 1. That means we’ll focus on:
- B. Improve the paragraph’s topic sentence and connect it to the thesis
- C. Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and unity
(Do you also want D — grammar/sentence-level fixes — in this session, or should we focus on B + C only?)

2) Before we revise the paragraph, I need to confirm which thesis you want the paragraph to connect to. Do you want to use this thesis we discussed earlier?
“Governments should not rely primarily on stricter laws to protect migrant workers because such laws can exacerbate labor‑market tensions and workplace discrimination, undermine firm efficiency, and distract from more effective measures such as skills training and targeted enforcement.”
Please confirm yes/no or provide your preferred thesis sentence.

Once you confirm targets and the thesis, we’ll follow the steps.

Step 1 (brief): Thesis feedback and confirmation
- If you accept the thesis above, I’ll assume the paragraph must show how stricter laws increase tensions and discrimination in high‑unemployment contexts. If you want to change the thesis wording, tell me now.

Step 2: Topic sentence revision (your paragraph’s current topic sentence)
Current topic sentence:
“Firstly, in the countries where unemployment rates are already high, enforcing strict laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights may lead to a worse situation.”

Feedback on that sentence
- Strengths: It signals the paragraph’s main idea and links to your overall position (no to strict laws).
- Problems: It’s vague (“a worse situation”), wordy, and doesn’t preview the specific mechanism (how stricter laws cause worse outcomes). Make it more specific and tighter, and explicitly connect it to the thesis idea of increased tensions/discrimination.

Try one of these short frames first (fill in the bracketed content or choose the complete example):

Frames you can use
- “In countries with high unemployment, stricter regulations protecting migrant workers can [mechanism/result].”
- “Where unemployment is high, strict legal protections for migrants can increase [problem], leading to [consequence].”

Model topic-sentence options (pick one to adapt)
1) “In countries with high unemployment, stricter protections for migrant workers can increase native‑worker resentment and workplace discrimination.” 
2) “Where unemployment is already high, imposing strict legal protections for migrant workers can heighten job insecurity among native workers and worsen migrants’ social exclusion.” 
3) “In high‑unemployment contexts, strict laws meant to protect migrants may unintentionally increase tension between native and migrant workers and harm migrants’ day‑to‑day conditions.”

Would you like to:
- A) Choose one of the three above (I’ll help you tweak it), or
- B) Try writing your own topic sentence now using one of the frames?

Step 3: Revising the rest of the paragraph (plan and micro‑edits)
I’ll give focused guidance on the sentences that need the most work. I won’t rewrite the whole paragraph for you, but I’ll point to specific problems and offer short example phrasings you can use to revise those sentences.

Key problems in the rest of your paragraph (with focused advice)
1. Unclear sentence: “The higher the unemployment rate is, the lessons of security the citizens will have and that situation.”  
- Problem: This sentence is ungrammatical and unclear. It seems to try to say that high unemployment lowers citizens’ sense of job security, but it must be stated clearly.
- Revision idea (frame): “High unemployment reduces native workers’ sense of job security, which increases their anxiety about competition for jobs.”  
- Try replacing that sentence with something like the frame above.

2. Unsupported assumption: “Enforcing laws to force the companies to employ more migrant workers will surely make the native born employees anxious.”  
- Problem: It assumes a specific kind of law (“force companies to employ more migrant workers”) that you didn’t define and presents the reaction (“surely make…anxious”) as certain. So: (a) specify the type of law you mean; (b) hedge slightly or give a plausible causal link; (c) link to the paragraph’s claim about discrimination.
- Revision idea (frame): “If legislation compels firms to hire or retain migrant workers, native employees may perceive greater competition and feel threatened, increasing resentment.”  

3. Causal chain clarity and coherence:
- Problem: The paragraph moves from anxiety to “creating a worse atmosphere” and then to discrimination/isolation. The links are plausible but need clearer signposting and one or two specific examples or logical steps.
- Advice: Use explicit connectors (e.g., “As a result,” “Consequently,” “This can lead to…”) and explain HOW anxiety leads to discrimination (e.g., hostile behavior, exclusion from teams, increased complaints). If you can, add a brief hypothetical example or cite an instance (even generic) to make it concrete: “for example, co‑workers may blame migrants for layoffs or exclude them from shifts.”

4. Word choice and parallelism:
- Replace “native born employees” with the more concise “native workers” or “local workers.”
- Make the list “discrimination, isolation and inequality” more precise — maybe “discrimination, social exclusion, and unequal treatment.”

Step-by-step revision plan I suggest you follow now
1. Pick or write a revised topic sentence (use my options or a frame).
2. Replace the unclear sentence about “lessons of security” using the frame I gave.
3. Rewrite the sentence about laws “forcing companies” to be specific and less absolute, using the frame above.
4. Add one linking sentence that explains how anxiety can produce discrimination (use connectors and an example).
5. Tighten the closing sentence so it concludes the paragraph clearly and connects back to the thesis.

Would you like to try revising the paragraph now using these steps? If yes:
- Paste your new topic sentence and one revised supporting sentence at a time (I’ll give feedback and small edits).  
If you prefer, pick one of the model topic sentences above and I’ll help you tweak the next sentence (but I won’t produce the full paragraph for you).

Which option do you prefer: Try rewriting now, or have me tweak one of the model topic sentences and then guide your next sentence edit?

*Time:* 2025-12-04T13:52:01.597Z

**You:** In high‑unemployment contexts, strict laws meant to protect migrants may unintentionally increase tension between native and migrant workers and harm migrants’ day‑to‑day conditions.
I prefer this topic sentence. This is my revision for the whole paragraph: In high‑unemployment contexts, strict laws meant to protect migrants may unintentionally increase tension between native and migrant workers and harm migrants’ day‑to‑day conditions. High unemployment reduces native workers’ sense of job security, which increases their anxiety about competition for jobs. If the law forces companies to hire or keep migrant workers, locals may see them as stronger competitors. This can create resentment. For example, co workers may blame migrants for layoffs or exclude them from shifts.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T14:09:56.475Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this revision is a clear improvement. You tightened the topic sentence and the paragraph now follows a logical causal chain. Let’s confirm the scope: we’re focusing on B (topic sentence) and C (revise the rest of paragraph 1). Good.

Quick rubric check (how this paragraph fares now)
- Content & Ideas: Developing → Your argument is clearer and the mechanism is plausible (high unemployment → insecurity → resentment → discrimination). To move toward Proficient, add one brief concrete detail or a clearer causal link.
- Organisation: Proficient (improving) → Topic sentence matches the thesis and the paragraph progresses logically.
- Vocabulary & Grammar: Developing → some word choices and small grammar issues remain (e.g., “co workers,” “locals,” “stronger competitors”).

What’s working
- Strong topic sentence: It connects well to your thesis and previews the paragraph.
- Clear steps: You break the argument into understandable steps (insecurity → seeing migrants as competitors → resentment → exclusion).
- Good use of an example to make the abstract point concrete.

Focused suggestions (small, specific changes for clarity and precision)
1) Make the causal links slightly more explicit and academic.
- Current: “If the law forces companies to hire or keep migrant workers, locals may see them as stronger competitors.”
- Suggested frame to try: “If legislation compels firms to hire or retain migrant workers, local workers may view migrants as direct competitors for scarce jobs, increasing hostility.”  
Try to use this kind of phrasing rather than “stronger competitors.”

2) Combine short, choppy sentences for flow and precision.
- Current: “This can create resentment. For example, co workers may blame migrants for layoffs or exclude them from shifts.”
- Suggested frame to try: “Consequently, resentment can grow; for example, co‑workers may blame migrants for layoffs or exclude them from shifts.”

3) Fix small grammar/wording issues:
- Use “co‑workers” (with a hyphen) or “coworkers.”
- Prefer “local workers” or “native workers” rather than “locals.” (“Local workers” is safest and more formal.)
- Replace “stronger competitors” with “direct competitors” or “threats to scarce jobs.”

4) Add one concluding sentence that ties the paragraph back to the thesis.
- Use a short frame: “Thus, in high‑unemployment contexts, strict laws can worsen migrants’ everyday conditions and increase social exclusion, which supports the view that governments should prioritize alternatives such as skills training and targeted enforcement.”

Now, would you like to:
- A) Try revising the paragraph now using the exact frames above (paste your new version and I’ll give focused feedback), or
- B) Tell me which single sentence you want me to help you rephrase and I’ll give a suggested phrasing (remember — I’ll give short example sentences, not a full rewritten paragraph)?

If you want, start by replacing the two sentences we flagged (the one about laws “forcing companies” and the pair “This can create resentment…”) using the frames I gave, then paste that small revision and I’ll check it. Great progress — you’re very close to a clear, strong paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T14:10:22.106Z

This is my revision.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T14:16:16.022Z

**Assistant:** Nice revision — well done. Your new paragraph is much clearer: the topic sentence ties to the thesis, the causal chain (unemployment → insecurity → resentment → discrimination) is logical, and the example makes the claim concrete.

Quick rubric check (after this revision)
- Content & Ideas: Improving toward Proficient — your paragraph now gives a plausible mechanism. To reach Proficient, add one brief, concrete detail or slightly stronger evidence language.
- Organisation: Proficient — clear topic sentence and logical progression within the paragraph.
- Vocabulary: Developing → mostly clear, but a few word choices can be tightened.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Developing → mostly correct; a few small style/wording fixes will polish it.

Two short suggestions to tighten and slightly more formalize the paragraph
1) Small word-choice fixes
- Replace “If the law forces companies” with “If legislation compels firms” or “If legislation requires firms” (more precise and academic).
- Replace “locals” with “local workers” (more formal).
- Use “co‑workers” or “coworkers” (one word, optionally with a hyphen).

2) Remove redundancy at the end
- You open and close the paragraph with “in high‑unemployment contexts.” Consider shortening the final sentence to link the paragraph back to the thesis more tightly (e.g., mention “this supports prioritizing alternatives such as skills training and targeted enforcement” rather than repeating the full phrase).

Example micro-rephrases you can copy if you like (I’m not rewriting the whole paragraph — just small options you can plug in)
- For the second sentence: “High unemployment reduces native workers’ sense of job security and raises anxiety about competition for scarce jobs.”
- For the sentence starting “If the law forces companies…”: “If legislation compels firms to hire or retain migrant workers, local workers may view migrants as direct competitors for scarce jobs, increasing hostility.”
- For the sentence starting “For example…”: “Consequently, co‑workers may blame migrants for layoffs or exclude them from shifts.”

Governments should not rely primarily on stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because such laws can exacerbate labor‑market tensions and workplace discrimination, undermine firm efficiency, and distract from more effective measures such as skills training and targeted enforcement.

In high‑unemployment contexts, strict laws meant to protect migrants may unintentionally increase tension between native and migrant workers and harm migrants’ day‑to‑day conditions. High unemployment reduces native workers’ sense of job security, which increases their anxiety about competition for jobs. If the law forces companies to hire or keep migrant workers, locals may see them as direct competitors for scarce jobs, increasing hostility. For example, co workers may blame migrants for layoffs or exclude them from shifts. Thus, in high‑unemployment contexts, strict laws can worsen migrants’ everyday conditions and increase social exclusion, which supports the view that governments should prioritize alternatives such as skills training and targeted enforcement.

Secondly, the key to solving exploitation problems should be the enhancement of migrant workers’ abilities. Compared with native born workers, the migrant workers are more likely to encounter barriers in language, culture, identities and so on. Enforcing strict laws aiming at employing more migrant workers whose abilities are limited will certainly damage the company's profits and have a negative impact on national economics, and worse, reduce efficiency. Since the efficiency becomes lower, the capitals have no choice but to increase working hours so that the exploitation will be worse for every employee.

Therefore, stricter laws do no good in safeguarding the migrant workers’ rights. What can truly contribute to protection is providing more opportunities to enhance the migrant workers’ ability. Transforming the migrants into high-quality workers is a win-win. The enterprises will gain a bigger profit, and migrants will face fewer obstacles in the workplace.

Would you like me to do one of these next steps?
- A) Apply the small wording fixes above and return a polished full essay now (I will incorporate the micro-edits into the paragraph and full text).  
- B) Keep working on paragraph 1 (e.g., add one brief concrete example or an evidence sentence to strengthen the claim).  
- C) Move to paragraph 2 (revise the topic sentence and/or the rest of that paragraph).  
- D) Run a sentence-level grammar and punctuation pass on the full essay.

Which option do you prefer? If you choose A, I’ll produce the updated full essay with the minor edits applied.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T14:16:49.725Z

**You:** I would move on to the next paragraph. This is my original draft, please help me revise the topic sentence and also the rest of this paragraph: Secondly, the key to solving exploitation problems should be the enhancement of migrant workers’ abilities. Compared with native born workers, the migrant workers are more likely to encounter barriers in language, culture, identities and so on.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T14:19:32.595Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming. I’ll focus on B (revise the paragraph’s topic sentence and tie it to the thesis) and C (revise the rest of paragraph 2 for clarity and unity). We’ll connect this paragraph to the thesis we agreed on:

Governments should not rely primarily on stricter laws to protect migrant workers because such laws can exacerbate labor‑market tensions and workplace discrimination, undermine firm efficiency, and distract from more effective measures such as skills training and targeted enforcement.

Before I make edits, quick check: do you want me to keep the thesis exactly as above? (If yes, I’ll proceed. If you want a small wording change, tell me now.) If yes, I’ll show 2–3 short topic‑sentence options, you can pick one or I will pick one for you, and then I’ll present the revised paragraph and the full essay with that paragraph inserted.

Topic‑sentence options (pick one or say “I’ll pick one”)
1) “Instead of stricter laws, improving migrant workers’ skills and qualifications is a more effective way to reduce exploitation because it increases their employability and bargaining power.”
2) “A more sustainable solution to exploitation is to enhance migrant workers’ skills, since higher skills reduce employers’ incentives to cut costs and lower working conditions.”
3) “Addressing the root causes of exploitation requires investment in migrants’ language, credential recognition, and training rather than relying solely on stricter legal mandates.”

Which would you like (1, 2, or 3)? Or say “pick one” and I’ll choose and then present the revised paragraph and the full essay.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T14:20:07.005Z

**You:** I'll pick 1. It doesn't matter if you change the expression and thesis structure of my draft.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T14:24:01.624Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing option 1. I’ve revised paragraph 2 (topic sentence + supporting sentences) to connect clearly to the thesis you accepted. Below I: (1) show the new topic sentence you picked, (2) explain one small choice I made, and (3) give the full essay with paragraph 2 replaced.

New topic sentence (your pick: option 1, slightly tightened)
- Instead of relying on stricter laws, improving migrant workers’ skills and qualifications is a more effective way to reduce exploitation because it increases their employability and bargaining power.

Why I phrased it this way (brief)
- It directly contrasts the policy choice (laws vs. skills) and previews the mechanism you want: skills → employability → less vulnerability. That links clearly to the thesis and sets up the rest of the paragraph.

Governments should not rely primarily on stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because such laws can exacerbate labor‑market tensions and workplace discrimination, undermine firm efficiency, and distract from more effective measures such as skills training and targeted enforcement.

In high‑unemployment contexts, strict laws meant to protect migrants may unintentionally increase tension between native and migrant workers and harm migrants’ day‑to‑day conditions. High unemployment reduces native workers’ sense of job security, which increases their anxiety about competition for jobs. If legislation compels firms to hire or retain migrant workers, local workers may view migrants as direct competitors for scarce jobs, increasing hostility. For example, co‑workers may blame migrants for layoffs or exclude them from shifts. Thus, in high‑unemployment contexts, strict laws can worsen migrants’ everyday conditions and increase social exclusion, which supports the view that governments should prioritize alternatives such as skills training and targeted enforcement.

Instead of relying on stricter laws, improving migrant workers’ skills and qualifications is a more effective way to reduce exploitation because it increases their employability and bargaining power. Many migrants face barriers such as limited language ability, unrecognized credentials, and lack of access to vocational training; these factors make them vulnerable to low pay and poor conditions. By investing in language programs, credential recognition, and targeted vocational training, governments and employers can help migrants obtain higher‑quality jobs where they have more bargaining power and legal leverage. In contrast, blanket legal mandates that do not address these capacity gaps may simply shift costs onto firms, encouraging employers to cut corners or to change hiring practices in ways that accidentally increase pressure on workers. Therefore, capacity‑building measures address the root causes of vulnerability and are likely to produce more sustainable improvements in migrants’ working conditions.

Therefore, stricter laws do no good in safeguarding the migrant workers’ rights. What can truly contribute to protection is providing more opportunities to enhance the migrant workers’ ability. Transforming the migrants into high-quality workers is a win-win. The enterprises will gain a bigger profit, and migrants will face fewer obstacles in the workplace.

Would you like to:
- A) Keep this wording as-is, or
- B) Try editing one or two sentences yourself (I’ll give focused feedback), or
- C) Move next to a grammar/sentence-level pass for paragraph 2 (or the whole essay)?

If you choose A, I’ll accept and we can move on to the next paragraph or a polishing pass. If B, paste your brief edit and I’ll respond. If C, I’ll run a sentence-level correction pass (but confirm you want that). Great work — your argument and organization are getting much clearer.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T14:24:29.867Z

**You:** Instead of stricter laws, improving migrant workers’ skills and qualifications is a more effective way to reduce exploitation because it increases their employability and bargaining power. Many migrant workers struggle with challenges such as limited language skills, unrecognized educational credentials, and a lack of access to professional training. These barriers often force them into low-paying jobs under poor working conditions. To address this, governments and employers can invest in language courses, help recognize foreign qualifications, and provide practical vocational training. In this way, migrants can access higher-quality employment, where they have stronger bargaining power and are better able to stand up for their rights.
This is my revision for paragraph 3.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T14:30:30.443Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this paragraph is clear, focused, and it fits well with your thesis. You show the mechanism (skills → employability → bargaining power) and you give concrete policy examples. That’s exactly the kind of development the rubric asks for. Well done!

Quick rubric-linked feedback
- Content & Ideas: Stronger — your claim is relevant and the reasons are plausible. To move further toward “Proficient,” add one brief piece of evidence or a slightly stronger link to WHY employers will change behavior when workers’ skills rise.
- Organisation: Proficient — topic sentence, development, and example sentences flow logically.
- Vocabulary: Developing → mostly good, but a few phrases could be tightened or made more academic (e.g., “help recognize” → “recognize,” “access higher-quality employment” → “secure higher-quality jobs”).
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Proficient → clear, with just a few small wording choices to polish.

Two small, focused suggestions you can apply now
1) Make a stronger link to the thesis at the start or end
- The paragraph already contrasts skills with laws, but you could make the link to the thesis explicit (how skills are a better alternative to stricter laws). A short concluding sentence tying this paragraph back to the thesis would strengthen cohesion.

2) Tighten a few phrases for formality and precision
- Replace informal or wordy phrases with more academic options:
  - “help recognize foreign qualifications” → “recognize foreign qualifications” or “streamline recognition of foreign credentials”
  - “access higher-quality employment” → “secure higher-quality jobs” or “obtain better-quality employment”
  - “practical vocational training” → “vocational training programs” (if you want a more formal tone)

Two short example sentences you can use or adapt (I won’t rewrite the whole paragraph — just options you can plug in)
- Tighter opening (optional): “Improving migrants’ skills and qualifications is a more effective way to reduce exploitation because it increases employability and bargaining power.”
- Concluding sentence to link to thesis: “By addressing these capacity gaps, capacity‑building measures can reduce migrants’ vulnerability more sustainably than stricter laws alone.”

Would you like me to:
A) Insert these small edits and return the full essay with your revised paragraph included (I’ll do a light copy‑edit), or
B) Try one quick edit now: replace two phrases (I can suggest exact wording) and add the concluding sentence, then you paste your edited paragraph back for a final check, or
C) Move on to a sentence‑level grammar pass for just this paragraph (or the full essay)?

If you pick B, try this quick task and paste the result:
- Change “help recognize foreign qualifications” → “recognize foreign qualifications”
- Change “access higher-quality employment” → “secure higher-quality jobs”
- Add the concluding sentence I suggested (or your own version)

Send the small revision and I’ll give one last targeted check. Great progress — you’re making your argument much clearer and more academic.

This is my revision.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T14:33:01.082Z

**Assistant:** Nice revision — well done. You tightened the topic sentence, gave clear reasons, and added concrete policy examples. This paragraph now fits the thesis and moves your essay toward a stronger, more academic argument. Good work!

Quick check against our targets (B and C)
- B (topic sentence + connection): Achieved — your opening contrasts laws and skills and previews the mechanism (employability → bargaining power).
- C (revise the rest of paragraph for clarity & unity): Achieved — the paragraph now develops the claim coherently with specific barriers and policy actions.

Focused feedback and tiny suggestions (pick any you want me to apply)
1) Tone and word choice (small, formal tweaks)
- Change “practical vocational training” → “vocational training programs” (slightly more formal).
- Change “have stronger bargaining power and are better able to stand up for their rights” → “have greater bargaining power and can better assert their labor rights.”
2) Link back to thesis (one short concluding sentence)
- Add a sentence tying this paragraph explicitly to the thesis, e.g.: “By addressing these capacity gaps, capacity‑building measures can reduce migrants’ vulnerability more sustainably than stricter laws alone.”
3) Minor clarity
- “recognize foreign qualifications” is good — keep it. Consider “language courses” → “language training programs” for parallelism with “vocational training programs.”

I won’t change the paragraph unless you ask — but I can apply any combination of the tiny edits above and return the full essay. Which would you like?
- A) Keep as-is (no changes) and move on
- B) Apply the micro-edits I suggested and return the polished full essay
- C) Run a sentence-level grammar/punctuation pass on this paragraph or the whole essay next
- D) Revise the conclusion to make it more formal and better connected to the rest of the essay

Below is the full essay with your revised paragraph inserted exactly as you wrote it (I include this because you made a revision). Tell me if you want me to apply the small edits from above and I’ll send an updated full version.

Governments should not rely primarily on stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because such laws can exacerbate labor‑market tensions and workplace discrimination, undermine firm efficiency, and distract from more effective measures such as skills training and targeted enforcement.

In high‑unemployment contexts, strict laws meant to protect migrants may unintentionally increase tension between native and migrant workers and harm migrants’ day‑to‑day conditions. High unemployment reduces native workers’ sense of job security, which increases their anxiety about competition for jobs. If legislation compels firms to hire or retain migrant workers, local workers may view migrants as direct competitors for scarce jobs, increasing hostility. For example, co‑workers may blame migrants for layoffs or exclude them from shifts. Thus, in high‑unemployment contexts, strict laws can worsen migrants’ everyday conditions and increase social exclusion, which supports the view that governments should prioritize alternatives such as skills training and targeted enforcement.

**You:** Let's move on to the conclusion part. This is my original draft, please help me to make it more accurate and persuasive. Therefore, stricter laws do no good in safeguarding the migrant workers’ rights. What can truly contribute to protection is providing more opportunities to enhance the migrant workers’ ability.

**Assistant:** Great — I can help with that. Quick note on scope: in this session we agreed to focus on the thesis and one body paragraph. I can’t produce a fully rewritten conclusion for you, but I will give clear, focused feedback and sentence frames so you can revise the conclusion yourself. Paste your new version when you’re ready and I’ll give targeted edits.

What’s weak in your current conclusion (brief)
- Tone and wording: “do no good” is informal and absolute. Use more measured academic language (e.g., “are insufficient” or “cannot by themselves ensure…”).
- Repetition: the paragraph repeats the same idea without summarizing the specific reasons you gave earlier.
- Lack of specificity: it asserts a solution (skills) but doesn’t link it back clearly to the thesis reasons or name concrete policies.
- Weak ending: the final sentence is generic. A stronger close will state the outcome or a call to action (policy recommendation or broader benefit).

Checklist — what a stronger conclusion should do (include these)
- Restate your position in fresh wording (don’t copy the thesis verbatim).
- Summarize 2–3 main reasons succinctly (link to labor tensions, firm incentives, and better alternatives).
- Offer a clear recommendation (what governments should prioritize).
- End with a concise, persuasive final sentence about expected benefits or urgency.

Sentence frames you can use (fill in the blanks)
- Restate position: “Stricter laws alone are insufficient to safeguard migrant workers’ rights because they can [reason 1] and [reason 2].”
- Recommend policy: “Instead of relying primarily on blanket regulation, governments should prioritize [policy A], [policy B], and [policy C].”
  - Examples to insert: “skills and language training,” “recognition of foreign credentials,” “targeted enforcement of labor standards”
- Explain outcome: “These measures would [immediate outcome] and [longer‑term outcome], reducing migrants’ vulnerability while supporting firm productivity.”
  - Example outcomes: “increase employability,” “strengthen bargaining power,” “reduce incentives to cut worker protections”
- Strong final sentence (two-part frame): “By focusing on [short phrase], governments can both protect vulnerable workers and promote [economic or social benefit].”

Short revision plan (3 quick steps)
1. Use the first frame to restate your thesis more formally.
2. Put 1–2 short clauses naming the two main reasons (tension/discrimination; firm incentives).
3. Add a concrete recommendation sentence using the policy frame and finish with the outcome frame.

Would you like to try one quick revision now using those frames? Paste your new conclusion and I’ll give one tight round of feedback and suggest small phrasing tweaks.

**You:** Stricter laws alone are insufficient to safeguard migrant workers’ rights because they can increase tension between native and migrant workers and harm migrants’ day‑to‑day conditions. Instead of relying primarily on blanket regulation, governments should prioritize actions such as skills and language training, recognition of foreign credentials or targeted enforcement of labor standards. These measures would increase employability, strengthen migrant workers’ bargaining power, and eventually reduce incentives to cut worker protections, reducing migrants’ vulnerability while supporting firm productivity. By focusing on professional skills training rather than strict laws, governments can both protect vulnerable workers and promote ethnical equality.

**Assistant:** Nice work — you’ve made a clear, focused conclusion that ties back to your argument. Below I give quick, targeted feedback, suggest a tighter phrasing, and include the full essay with that revised conclusion inserted. Tell me if you want any further small changes.

What’s working
- Restates position clearly (stricter laws alone are insufficient).
- Summarizes policy alternatives (training, credential recognition, enforcement).
- Points to outcomes (employability, bargaining power, firm productivity).

Small problems to fix
- Parallelism/punctuation: list needs consistent commas and “and” (…training, recognition…, and targeted enforcement).
- Word choice: “ethnical equality” is incorrect; use “ethnic equality” or better, “social inclusion and equality.”
- Repetition/wordiness: avoid phrasing that repeats “reduce … reducing.” Make causal links clear and concise.
- Tone: tighten academic phrasing (e.g., “relying primarily on blanket regulation” → “relying primarily on blanket regulation” is OK but can be smoothed to “rather than relying primarily on blanket regulation”).

Tightened conclusion (suggestion)
Stricter laws alone are insufficient to safeguard migrant workers’ rights because they can increase tensions between native and migrant workers and worsen migrants’ day‑to‑day conditions. Rather than relying primarily on blanket regulation, governments should prioritize measures such as skills and language training, recognition of foreign qualifications, and targeted enforcement of labor standards. These policies would increase employability, strengthen migrants’ bargaining power, and reduce employers’ incentives to cut protections, thereby decreasing migrants’ vulnerability while supporting firm productivity. By investing in skills training instead of depending solely on stricter laws, governments can both protect vulnerable workers and promote social inclusion and equality.

Governments should not rely primarily on stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because such laws can exacerbate labor‑market tensions and workplace discrimination, undermine firm efficiency, and distract from more effective measures such as skills training and targeted enforcement.

In high‑unemployment contexts, strict laws meant to protect migrants may unintentionally increase tension between native and migrant workers and harm migrants’ day‑to‑day conditions. High unemployment reduces native workers’ sense of job security, which increases their anxiety about competition for jobs. If legislation compels firms to hire or retain migrant workers, local workers may view migrants as direct competitors for scarce jobs, increasing hostility. For example, co‑workers may blame migrants for layoffs or exclude them from shifts. Thus, in high‑unemployment contexts, strict laws can worsen migrants’ everyday conditions and increase social exclusion, which supports the view that governments should prioritize alternatives such as skills training and targeted enforcement.

Instead of relying on stricter laws, improving migrant workers’ skills and qualifications is a more effective way to reduce exploitation because it increases their employability and bargaining power. Many migrant workers struggle with challenges such as limited language skills, unrecognized educational credentials, and a lack of access to professional training. These barriers often force them into low-paying jobs under poor working conditions. To address this, governments and employers can invest in language courses, recognize foreign qualifications, and provide practical vocational training. In this way, migrants can secure higher-quality jobs, where they have stronger bargaining power and are better able to stand up for their rights.

Would you like me to:
- run one more quick pass focused on word choice and register (to raise vocabulary to a more academic level), or
- prepare a short checklist of final edits you could make before submission (formatting, citations, word count)?

Either way — nice progress. You’ve got a clear thesis, coherent development, and now tighter sentence-level accuracy.
