            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your draft and our chat history. Here is a concise summary and constructive advice to help you complete your essay revision effectively:

---

### Summary of Your Current Revision Status

- You have a clear main claim: automation improves long-term global employment prospects.
- You identified two supporting reasons: increased efficiency and liberation from repetitive jobs leading to upskilling.
- However, your submitted revision contains placeholders ("let's pretend we have revised...") instead of actual revised sentences.
- The assistant provided a clear, step-by-step revision plan: first revise the thesis, then topic sentences, then body paragraph.
- You engaged in the revision workflow but did not submit the concrete rewritten text as requested.
- Grammar and vocabulary issues from your original draft remain uncorrected.
- The flow and coherence in your revised draft are disrupted by meta-comments and filler text.

---

### Key Next Steps

To complete your revision and demonstrate improvement, please produce and submit the following:

1. **Revised Thesis Statement**  
   Write one confident, grammatically correct sentence that clearly states your position and previews your two main reasons.  
   Example template:  
   *“Automation enhances long-term global employment prospects by increasing efficiency and enabling workers to acquire higher-level skills.”*  
   Feel free to write your own version first; I can then help refine it.

2. **Revised Topic Sentence for Body Paragraph #1**  
   Create a clear topic sentence that links this paragraph directly to your thesis, focusing on efficiency.  
   Example:  
   *“First, automation boosts employment by increasing firms’ production efficiency, which can create new job opportunities.”*

3. **Rewritten Body Paragraph #1 Content**  
   Rewrite the paragraph to improve sentence clarity, correct grammar errors, fix awkward vocabulary (e.g., use “number of jobs” instead of “amounts of jobs”), and include at least one concrete example or hypothetical illustrating how efficiency gains can lead to job growth.  
   Aim for clear logical flow and avoid repetition.

---

### Tips for Your Revision

- **Grammar Focus:** Check subject–verb agreement (e.g., “automation enhances,” not “enhance”), article use (“a number of jobs”), and verb forms (“may reduce jobs,” not “make someone loss jobs”).
- **Word Choice:** Use precise collocations: “number of jobs,” “lose jobs,” “mass production” instead of “standard produce.”
- **Sentence Clarity:** Break long sentences into shorter, clearer ones; avoid filler words or meta-comments inside your essay.
- **Evidence:** Add a concrete example or statistic if possible, e.g., reference how factory automation led to growth in tech jobs, or hypothesize how machines free workers for skilled tasks.
- **Tone:** Use formal academic style; avoid “I think” or conversational phrases.

---

### How to Proceed

1. Compose your **revised thesis** sentence and post it here.
2. Once it looks good, write the **revised topic sentence for paragraph #1**.
3. Then rewrite the **full body paragraph #1**.
4. I can review each step, suggest edits, and help polish your writing.

---

You are capable of doing this! By focusing on actual sentence revisions rather than placeholders, your essay will improve both in clarity and persuasiveness. Just let me know when you’re ready to start with the thesis rewrite.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The essay presents a clear central claim (automation improves long‑term global employment prospects) and gives two basic mechanisms (efficiency gains; freeing people from repetitive jobs to upskill). However ideas are general and underdeveloped; there is little concrete evidence or specific examples to support cause‑and‑effect claims.
  - Evidence: Thesis idea: “I think automation actually enhance global employment prospects in the long term.” Reasons explained: “it will stimulate humans to learn more knowledge and enhance their skills” and “it will boost efficiency and liberate humans from repetitive jobs.”
- Organization: 17/25 - The essay has paragraph divisions (intro, two body paragraphs, conclusion) and repeated linking to the main claim, but paragraphs are repetitive and the logical progression is weak. Topic sentences are sometimes unclear or redundant.
  - Evidence: Both body paragraphs repeat similar ideas about efficiency and liberation without clear development or transitions: “Automation and the technological shift can boost efficiency.” … then later “In the other hand, automation and the technological shift can liberate humans from repetitive jobs…”
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - The vocabulary is adequate to communicate the main ideas but there are frequent collocation and word-choice errors (“amounts of jobs,” “loss jobs,” “standard produce”) and limited academic register or variety.
  - Evidence: Phrases like “amounts of jobs and tasks,” “standard produce,” “have low possible to have trouble” show limited precision.
- Grammar: 15/25 - Frequent grammar and sentence-structure errors (subject–verb agreement, articles, pluralization, word order) sometimes reduce clarity but overall meaning remains accessible.
  - Evidence: “automation actually enhance” (subject–verb), “they up to the used life” (awkward phrasing), “it will be improved because it will stimulate humans to learn more knowledge” (word choice/structure).
- **Original Essay Total: 65/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The revised submission does not contain substantive content changes. The same main claim and reasons remain, but are interspersed with meta placeholders (“let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement,” “bla bla bla”) rather than actual revisions or new evidence.
  - Evidence: Beginning: “I think automation actually enhance global employment prospects in the long term.let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on  bla bla bla ...ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1 (revised thesis statement here)” — no actual revised thesis provided.
- Organization: 16/25 - The structure is unchanged but the addition of placeholders and repeated meta-comments breaks flow; paragraphs contain filler text and therefore are less coherent than the original.
  - Evidence: Repeated “revised the topic sentences bla bla bla...” interrupts paragraph flow and coherence.
- Vocabulary: 14/25 - Vocabulary issues from the original remain and the placeholders further degrade register and clarity; no improved variety or precision is shown.
  - Evidence: Same problematic collocations remain; filler tokens (“bla bla bla”) reduce quality.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Grammar errors persist; no corrected sentences are supplied despite the assistant’s clear guidance. The inserted meta-text does not fix subject–verb agreement or other errors.
  - Evidence: The original error remains: “I think automation actually enhance…” Also inconsistent punctuation and sentence boundaries.
- **Revised Essay Total: 61/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -4 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - No substantive textual improvements were actually made to thesis, topic sentence, or body paragraph content.
  - Student engaged in the revision workflow (selected paragraph #1 to revise), indicating awareness of the process.
  - The structure (paragraph boundaries) remained intact.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The student did not produce a corrected thesis statement. A stronger thesis could have been: “Automation enhances long‑term global employment prospects by increasing production efficiency and enabling workers to move into higher‑skill roles.”
  - The topic sentence for paragraph #1 was not revised into a clearer, thesis-linked sentence (e.g., “First, automation raises long‑term employment prospects by increasing firms’ efficiency and output, which can create new jobs.”).
  - The body paragraph #1 was not rewritten to fix grammar, improve cohesion, or add concrete examples/evidence (statistics, case studies, or hypothetical scenarios).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 11** (11 messages in the chat log between student and assistant)
- **Conversation Quality:** Moderate procedural guidance from the assistant with repeated prompts and a clear three‑step revision plan. The student provided very limited substantive input: short acceptance lines (“let's pretend we have revised...,” “k let's revise the rest...”) and did not supply the requested revised thesis, topic sentence, or paragraph content. The interaction therefore shows planning and guidance but minimal implementation.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Developing
  - Justification: The chat contains a moderate number of exchanges (11), and the assistant provided detailed, multi-step guidance (e.g., stepwise plan: revise thesis → revise topic sentence → revise paragraph). However, the student’s contributions were brief and largely non‑substantive (e.g., “let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on  bla bla bla ...”), so the dialogue did not reach deeper analytical or iterative levels expected for an excellent score.
  - Evidence: The assistant repeatedly asks the student to craft a new thesis using a template; the student never posts a revised thesis.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - Basic
  - Justification: The student accepted the assistant’s suggested process but did not critically evaluate or challenge recommendations, nor did they justify any choices. There are no examples of the student weighing alternatives or rejecting AI suggestions.
  - Evidence: Student replies are mostly procedural or non‑committal (“let's pretend...”), with no evaluative comments on the assistant’s proposed thesis templates or wording.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - Basic
  - Justification: The assistant proposed a multi-step iterative revision process, and the student selected a paragraph to revise, but the student did not carry out the iterative edits (no revised sentences submitted). There is insufficient evidence of multiple meaningful revision cycles.
  - Evidence: Assistant: “Step 1 — Thesis statement … Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now?” Student: “ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1   bla bla bla” — no actual rewrites provided.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student has a clear, defendable central claim and can articulate two plausible mechanisms (efficiency; freeing workers for better jobs). Evidence: thesis line and paragraph explanations in the original essay.
- The assistant provided a clear, pedagogically sound revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) and specific, actionable guidance (templates and grammar targets).
- The student engaged with the AI enough to select a focus (body paragraph #1), showing ability to follow a revision workflow.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- The student must perform and submit actual revisions rather than placeholders. Specific action: produce a confident one‑sentence thesis, a revised topic sentence for paragraph #1, and a rewritten body paragraph incorporating grammar fixes and clearer development.
- Add concrete examples and evidence: cite a statistic, a historical example, or a brief hypothetical to clarify how efficiency gains or upskilling create jobs.
- Address frequent grammar and vocabulary errors: subject–verb agreement (“automation enhances”), collocations (“number of jobs” instead of “amounts of jobs”), article usage, and clearer sentence structure.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the original essay and a clear target (chose body paragraph #1), which gave the assistant necessary context to offer focused guidance.
  - Evidence: Student pasted the essay and later said, “k let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1.”
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The assistant proposed an effective plan and the student accepted the plan; however, the student did not complete planned steps.
  - Evidence: The assistant’s three-step plan is explicit and repeated; the student followed process but did not implement changes.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student did not demonstrate critique of or selective acceptance of AI suggestions.
  - Evidence: No examples where the student rejected or revised an AI suggestion; instead, the student replied with placeholders (“let’s pretend we have revised…”).
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The student did not independently produce revised text; actual editing work is missing.
  - Evidence: No revised thesis, topic sentence, or paragraph content submitted.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Complete the three required revision tasks concretely: (a) post a confident, grammatically correct thesis that previews two reasons; (b) write a revised topic sentence for paragraph #1 that links to the thesis; (c) rewrite body paragraph #1 addressing sentence clarity, grammar, and adding at least one concrete example.
2. Use the assistant’s template but produce your own wording first; then ask for targeted edits. For example: “My new thesis: ‘Automation enhances long‑term global employment prospects by increasing efficiency and enabling worker upskilling.’ Please correct grammar and make it stronger.”
3. Focus a revision pass on grammar and collocations: search and correct subject–verb agreement, article usage, pluralization, and common collocations (e.g., “a number of jobs,” “lose jobs,” “mass production” rather than “standard produce”).
4. When revising with AI, show evidence of critical evaluation: if you accept a suggestion, explain why; if you reject it, give a reason or propose an alternative.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student engaged in the revision planning stage and selected a paragraph to revise, which is positive. However, the student did not complete the actual textual revisions requested by the assistant (no revised thesis, topic sentence, or paragraph submitted). Because the assignment asked for concrete revisions, the current submission is incomplete.
- Suggested instructor action: Request that the student submit the three concrete revisions (thesis, topic sentence, revised paragraph) and show one round of edits responding to specific AI feedback. Grade accordingly once the substantive revisions are provided.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
I think automation actually enhance global
employment prospects in the long term.
  Although this technological shift may reduce jobs so that people could not find jobs in the short term,in the long term, it will be improved because it will stimulate humans to learn more knowledge and enhance their skills. What’s more, it will boost efficiency and liberate humans from repetitive jobs, so it will enhance global employment prospects.
  Automation and the technological shift can boost efficiency. There are amounts of jobs and tasks should be done a day, they cannot be finished if only rely on humans, because humans have the emotion of tired and bored. However, the machine will never feel tired, so they can continue working until they up to the used life. Besides, the machine can standard produce, and have low possible to have trouble or problems so that it could promise the producing efficiency.
  In the other hand, automation and the technological shift can liberate humans from repetitive jobs and then stimulate them to improve themselves. As we all know, there are various of repetitive and boring jobs in the world like packing. If humans do these jobs for long times, they will feel bored and tired, reducing the efficiency even not thinking anymore. However, if we use technology and AI, it is easy to liberate humans from these boring jobs. Maybe it will make someone loss jobs, but it is this to help them improve themselves. Because they have to learn more knowledge to find other high quality jobs. It is
not only an opportunity to boost efficiency, but also an opportunity to make humans better and better.
  All in all, in my view, I think automation and technological shift enhance global employment prospect. It can not only boost the efficiency, but also make our humans become better and better.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-23T08:37:53.577Z

**You:** I think automation actually enhance global employment prospects in the long term.

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:07:15.480Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for sharing your draft and that thesis line. Before we start revising, let’s set clear targets so our session focuses on what you most want to improve.

1) Quick goal check
- What do you most want to work on today? (Pick any one or two)
  - clarity and sentence-level grammar (verb agreement, word choice, punctuation)
  - thesis strength and focus (clear answer + preview of main points)
  - argument and development (stronger reasons and specific evidence/examples)
  - paragraph structure and coherence (topic sentences that link to thesis)
  - style and academic tone (avoid hedging, more formal wording)

Tell me which one or two you prefer to focus on.

2) Brief diagnostic feedback (using simple rubric categories)
- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: You take a clear position that automation enhances long‑term employment.
  - Areas to improve: The thesis is hedged (“I think”) and has grammar problems (“automation actually enhance”). It doesn’t preview the main reasons you’ll use to support the claim.

- Organization
  - Strengths: You have a clear paragraph division and repeated concluding statement.
  - Areas to improve: Paragraphs repeat similar ideas and sometimes drift; topic sentences could link more explicitly to the thesis’s promised reasons.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: You attempt to explain mechanisms (efficiency, freeing workers for higher‑skill tasks).
  - Areas to improve: Claims are broad and general—no specific examples, data, or clear cause-and-effect explanation. Some sentences are unclear, weakening the support.

- Language Use (grammar, word choice, clarity)
  - Strengths: Ideas are understandable; good use of transition words (“Besides,” “However”).
  - Areas to improve: Frequent grammar and vocabulary errors (verb forms, articles, plural/singular, word choice like “amounts of jobs,” “loss jobs,” “standard produce”), awkward phrasing, and punctuation issues.

3) Choose your priorities
Which of the diagnosed issues do you want to focus on in this revision session? (Please pick up to two — for example: “thesis strength + one paragraph’s topic sentence and content,” or “grammar + paragraph coherence.”)

Once you confirm, we’ll move into Step 1: working on your thesis. I see your current thesis sentence (“I think automation actually enhance global employment prospects in the long term.”) — we’ll revise it together to be grammatically correct, confident, and to preview your main points, but I’ll ask you to try a rewrite after I give brief, targeted feedback. Which targets do you want to focus on?

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:07:46.362Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on  bla bla bla ...

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:18:15.524Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for the draft. I’ll guide you through the negotiated revision process, step by step. First we need to pick clear targets for this session.

1) Quick goal check — choose up to two targets to focus on now
Which of these would you most like to work on? (Pick one or two)
- clarity and sentence‑level grammar (verb agreement, word choice, punctuation)
- thesis strength and focus (clear answer + preview of main points)
- argument and development (stronger reasons and specific examples)
- paragraph structure and coherence (topic sentences that link to thesis)
- style and academic tone (avoid hedging, more formal wording)

Tell me which one or two you want to focus on.

2) Brief diagnostic summary (short and focused)
- Thesis & Argument: Clear position, but hedged (“I think”), grammar errors (“automation actually enhance”), and no preview of main reasons.
- Organization: Paragraphing is logical, but ideas repeat and topic sentences don’t always link clearly to a thesis that previews points.
- Evidence & Development: Good general mechanisms (efficiency; freeing workers for higher‑skill jobs) but claims are vague and lack concrete examples or clearer cause–effect explanation.
- Language Use: Many grammar and word‑choice errors (verb forms, articles, plurals, collocations like “amounts of jobs,” “loss jobs,” “standard produce”), and punctuation issues; tone is informal.

3) Pick your priorities
Please tell me which one or two of the targets above you want to work on in this session. Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 1 (thesis revision). I already have your current thesis: “I think automation actually enhance global employment prospects in the long term.” If you choose “thesis strength,” we’ll revise that together; if you choose “grammar,” we’ll focus on sentence corrections as we revise. Which do you pick?

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:18:26.746Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on bla bla bla...

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:24:41.655Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a helpful draft. Before we start the three-step revision, let’s agree targets and confirm what you want to focus on.

1) Quick choice: pick up to two targets (reply with one or two)
- clarity and sentence-level grammar (verb agreement, word choice, punctuation)
- thesis strength and focus (clear answer + preview of main points)
- argument and development (stronger reasons and specific examples)
- paragraph structure and coherence (topic sentences that link to thesis)
- style and academic tone (avoid hedging, more formal wording)

Which one or two would you like to work on now?

2) Short diagnostic summary (based on the rubric categories)
- Thesis & Argument: Clear position, but hedged (“I think”), grammar error (“automation actually enhance”), and it doesn’t preview the main reasons.
- Organization: Paragraphs are separated logically, but topic sentences and transitions don’t always link tightly to a thesis that previews points; ideas repeat.
- Evidence & Development: Good general reasons (efficiency; freeing workers for higher-skill work) but examples and explanation are vague; cause–effect needs clearer linking.
- Language Use: Many grammar and word-choice problems (verb forms, articles, plurals, collocations like “amounts of jobs,” “loss jobs,” “standard produce”), and punctuation issues; tone is informal.

3) If you choose “paragraph structure and coherence” (or organization), please tell me which body paragraph you want to work on:
- Paragraph A: Efficiency / machines work longer and more consistently (first body paragraph)
- Paragraph B: Liberation from repetitive jobs and upskilling / new opportunities (second body paragraph)

4) After you pick targets (and a paragraph if relevant), we’ll start Step 1: thesis revision. I already have your current thesis: “I think automation actually enhance global employment prospects in the long term.” If you choose “thesis strength,” I’ll give quick feedback and then ask you to try a revised thesis before I model or suggest phrasing.

Which targets do you choose, and which paragraph (if any) do you want to revise?

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:25:05.011Z

**You:** k let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:25:38.228Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. Just to confirm: you want to revise body paragraph #1 (the paragraph about efficiency). For this session, I suggest we focus on two targets:
- paragraph structure and coherence (make the paragraph clearly connect to the thesis and stay focused), and
- sentence‑level clarity and grammar (fix verb forms, word choice, punctuation).

Is that okay? If yes, we’ll follow the three-step process. Step 1 is the thesis — we’ll revise that first so the paragraph links to it clearly.

Step 1 — Thesis statement
- Please paste your current thesis (I have: “I think automation actually enhance global employment prospects in the long term.”). 
- Quick feedback on that version: remove hedging (“I think”); fix subject–verb agreement (“automation … enhances”); make it preview your main reasons (for example: efficiency gains and the shift to higher‑skill work).
- A short template you can use to try: “Automation [strong verb] long‑term global employment prospects by [reason 1] and [reason 2].”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Type one confident, one‑sentence thesis using the template (or your own wording), and then we’ll move to Step 2 (topic sentence for paragraph #1).

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:26:01.838Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1   bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:26:56.287Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m ready to revise paragraph 1 with you. Before we do that, we need to finish Step 1: revise your thesis so the paragraph can link clearly to it.

Please do one thing now:
- Write one confident, one‑sentence thesis using this template:
  "Automation [strong verb] long‑term global employment prospects by [reason 1] and [reason 2]."

Suggested reasons you can use: increasing efficiency (so firms grow/produce more) and freeing workers for higher‑skill jobs (upskilling / new job creation). Avoid hedging (no "I think") and fix subject–verb agreement ("automation enhances").

Would you like to try writing that thesis now? If you want, I can show one model after you try.
