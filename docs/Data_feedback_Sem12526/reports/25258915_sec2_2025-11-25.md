            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for continuing! Since you confirmed, please paste your current thesis statement here so I can give focused feedback and help you revise it.

Just to recap, your revised thesis should:  
- State your stance clearly and confidently (avoid “I think” or “I believe”)  
- Name the actor and action (e.g., governments must enact and enforce protective laws)  
- Preview 2–3 main points you will develop (e.g., preventing exploitation, fostering social stability, balancing business concerns)  
- Be one clear, concise sentence  

When you post your draft thesis, I’ll help refine it quickly. After that, we’ll proceed to revise the topic sentence of the second body paragraph, as you requested. Looking forward to your thesis draft!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The original (climate-change) draft presents a clear position (“I partly agree… citizens can still influence the government”) and two main ideas (influence on policy; personal lifestyle choices). However ideas are only moderately developed and sometimes repetitive or vague (e.g., “people don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen”).
- Organization: 18/25 - Reasonable paragraphing and a logical sequence (intro → two body paragraphs → counterargument → conclusion), but some transitions and internal coherence are weak and a few sentences break flow.
- Vocabulary: 17/25 - Basic, appropriate word choice but limited range and some awkward collocations (“is not really enough to help the climate problem”).
- Grammar: 16/25 - Frequent grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures that occasionally impede clarity (e.g., “But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action”).
- **Original Essay Total: 69/100**

Evidence (original):
- Thesis: “I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”
- Example of grammar/clarity issue: “But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action.”

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 23/25 - The revised essay (migrant-worker topic) has a clear, focused thesis that previews reasons: “Governments must enact and enforce targeted laws to protect migrant workers’ rights—including setting maximum weekly working hours and guaranteeing fair wages—to prevent employer exploitation, foster social stability, and strike a balanced approach between worker protection and business sustainability.” Ideas are developed with relevant examples and concrete policy suggestions (e.g., “a 48-hour weekly limit with double pay for extra hours”).
- Organization: 23/25 - Strong structure: clear intro with thesis, well-signposted body paragraphs (“Firstly…”, “Secondly…”), counterargument and a concise conclusion. Logical progression and better linking between ideas.
- Vocabulary: 22/25 - More precise and topic-appropriate lexicon (“enact and enforce,” “guarantee fair wages,” “social stability,” “corporate profits”), with fewer colloquialisms.
- Grammar: 21/25 - Mostly accurate sentence structures and formal academic tone. Minor punctuation/format issues (e.g., missing final period in the conclusion line) but no major errors that impede understanding.
- **Revised Essay Total: 89/100**

Evidence (revised):
- Revised thesis: “Governments must enact and enforce targeted laws to protect migrant workers’ rights—including setting maximum weekly working hours and guaranteeing fair wages—to prevent employer exploitation, foster social stability, and strike a balanced approach between worker protection and business sustainability.”
- Revised topic sentence (2nd body): “Secondly, protecting migrant workers is key to maintaining social stability.”
- Concrete example: “a 48-hour weekly limit with double pay for extra hours would ensure workers have enough rest and earn reasonable incomes.”

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +20 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis clarity and preview: The revised thesis explicitly names the action, protections, and three benefits (prevention of exploitation, social stability, economic balance).
  - Stronger organization and signposting: Clear “Firstly/Secondly” structure and explicit counterargument make the argument easier to follow.
  - More precise vocabulary and concrete policy example (48-hour limit, overtime pay) which strengthens persuasiveness.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Empirical evidence: Add a statistic, citation or brief real-world example (country or law) to strengthen claims about impact.
  - Counterargument development: The counterargument about business costs is present but could be expanded with specifics (how costs can be mitigated, phased implementation).
  - Proofreading polish: small punctuation/format issues and one missing final period; also ensure consistent formal voice throughout metadata lines (name/ID lines could be separated from essay text).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges:** 9 turns (assistant and user back-and-forths)
- **Conversation Quality:** Task-focused, assistant gave clear scaffolding (thesis checklist, phrasing suggestions, stepwise plan). The student followed direction and requested specific help (topic sentences, second body paragraph). Interaction was productive but limited in iteration depth.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Developing. Evidence: multiple substantive prompts from the assistant (thesis checklist, recommended phrases) and the student’s targeted requests (“the second body paragraph, please”, “OK, please. revise the topic sentences”), but total exchange count is modest (9 turns) and did not include many rounds of back-and-forth drafts.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 - Developing. Evidence: the student directed the focus (requested second paragraph and topic sentences), indicating selective acceptance of guidance. However, chat lacks explicit instances where the student critically evaluated or rejected particular AI suggestions with reasoned justification.
- **Refining Process**: 3/5 - Developing. Evidence: there is a clear move from an original draft to a revised essay with improved thesis and paragraphs, showing the assistant’s guidance was applied. But the chat shows limited iterative cycles (the assistant requested the student try a revised thesis, but a student draft of the thesis is not visible in chat turns), so the iterative loop is incomplete in the recorded conversation.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 9/15**

Stepwise interaction evidence:
- Assistant provided explicit checklists and examples for thesis revision (“state the stance… name protections... preview 2–3 main points”).
- Student repeatedly asked the assistant to revise specific elements (topic sentences, paragraph 2).
- Final revised essay reflects the assistant’s recommended structure and language.

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear uptake of structure and thesis guidance — the revised thesis tightly matches the assistant’s checklist and previews the essay’s main points.
- Effective paragraph-level revision — topic sentences (“Firstly…”, “Secondly…”) and body development are more focused and concrete in the revised essay.
- Good use of targeted vocabulary and policy examples (e.g., “48-hour weekly limit,” “double pay for extra hours”), which improves persuasiveness.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Strengthen evidence base: incorporate at least one concrete statistic, law, or real-world example to support claims.
- Increase iterative engagement with the AI: paste intermediate revisions (thesis draft, revised topic sentence) into chat for quick targeted feedback and further refinement.
- Deepen critical evaluation of AI suggestions: explicitly accept/reject suggestions with reasons to demonstrate evaluative judgment and learning.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Good - Student provided full essay text and indicated which paragraph to revise; however, the chat does not show the student attempting the assistant’s suggested thesis rewrite in the conversation itself (the final revised thesis appears in document upload rather than as an intermediate chat turn).
- Strategic Planning: Good - Student followed the assistant’s stepwise plan (thesis → topic sentences → paragraph), demonstrating a structured revision approach.
- Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement to Developing - Some direction-setting by the student but limited explicit critique or independent justification shown in chat when evaluating AI suggestions.
- Independent Editing: Good - The final revised essay shows independent application of suggestions, indicating capacity for self-editing with AI support.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Add empirical support: include one or two citations, statistics, or concrete legal examples (e.g., a country policy or NGO report) to substantiate claims about exploitation or social stability.
2. Use more iterative chat turns: paste each revised thesis/topic sentence/version into chat so the assistant can give immediate targeted feedback and you can demonstrate stepwise improvement and critical choices.
3. Practice explicit evaluation: when AI suggests changes, state whether you accept or reject them and explain why — this improves critical thinking and documents your learning process.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- Important inconsistency: the “original” essay provided in the JSON is a climate-change draft, while the revised essay (and the chat) concerns migrant workers. Please confirm which essay pair should be assessed in full if you want a comparison of the exact same draft topic. I treated both texts as independent drafts and assessed writing quality accordingly.
- The student successfully integrated the assistant’s structural and lexical guidance into the final draft. For grading or formative feedback, consider awarding participation credit for effective use of AI guidance and encourage the student to show intermediate revisions in chat next time to make the human-AI collaboration more visible and assessable.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

1. My original article is as follows:
In today’s globalized world, more people choose to work abroad for better job opportunities. However, many migrant workers face unfair treatment like long working hours and low pay. I strongly believe governments must create laws to protect their rights in both working time and salary.
Firstly, legal protection can prevent employers from exploiting migrant workers. Without clear rules, some companies force workers to work overtime without extra pay or pay wages below the minimum standard. Laws that set maximum working hours and guarantee fair salaries can stop such abuses. For example, setting a 48-hour weekly limit and requiring overtime pay would ensure workers have time to rest and earn reasonable incomes.
Secondly, protecting migrant workers helps maintain social stability. When workers are treated unfairly, they may feel frustrated and even take extreme actions, which affects local communities. Fair laws make migrant workers feel respected and valued, encouraging them to contribute more to the host country’s economy. This is beneficial for both workers and the society as a whole.
Some may argue that too many laws will increase costs for businesses. But the rights of workers should not be sacrificed for corporate profits. Governments can balance both sides by making reasonable rules that are not too strict for employers but still protect workers.
In conclusion, governments have a responsibility to protect migrant workers through legal measures. Such laws not only safeguard workers’ basic rights but also promote a fairer and more harmonious society. It is a necessary step for the development of both countries and individuals.
2. My revised article is as follows:
In today’s globalized world, more people choose to work abroad for better job opportunities. However, many migrant workers face unfair treatment like long working hours and low pay. Governments must enact and enforce targeted laws to protect migrant workers’ rights—including setting maximum weekly working hours and guaranteeing fair wages—to prevent employer exploitation, foster social stability, and strike a balanced approach between worker protection and business sustainability.
Firstly, legal protection can stop employers from exploiting migrant workers. Without clear rules, some companies force workers to work overtime without extra pay or pay wages below the minimum standard. Laws that limit weekly working hours and require fair compensation for overtime can put an end to such unfair practices. For example, a 48-hour weekly limit with double pay for extra hours would ensure workers have enough rest and earn reasonable incomes.
Secondly, protecting migrant workers is key to maintaining social stability. Migrant workers often make vital contributions to sectors like construction, agriculture, and healthcare in their host countries. When they are denied fair treatment, feelings of injustice can lead to frustration, conflicts, or even protests that disrupt local communities. Fair legal safeguards make migrant workers feel respected and valued, encouraging them to work diligently and integrate better into society—benefiting both the workers and the host country’s economy.
Some may argue that too many laws will increase costs for businesses. But workers’ basic rights should not be sacrificed for corporate profits. Governments can balance both sides by making reasonable rules that are not overly strict for employers but still provide effective protection for migrant workers.
In conclusion, governments have a clear responsibility to protect migrant workers through legal measures. Such laws not only safeguard workers’ fundamental rights but also promote a fairer and more harmonious society. It is a necessary step for the sustainable development of both countries and individuals

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T06:38:16.498Z

*Time:* 2025-11-25T06:40:14.993Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I can work with that. I see your current thesis: “I strongly believe governments must create laws to protect their rights in both working time and salary.”

First, some quick feedback on clarity, strength, and focus:
- Clarity: The main idea is clear (governments should act), but “their rights” is slightly vague — specify whose rights (migrant workers’ rights).
- Strength: “I strongly believe” is personal and weak for an academic thesis. Use a confident, direct verb (e.g., “Governments should enact and enforce…”).
- Focus and preview: The thesis doesn’t preview the main reasons or structure of the essay. A stronger thesis should briefly signal the main points you will discuss (e.g., preventing exploitation, promoting social stability, addressing business concerns).

What to include in your revised thesis (use these as a checklist when you rewrite):
- Identify the actor and the action: governments + clear action (enact/enforce/regulate).
- Specify the protections: working hours and wages (e.g., maximum hours, minimum or fair pay).
- Preview 2–3 main reasons/benefits you will develop in the essay (prevent exploitation; support social stability; balance economic concerns).
- Use confident, precise language and avoid first-person phrases like “I think” or “I strongly believe.”

Helpful verbs and phrases you might use (not a full sentence — use these inside your thesis):
- should enact and enforce
- must guarantee/protect
- by setting maximum working hours and ensuring fair wages
- to prevent exploitation, promote social stability, and balance business interests

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using those points? Write one concise sentence that includes the actor, the action, the protections, and a brief preview of your main reasons. Once you post your revision, I’ll give quick feedback and we’ll move on only when you’re happy with it. Which body paragraph would you like to work on next after that?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T06:40:37.682Z

**You:** the second body garagraph, please

*Time:* 2025-11-25T06:42:10.892Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing the second body paragraph. First, please paste your current thesis statement here (you can copy the sentence from your draft). I’ll give focused feedback on clarity, strength, and focus, and then ask you to try a revision.

Quick guidance to help you rewrite (do not write this as your thesis word-for-word — use it as a checklist):
- Decide a clear stance (agree, disagree, or partly agree) and state it confidently (avoid “I think” or “I strongly believe”).
- Preview the main reasons you will discuss (for example: individuals influence government/policy, individuals influence businesses/consumer demand, but government/corporate action is still crucial).
- Keep it one concise sentence that answers the question and signals the essay’s structure.

When you post your revised thesis, I’ll give brief feedback and we’ll move on only once you’re happy with it. Would you like to try rewriting it now?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T06:42:25.632Z

**You:** OK, please. revise the topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-25T06:43:53.228Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I’m ready to help, but first we need to follow Step 1 of the process: the thesis statement.

1) Please paste your current thesis statement (you can copy the sentence from your original draft).  
If you want, I can use the thesis from your draft:  
"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Quick, focused feedback on that draft thesis:
- Clarity: It answers the question (a partial agreement) but is wordy and repeats ideas (“I partly agree… I believe…”). Be more concise.
- Strength: Avoid first-person phrases (“I believe/I think/I partly agree”) in an academic thesis. State the position directly and confidently.
- Focus & preview: It mentions two ideas (influence on government; personal lifestyle choices), but it doesn’t preview how you will develop them (e.g., how individuals influence policy, how consumer choices affect business, and why government/corporate action remains essential).

Checklist for your revised thesis (use this when you rewrite):
- State your stance clearly (e.g., agree to some extent / partly agree) without “I think.”
- Identify the two main ways you will support that stance (for example: public pressure on government; consumer influence on companies), and briefly acknowledge the limitation (structural change needs large-scale policy/corporate action).
- Keep it one concise sentence, using confident verbs (should, can, play a role, remain essential).

Helpful sentence-building pieces (do not copy as a full sentence — use these fragments inside your own thesis):
- “Individuals can influence policy and market behavior by…”  
- “...but large-scale, systemic change requires government and corporate action.”  
- verbs: should/can/continue to play a role; influence; pressure; signal demand

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Post one concise sentence and I’ll give quick, targeted feedback. We’ll only move on when you’re happy with it.

2) After you confirm the thesis, tell me which body paragraph you want to revise. (Earlier you said the second paragraph — is that still your choice?) Then paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence. I’ll give short feedback on how well it links to the revised thesis and give a clear frame (not a full sentence) you can use to revise the topic sentence. Would you like to proceed with paragraph 2?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T06:44:33.206Z

**You:** Yes, thank you

*Time:* 2025-11-25T06:46:43.568Z

**Assistant:** Great — glad to continue. First, please paste your current thesis statement (you can copy the sentence from your draft). 

Quick reminder of what the revised thesis must do:
- State a clear stance (e.g., partly agree) without first‑person phrases.  
- Name the actor and action (governments should enact/enforce laws to protect migrant workers’ working hours and wages).  
- Preview 2–3 main points you will develop (e.g., prevent exploitation, promote social stability, and balance business concerns).  
- Be one concise, confident sentence.

Useful fragments to include (use them inside your sentence — do not copy a full model sentence from me):
- “Governments should enact and enforce laws that…”
- “by setting maximum working hours and guaranteeing fair wages”
- “to prevent employer exploitation, promote social stability, and balance economic concerns”

Please try rewriting the thesis now (one concise sentence). When you post it, I’ll give quick, focused feedback. Also confirm you still want to work on the second body paragraph after we finish the thesis.
