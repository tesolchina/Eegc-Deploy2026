            ## Contribution Analysis

            Based on the training assessment you provided and the chat history, here is a concise summary and recommendation report tailored to support further student development:

---

### Summary of Human-AI Interaction and Student Revision Work

- The student successfully completed all required revision tasks: thesis statement revision, topic sentence revision, and body paragraph revision.
- The final revised essay demonstrates significant improvement: clearer, more confident thesis; better paragraph organization and transitions; enhanced vocabulary and grammar.
- However, the chat interactions reveal limited active two-way collaboration: the student mainly gave high-level revision commands rather than engaging in detailed iterative refinement of specific sentences.
- The assistant repeatedly requested the exact thesis sentence to facilitate focused feedback, but the student did not paste it, opting instead for broad directives.
- Similarly, no evidence in the chat shows the student exploring alternative phrasings, critically reflecting on AI suggestions, or justifying revisions.
- This pattern suggests a more transactional use of AI (high-level revision commands) rather than dialogic or iterative co-editing that encourages deeper critical thinking and editing skills.

---

### Key Strengths

- The student demonstrates effective final editing and produces a polished essay that addresses the prompt clearly.
- The final essay uses higher-level vocabulary, better grammar, and more coherent organization.
- The student benefits from AI scaffolding but primarily requests broad revisions rather than engaging at the micro-level.

---

### Areas for Growth

1. **Context Provision:**  
   Provide exact thesis, topic sentences, or paragraph drafts when prompted. This allows for targeted, specific suggestions and iterative improvements rather than wholesale rewrites.

2. **Strategic Planning & Iteration:**  
   Follow the recommended stepwise approach (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) engaging deeply with each step before moving on. Experiment with 2–3 alternative phrasings in chat to build choice awareness.

3. **Critical Review of AI Suggestions:**  
   Explicitly comment on AI recommendations by accepting, modifying, or rejecting them with rationales. This will develop higher-order thinking and independent editing judgment.

4. **Use and Integration of Evidence:**  
   Proactively ask AI for specific evidence (studies, data, examples) and critically evaluate such suggestions. Incorporate these to strengthen argumentative credibility.

---

### Recommendations for Future AI-Assisted Revision Sessions

- **Paste the requested exact sentences or excerpts at each stage** and propose 2–3 alternatives if possible. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each choice with the AI.
- **Engage in iterative cycles:** For one paragraph, show at least two rounds of revision in chat with reflective discussion before finalizing.
- **Request and evaluate evidence:** Prompt the AI for concrete examples or statistics to bolster claims and discuss their relevance or validity.
- **Reflect on suggestions:** Whenever the AI offers rephrasings or structural changes, explicitly respond with your preferences or concerns rather than immediately moving on.
- **Balance big-picture and micro-level edits:** While high-level structural edits are important, include sentence-level refinements to improve precision and style.

---

### Instructor Note

The final essay reflects strong editorial improvements and academic voice development. To deepen learning and foster autonomous critical editing skills, require students to document iterative co-editing steps and critical engagement with AI feedback explicitly in chat logs. This will ensure visible evidence of pedagogical progression beyond polished final drafts.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The original essay clearly takes a "partly agree" stance and identifies two relevant points (citizen influence on government; personal lifestyle choices). Ideas are relevant but underdeveloped and repetitive, with limited examples and weak nuance ("But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little...").
- Organization: 20/25 - Basic structure (introduction, two body paragraphs, conclusion) is present, but paragraph development and transitions are sometimes awkward and logic is occasionally unclear.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary is adequate for the topic but simple and repetitive; phrase choices are sometimes imprecise.
- Grammar: 16/25 - Frequent grammatical errors and informal phrasing hinder clarity in places (e.g., "nothing happen", "this is problem", "so is not always working well").
- **Original Essay Total: 74/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 23/25 - The revised essay presents a clearer, more confident position and develops both main points with better examples and nuance (e.g., mentions "public protests, grassroots campaigns, and voting" and discusses limitations). Still could use a specific data point or citation to strengthen claims further.
- Organization: 23/25 - Paragraph topic sentences and transitions are improved; each paragraph focuses on a distinct idea and connects back to the thesis more cleanly.
- Vocabulary: 22/25 - Word choice is more precise and formal (e.g., "policymakers," "systemic policies," "market competitiveness"), with better clause variety.
- Grammar: 22/25 - Sentence structures are more varied and largely accurate; the essay reads fluently with few grammatical lapses.
- **Revised Essay Total: 90/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +16 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis tightened and more academic: revised thesis begins, "I partly agree that individual actions carry less weight..." — clearer stance and preview of two points.
  - Topic sentences and paragraph focus improved: example — "The most important way individuals can combat climate change is by influencing governments and policymakers."
  - Clarity, tone, and grammar improved across the essay; stronger formal vocabulary and better transitions.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Add concrete evidence or data (statistics, cited examples, or a named policy case) to strengthen persuasive force.
  - Develop a brief counterargument/refutation to anticipate objections (e.g., examples of effective individual campaigns vs. policy inertia).
  - Vary paragraph-level sentence structure further and include specific local/regional examples to ground abstract claims.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 18 messages** (assistant prompts and user short commands).
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided detailed, scaffolded guidance and repeated prompts requesting the thesis sentence and iterative revisions. The student repeatedly issued high-level commands ("Revise topic sentences", "Revise one body paragraph", "Revise thesis statement", "Revise the rest of the essay", "Submit the final draft", "Based on the above suggestions, generate a revised article.") but did not paste the specific sentences the assistant asked for in the chat. The revised essay exists as an input, but the chat log shows limited two-way iterative work and little evidence of the student critically engaging with AI suggestions.

Evidence from chat:
- Assistant repeatedly requested: "Please paste your exact thesis sentence you plan to use (copy it from your draft)."
- User responses were mainly directive, e.g., "Revise topic sentences", "Revise one body paragraph", "Revise the rest of the essay" — without pasting candidate lines or evaluating options.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - There are a moderate number of exchanges (18), and the assistant provided in-depth scaffolding. However, the student's questions and responses were brief and directive rather than exploratory; the chat lacks multi-level questions or deep probing from the student.
  - Evidence: Repeated assistant prompts to paste the thesis were not answered with the requested sentence; student issued commands instead of engaging with the scaffold.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - Little evidence that the student critically evaluated AI suggestions or justified acceptances/rejections. The student accepted guidance implicitly by requesting revisions but did not document reasons for choices or ask critical follow-ups.
  - Evidence: No chat lines where the student accepts, modifies, or rejects specific AI proposals with reasons.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - The assistant repeatedly encouraged iterative work (thesis first, then body paragraph), but the chat does not show multiple documented revision cycles with student reflection on changes.
  - Evidence: Multiple assistant checkpoints ("We will not move to Step 2 until you’re satisfied with the thesis."), but the student proceeded with commands rather than documented iterations.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Student produced a clear, substantially improved revised essay with a stronger thesis, clearer topic sentences, and more formal academic tone (evidence: revised thesis sentence and improved paragraph openings).
- The revised essay demonstrates improved grammar and vocabulary and better logical progression.
- The student successfully used AI to generate a polished final draft.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Active engagement in the chat process: the student should paste working thesis/topic sentences and discuss alternatives in chat so the AI can support stepwise improvement.
- Critical evaluation of AI suggestions: the student should explicitly accept, modify, or reject recommendations with reasons to show higher-order editing skills.
- Use of evidence: include specific data, cited examples, or named policy cases to strengthen arguments.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Needs Improvement - The student provided original and revised essays to the assessor but did not supply the requested sentence-level context in chat when prompted repeatedly. Evidence: assistant repeatedly requested the exact thesis and got directive commands instead of the thesis sentence.
- Strategic Planning: Needs Improvement - The student asked for whole-essay revisions but did not participate visibly in the planned stepwise process (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph).
- Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement - No recorded instances of the student questioning or justifying AI suggestions.
- Independent Editing: Developing - The final product shows strong editing, but the chat lacks evidence of independent iterative editing decisions in collaboration with the AI.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. During AI-assisted revision, paste the exact sentence(s) the assistant requests (e.g., thesis, topic sentence) and experiment with 2–3 alternative phrasings; discuss why you prefer one option.
2. Ask the AI for specific evidence suggestions (studies, statistics, policy examples) and then critique the AI’s suggestions before accepting them.
3. Document at least two revision cycles for one paragraph in chat: propose a change, get AI feedback, justify acceptance/rejection, and implement a final version.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student achieved a clear and effective rewrite of the essay, improving clarity, tone, and cohesion. However, the chat log indicates minimal documented collaborative craftsmanship: the student tends to request whole-section revisions rather than engage in micro-level iteration. For pedagogical development, require the student to show one documented revision cycle in chat (thesis revision + student rationale) next time to demonstrate critical use of AI feedback.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
I partly agree that individual actions carry less weight than the efforts of governments and large companies in tackling climate change because citizens can drive impactful policy changes through collective advocacy, while personal green lifestyle choices, though secondary, contribute to broader environmental progress.
The most important way individuals can combat climate change is by influencing governments and policymakers. When citizens unite to demand stricter environmental regulations, governments face greater pressure to act. For example, public protests, grassroots campaigns, and voting for environmentally conscious leaders can push authorities to ban harmful pollutants, invest in renewable energy, or enforce carbon emission reductions. In several countries, collective public pressure has led to new policies on plastic waste management and carbon footprint reduction, demonstrating that ordinary people’s combined voices can shape impactful change—even if individual actions alone seem insignificant. However, this approach is not without limitations: governments may only offer superficial responses rather than decisive action, and some citizens lack clear channels to communicate their demands to policymakers, hindering progress.
On the other hand, individuals can contribute through small but meaningful lifestyle adjustments, such as recycling, conserving water, reducing car use, and choosing eco-friendly products. While these actions are less powerful than systemic policy changes, they play a valuable role. Widespread adoption of green habits sets a social example and signals to businesses that consumers prioritize sustainability, encouraging companies to develop eco-friendly products for market competitiveness. Yet, this approach faces challenges: many people prioritize convenience over environmental responsibility, and limited participation—with only a small fraction of the population adopting green habits—limits its overall impact on climate change.
In conclusion, individual actions alone cannot solve climate change, but they are far from useless. The primary value of individual engagement lies in driving government action through collective advocacy, as systemic policies are the most effective tool for addressing the crisis. Simultaneously, personal green lifestyles contribute to incremental progress by shaping social norms and market demands. Ultimately, a collaborative effort involving governments, companies, and individuals is essential to effectively mitigate climate change and build a sustainable future.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T17:47:57.107Z

**You:** Automation, driven by artificial intelligence and advanced technologies, has sparked a severe job loss crisis worldwide, reshaping the global employment landscape profoundly. This phenomenon is not just a technological shift but a social challenge that demands urgent attention.

The most affected are repetitive and rule-based positions. Tech giants like Microsoft and Google now use AI to generate 30% of their code, slashing demand for junior programmers. In industries ranging from customer service to manufacturing, routine tasks such as data entry, basic testing, and assembly line work are increasingly automated, leading to massive layoffs. Young workers and mid-skill employees are hit hardest, as their newly acquired skills often become obsolete overnight.

While automation eliminates jobs, its impact is not entirely negative. It creates new roles like AI trainers, whose demand has surged by 592% in the US. Moreover, it frees humans from tedious work to focus on creative and empathetic tasks that machines cannot replace, such as caregiving and strategic decision-making.

To mitigate the crisis, joint efforts are needed. Governments should strengthen skill-training programs and improve social security. Enterprises must balance technological progress with employee welfare. Individuals should actively upskill to adapt to the changing job market. Only through such collaboration can we turn the challenge of automation into an opportunity for sustainable employment development.

**Assistant:** Step 1 — Thesis statement

Please paste your current thesis statement here (you can copy the sentence from your draft). I see a draft thesis in your essay, but I want to work from the exact sentence you plan to use.

Quick, specific feedback on the thesis I see in your draft:
- Clarity and focus: Your position is clear you “partly agree,” but the phrasing is wordy and hedged with phrases like “I believe” and “I also think.” Strong academic theses use confident, concise language.
- Answering the question: It does answer the prompt (to what extent you agree), but it could more clearly state the extent of your agreement (e.g., “partly agree” + brief reason).
- Previewing structure: It mentions two reasons (influencing government; personal lifestyle choices) but doesn’t preview how you will develop them (cause/effect, evidence, examples). A stronger thesis briefly signals the two main points and their relative importance.
- Tone and precision: Replace conversational phrases and repetitions (“but at the same time,” “I believe”) with direct academic language.

Revision checklist (use this to rewrite the thesis):
- State your position clearly and confidently (e.g., “I partly agree…” or “I agree to a limited extent…”).
- Give one concise reason why you hold that position (e.g., citizen influence on policy).
- Mention the secondary point and its relative weight (e.g., personal actions are valuable but less impactful).
- Keep it one clear sentence and avoid “I think”/“I believe.”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using that checklist? Paste your revised sentence and I’ll give focused feedback until you’re happy, then we’ll move to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T17:48:21.867Z

**Assistant:** Please paste your current thesis sentence here (you can copy it from your draft). I’ll give quick feedback and then ask you to try a revision.

Helpful feedback about the thesis you have:
- Clarity and focus: Your position (“partly agree”) is clear, but the sentence is wordy and uses hedging phrases like “I believe” and “I also think.” Academic theses should be direct and concise.
- Answering the question: It does answer the prompt (extent of agreement), but it could state the extent more precisely (e.g., “partly agree” + a concise reason).
- Previewing structure: You name two points (influencing government; personal lifestyle choices) but don’t clearly show their relative importance. A stronger thesis signals the two main points and which is more important.
- Tone and precision: Remove conversational phrases and repetition. Use confident language.

Revision checklist to use when you rewrite:
- State your position clearly and confidently (e.g., “I partly agree…” or “I agree to a limited extent…”).
