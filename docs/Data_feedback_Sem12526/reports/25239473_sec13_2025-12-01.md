            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for your engagement so far! Since you chose option B (focus on grammar and word choice) but haven’t yet shared a revised thesis, I’ll propose a clear, corrected thesis sentence based on your original, for you to review and edit if you want:

**Proposed revised thesis:**  
"Industrial automation encourages workers, especially younger ones, to learn high-tech skills like robot design and programming, which improves their employability."

Please let me know:  
- Does this capture what you want to say clearly?  
- Would you like to keep it as is, or make any changes?  

Once we finalize the thesis sentence, we can move on to revising the topic sentence of the paragraph and then the rest of the paragraph for clarity and grammar corrections, step by step.

Feel free to paste your own revision or ask me to suggest one for Step 2 when you’re ready!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The original expresses a clear general idea (automation drives workers to learn tech skills, improving employability) but the claim is underdeveloped and phrased unclearly.
- Organization: 15/25 - Sentences are short and disconnected; the logical progression (cause → effect) is implied but not well signposted.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Some appropriate topic vocabulary appears (programming, robots) but word choice is often inappropriate or nonstandard (e.g., "Automatic industry," "Youngers").
- Grammar: 12/25 - Frequent errors (word choice, articles, plural/singular agreement, stray character 我) significantly reduce clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 60/100**

Evidence (original): "Automatic industry will prompt workers to transform and learn high-tech skills like design robots and我programming.Youngers are willing to embrace the development of technology..." (shows idea but many errors).

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The revised opening sentence is clearer and the main claim about automation encouraging high‑tech skill acquisition is explicit, but development remains general and unsupported.
- Organization: 18/25 - Flow is somewhat improved by combining ideas into clearer sentences, but paragraph transitions and logical links (how skills lead to employment, evidence) are still weak.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Some word-choice improvements (e.g., "Automation encourages workers," "robot design and programming") but persistent nonstandard forms and repetitions remain.
- Grammar: 17/25 - Noticeable improvements in the first sentence, but remaining errors include punctuation/spacing issues, subject/pronoun problems, and agreement errors ("This opportunities", "it can increase the global employment").
- **Revised Essay Total: 73/100**

Evidence (revised): "Automation encourages workers (especially younger workers) to learn high‑tech skills,like robot design and programming, which improves their employability." (improved thesis). Remaining errors: "This opportunities can hone their competitive edge.Those workers’ skills match to industry demand,so industries will hire them and it can increase the global employment."

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +13 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis clarity: The opening sentence was rephrased into a clearer thesis linking automation to skill acquisition and employability.
  - More parallel phrasing: "robot design and programming" corrects earlier nonparallel phrasing.
  - Tone and lexical choice: Replaced nonstandard words ("Youngers") with "younger workers/young people" in the revised draft.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Grammar and agreement: Remaining errors (e.g., "This opportunities", missing spaces after punctuation, awkward clause "it can increase the global employment") should be corrected.
  - Development and evidence: No concrete examples, statistics, or explanation of the mechanism (how training leads to hiring) were added.
  - Cohesion and transitions: Sentences could use clearer linking (e.g., "because / therefore / as a result") to show cause and effect more explicitly.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9** (assistant intro, user essay request, assistant diagnostic, user clarifies topic, assistant clarifies goals, user selects goals, assistant confirms and outlines steps, user chooses option B, assistant gives detailed guidance)
- **Conversation Quality:** Purposeful and task-focused. The assistant provided a structured revision plan and specific correction suggestions. The student clarified the essay topic (automation) and selected revision priorities (clarity of thesis; grammar & word choice), then chose option B (focus on grammar/word choice). The interaction was efficient but relatively short and included limited iteration.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Developing. The exchange is focused and contains clarifying questions and targeted feedback, but it is shorter than the "extensive" benchmark (fewer iterative cycles and follow-up challenges).
  - Evidence: Student clarified "not about climate change, is about automaton" and chose revision priorities; assistant provided multi-step plan and guidance.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - Proficient. The student engaged with the assistant’s suggestions by clarifying the topic and selecting specific goals (choosing B), showing selective acceptance rather than blind acceptance.
  - Evidence: The assistant offered alternatives and the student explicitly selected to focus on grammar and word choice ("Clarity/strength of the thesis / Grammar and word choice" then "B").
- **Refining Process**: 3/5 - Developing. There is evidence of planning and an initial revision decision, but no documented multiple revision cycles in the chat (the revised essay shows some implementation but the chat ends before iterative refinement).
  - Evidence: Assistant outlined Step 1–3; student chose option B and the assistant provided revision frames and asked whether the student wanted to try rewriting; the student did not produce a student-side rewrite in chat.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 10/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear focus and engagement: The student quickly clarified the essay topic (automation) and selected targeted revision goals ("not about climate change, is about automaton"; chose "B").
- Implementation of suggestions: The revised essay shows that the student implemented some AI suggestions (improved thesis sentence structure; corrected "design robots and我programming" → "robot design and programming").
- Task-oriented use of AI: The student used the assistant’s structured approach (thesis/ topic sentence / paragraph) and made choices about which path to follow.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Precise grammar and mechanics: Fix subject-verb agreement, plural/singular mismatches, articles, spacing and punctuation (e.g., "This opportunities" → "These opportunities"; add space after periods/commas).
- Development and evidence: Strengthen arguments with at least one concrete example or brief explanation of how skill acquisition leads to hiring (e.g., training programs, industry demand examples).
- Iteration and critical engagement: Perform at least one or two explicit revision cycles in chat, testing alternate phrasings and requesting explanations for AI suggestions.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Good - The student clarified the topic early ("not about climate change, is about automaton") and chose revision priorities.
- Strategic Planning: Good - The student selected a focused path (B: grammar/word choice) and followed the assistant’s structured steps.
- Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement/Developing - The student accepted recommendations but did not visibly critique alternatives or request deeper justification in the chat.
- Independent Editing: Developing - The student made some edits (seen in the revised essay) but did not demonstrate multiple rounds of independent revision documented in the chat.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Correct remaining grammar and mechanics systematically: run a line-by-line edit for agreement, articles, plural forms, punctuation/spacing. Example fixes: "These opportunities can hone their competitive edge." and "Those workers’ skills match industry demand, so industries may hire them and this could boost global employment."
2. Add one concrete example or brief explanation to develop the paragraph (e.g., a short example of a retraining program or a statistic about job growth in tech fields) to strengthen the causal link.
3. Use the AI iteratively: propose 2–3 alternative thesis/topic-sentence phrasings, ask the assistant to compare them, then choose and refine one. Explicitly test and document each revision in chat.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student completed a measurable revision (thesis clarity improved) but did not complete all three scaffolded tasks requested in the session (topic sentence revision and a full paragraph revision with iteration are not fully documented). Per initial instruction, this means the overall task set is "not finished."
- Encourage the student to continue the iterative process: request the assistant propose corrected full-paragraph versions and then perform one more student-led revision cycle, focusing on grammar, cohesion, and adding at least one specific supporting detail.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:05:25.156Z

**You:** First,help me to revise the statment.Automatic industry will prompt workers to transform and learn high-tech skills like design robots andprogramming.Youngers are willing to embrace the development of technology and willing to learn new and useful skills to equip them.This opportunities can hone their competitive edge.Those workers’ skills match to industry demand,so industries will hire them and it can increase the global employment.

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:09:19.452Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a great place to start. Before I revise anything, let’s agree the goals so our work is focused and useful.

1) Quick question about your priorities
- What do you most want to improve now: clarity/strength of the thesis, aligning the paragraph to the assignment (the climate-change prompt), grammar and word choice, or something else? (Pick up to two.)

2) Brief diagnostic feedback (based on rubric categories)
- Thesis & Argument: The current statement is unclear and doesn’t answer the climate-change prompt you showed earlier. It reads as a claim about automation and employment rather than about individual vs. governmental action on climate.
- Organization: Sentences are short and jumpy; the paragraph needs clearer logical connections.
- Evidence & Development: Claims are general and unsupported; there’s no specific evidence or explanation.
- Language Use: Several grammar and word-choice issues (e.g., “Automatic industry,” “我programming,” “Youngers,” subject-verb agreement, articles). Tone and register need smoothing.

Strengths: You have a clear positive idea (technology helps workers gain skills) and an optimistic claim about employment — that’s a good seed to develop.

3) Decide the immediate target
Please tell me which of these you want to focus on first:
A) Revise the thesis but keep the paragraph topic about automation and employment (fix grammar and clarity).
B) Rewrite the thesis so the paragraph answers the climate-change prompt (individual actions vs governments/corporations).
C) Focus first on grammar/word choice only (no change in topic).

Once you choose (A, B, or C) I’ll move to Step 1 (thesis revision). Would you like to try revising the sentence yourself first, or shall I propose a corrected version for you to edit?

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:09:42.459Z

**You:** not about climate change,is about automaton

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:10:21.653Z

**Assistant:** Great — thank you for clarifying. We’ll treat this essay as being about automation and workers, not climate change.

First, quick check: which up to two goals do you most want to work on now?
- Clarity/strength of the thesis
- Grammar and word choice
- Organization (flow and sentence links)
- Evidence and development (adding reasons/examples)

(Reply with up to two choices.)

Brief diagnostic feedback (short and clear)
- Thesis & Argument: Right now the paragraph makes a general claim about automation helping workers learn tech skills, but the main point is unclear and the sentence is awkward.
- Organization: Sentences are short and disconnected; the paragraph needs clearer links (cause → effect).
- Evidence & Development: Claims are general; no concrete example or explanation of how skills lead to employment.
- Language Use: Several errors (word choice like “Automatic industry,” “Youngers,” stray character “我,” article and agreement problems). The meaning is recoverable but needs smoothing.

Immediate target choice
Given your clarification, these are the practical options:
A) Revise the thesis but keep the paragraph topic about automation and employment (fix clarity and grammar).
B) Keep the thesis idea but focus first on grammar/word-choice across the paragraph (no big change in content).
C) Rework the thesis and also shift the paragraph to add a clearer cause–effect and one specific example (stronger development).

Which do you prefer: A, B, or C?

Next step
Would you like to try rewriting the thesis yourself now, or would you like me to propose a corrected thesis for you to edit? (Either is fine — I’ll support whichever you choose.)

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:10:33.515Z

**You:** Clarity/strength of the thesis
Grammar and word choice

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:10:47.614Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing your targets: clarity/strength of the thesis and grammar & word choice. That helps us focus.

Quick confirm: we’re treating this paragraph as an essay about automation and workers (not the climate-change prompt). Is that correct? (Yes / No)

Brief diagnostic recap (very short)
- Thesis & Argument: The current opening is unclear and doesn’t state a focused claim.
- Organization & Development: Sentences need clearer cause → effect links and at least one specific detail to show how skills lead to employment.
- Language Use: Word-choice and grammar need correction (e.g., “Automatic industry,” “我programming,” “Youngers,” articles, punctuation).

Now please choose one immediate revision path (A, B, or C):
A) Revise the thesis while keeping the paragraph’s topic (automation → employment). We’ll then fix grammar and clarity in the rest.
B) Keep the same thesis idea and first focus only on grammar/word-choice across the whole paragraph (no major content change).
C) Rewrite the thesis and also reshape the paragraph to add a clearer cause–effect and one specific example (stronger development).

Which do you prefer? (A, B, or C)

Also — would you like to:
1) Try writing a revised thesis yourself now (I’ll give feedback), or
2) Have me propose a corrected thesis for you to edit?

Tell me your choices for both questions and we’ll start Step 1.

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:10:59.113Z

**You:** B

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:11:13.497Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing B (focus on grammar and word choice). We’ll still follow the three-step process, starting with the thesis sentence.

1) Quick check: which line is your thesis?
- Do you intend the first sentence — "Automatic industry will prompt workers to transform and learn high-tech skills like design robots and我programming." — to be the thesis? (Yes / No)

2) Brief feedback on that thesis (strength, clarity, focus)
- Main problem: it’s unclear and grammatically awkward. Right now it sounds like a claim about automation and employment, but the wording makes the meaning hard to follow.
- Specific word/phrase problems:
  - "Automatic industry" — awkward phrasing. Consider "industrial automation" or "automation in industry."
  - "will prompt workers to transform" — vague. Do you mean "will require workers to retrain" or "will encourage workers to learn new skills"?
  - "design robots and我programming" — contains a stray character (我). Use parallel noun forms: "robot design and programming" or "designing robots and programming."
  - "Youngers" — not standard; use "young people" or "younger workers."
  - "willing to learn new and useful skills to equip them" — pronoun and phrasing problems. Try "willing to learn new, useful skills to equip themselves."
  - "This opportunities" — grammar: plural mismatch; use "These opportunities."
  - "Those workers’ skills match to industry demand,so industries will hire them and it can increase the global employment." — several issues: use "match industry demand" (no "to"); add spacing after comma; refine "it can increase global employment" to "which could increase employment" or "which may boost employment levels."

3) Quick editing guidance (frames and word choices you can use)
- Thesis frame (fill in your words): [Topic] + [what will happen/why] + [result]. Example frame: "Industrial automation will [require/encourage] workers to [retrain/learn X skills], which will [help them find jobs/increase employment]."
- Short word swaps you can pick:
  - Automatic industry → industrial automation / automation in industry
  - prompt workers to transform → require workers to retrain / encourage workers to learn new skills
  - design robots and programming → robot design and programming / designing robots and programming
  - Youngers → young people / younger workers
  - equip them → equip themselves
  - This opportunities → These opportunities
  - match to industry demand → match industry demand
  - increase the global employment → increase global employment / boost employment levels

4) Now your choice
- Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using those frames/word swaps? (Please paste your version.)
- Or would you like me to propose a suggested corrected thesis for you to edit? (Say "Propose" and I’ll give one concise option.)

Once you share the revised thesis we’ll confirm it and move to Step 2 (topic sentence for the same paragraph).
