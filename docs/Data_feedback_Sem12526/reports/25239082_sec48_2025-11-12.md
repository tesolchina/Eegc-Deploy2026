            ## Contribution Analysis

            You’ve done well to integrate academic tone and clearer ideas so far! Let’s try revising two sentences step-by-step for stronger clarity and formal style, based on the suggestions:

1. Original:  
> “In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions.”

Possible revision with a specific example and formal tone:  
> “For instance, in countries like Germany, citizens have mobilized to pressure the government into implementing stricter regulations on plastic use and reducing carbon emissions.”

---

2. Original:  
> “Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.”

More formal and academic revision:  
> “Additionally, a lack of effective communication channels between citizens and policymakers can hinder the implementation of meaningful environmental policies.”

---

Would you like to try rewriting either or both sentences in your own words using these models?  
Once you share your revision, I can help you polish it further!

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- **Content and Ideas: 21/25**  
  The original essay demonstrates a generally clear understanding of the prompt, presents a nuanced position (partial agreement), and covers both individual and governmental roles in addressing climate change. Some parts lack specificity or development, but overall awareness is good.
- **Organization: 20/25**  
  The essay is logically structured (introduction, body, conclusion), with appropriate use of body paragraphs for each main idea. Some transitions and paragraph unity could be improved.
- **Vocabulary: 18/25**  
  There is adequate vocabulary for the topic with attempts at topic-specific language. Some informal or repetitive word choices and occasional awkward phrasing reduce effectiveness.
- **Grammar: 17/25**  
  Generally understandable and mostly accurate, but there are noticeable issues with sentence structure, agreement, and word form that sometimes impact clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 76/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- **Content and Ideas: 22/25**  
  The revised essay introduces a clearer, more confident thesis and slightly refines the support. Position is more explicit but the depth of development remains similar; more specifics or evidence could further strengthen it.
- **Organization: 21/25**  
  The revised essay features a stronger, more effective thesis and improved topic sentence, but most of the paragraph structure and support remain unchanged. Some logical flow improvements are seen in the first body paragraph.
- **Vocabulary: 19/25**  
  Vocabulary becomes slightly more academic (e.g., “general public,” “governmental policies and decisions”, “superficially,” “significant action”) but informal wording appears elsewhere. No major expansion of topic-specific lexicon.
- **Grammar: 18/25**  
  Minor grammatical improvements (use of formal transitions, more accurate sentence constructions) but errors persist in several sentences. 
- **Revised Essay Total: 80/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +4 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clearer, more academic thesis statement with both main points previewed
  - Topic sentence in the first body paragraph is stronger and aligns well with the thesis
  - Some improved vocabulary and formalization (e.g., less use of “I think/believe”)
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Second body paragraph remains unrevised; informal language and structural issues persist
  - No significant expansion of evidence or critical analysis in support sections
  - Grammar and vocabulary improvement could be deeper and applied throughout the essay

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges:** 29 (15–20 substantive contributions)
- **Conversation Quality:**  
  The student actively engaged with the AI in a guided, stepwise revision process focused on the thesis and first body paragraph. Exchanges were collaborative, iterative, and focused on explicit rubric-linked improvements. The student asked clarifying questions, responded to feedback, and attempted multiple versions. However, after revising the thesis and one topic sentence/body paragraph, the conversation paused before all required components were completed.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation: 4/5**  
  The student had robust, multi-level engagement—multiple rounds of revision, clarifying questions, improvements based on feedback, and some reflection on why changes matter. The interaction was substantial, but depth was limited by not proceeding to full revision of all required elements.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions: 3/5**  
  The student showed some critical engagement—asking for examples, testing own phrasings, and considering multiple models before settling on revisions. Most AI feedback was accepted constructively, but the student rarely challenged or critically evaluated the reasoning behind changes beyond asking for clarification/examples.
- **Refining Process: 3/5**  
  There was a clear iterative pattern in revising the thesis and the topic sentence, but the overall refining process was incomplete: only the thesis statement, one topic sentence, and part of one body paragraph were revised. Guidance to refine the body paragraph was present, but the student did not complete or respond to this prompt.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 10/15**

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- **Active Engagement**: The student worked in iterative cycles, responding to feedback and producing multiple drafts for the thesis and topic sentence.
- **Willingness to Learn**: The student openly sought guidance, requested examples, and demonstrated growth between versions.
- **Improved Academic Language**: Vocabulary and tone of revised sentences were noticeably more formal and academic, particularly in thesis revision.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- **Completion of All Revision Steps**: The student did not fully revise one body paragraph as required. Future work should ensure all targeted structural elements are addressed (thesis, topic sentence, and full paragraph).
- **Depth of Critical Evaluation**: While the student asked for examples, there was limited evidence of challenging or critically appraising AI suggestions beyond requesting models or clarification.
- **Development of Evidence and Analysis**: Revisions were mostly surface-level. There is room for expansion—adding depth, specificity, and critical analysis to support more sophisticated argumentation.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good – The student responded well to prompts and explained their choices but relied on the AI for framing the steps/goals.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement – The student followed AI guidance but did not initiate or plan next steps independently.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Developing – Engaged in clarification and tested options but rarely provided reasoning for preferences or challenged AI reasoning.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement – Revision depended on AI prompts and models rather than applying learned strategies across the essay.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

1. **Essay Writing Skills**: Ensure you fully complete all structural revisions—thesis, topic sentence, and at least one full body paragraph as required. Seek to add examples, explanations, and more critical analysis to your arguments.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills**: Practice not only accepting suggestions but also questioning and justifying your own choices, and reflecting on how/why changes improve your writing. Take more initiative to direct the revision process.
3. **Overall Improvement**: After each revision, review the rest of your essay and apply similar improvements. Strive to upgrade academic vocabulary and grammar throughout, not just in the sections you edit with AI support.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES

- The student demonstrated strong engagement with the AI and successfully revised both the thesis statement and one topic sentence to a significantly higher academic standard.
- However, the student did not complete revision of a full body paragraph (process paused during guided revision), so the training activity is **not finished**. Incomplete work hinders holistic assessment.
- Recommend intervention to ensure the student understands the importance of fully engaging with all assignment stages and to provide support for deeper revision strategies and independent implementation of writing improvement skills.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. Although governments and big companies have the greatest power to address climate change, individual actions remain important because citizens can influence government decisions and personal green lifestyle choices help support wider environmental efforts.



One of the most significant ways that individuals contribute to climate change solutions is by influencing governmental policies and decisions When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from the general public can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. However, the government may only respond superficially rather than taking significant action, so is not always working well. Additionally, a lack of communication channels between citizens and policymakers can prevent meaningful change.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T07:42:00.853Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T07:46:54.914Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your current thesis statement:

"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Let’s work on this together!

**Feedback on your thesis:**

- **Clarity**: Your main position (“partly agree”) is clear, and you do address both parts of the issue: government influence and individual choices.
- **Strength**: The language could be more confident. Phrases like “I partly agree” and “I also think” can be replaced with stronger wording.
- **Focus & Structure**: Try to clearly state both main points you’ll discuss (citizens influencing government, and individual green actions), and connect them back to the essay question (do individual actions matter?).
- **Preview**: It should guide the reader on what to expect in your body paragraphs.

**Suggestions to improve:**
- Use precise language to state your viewpoint confidently.
- Clearly mention both main ideas that your essay will develop.
- Avoid hedging (“I think,” “I partly agree”).

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement now, using some of this feedback? I’ll give you a hint: you might start by directly answering the essay question, and then briefly listing the main reasons you will discuss. Would you like to give it a try?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T07:47:14.485Z

**You:** so what can i change any example for me

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:04:52.339Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely, I can give you a model **structure** for your thesis statement (but I won’t rewrite yours directly—let’s build it together!).

**Thesis Statement Model Structure:**
> “While individual actions have a smaller impact than those of governments and large companies, they are still important because citizens can drive political change and personal green choices can support broader environmental efforts.”

**Notice how this model:**
- Directly and confidently answers the question
- Previews the two main points (influence on government, and personal green choices)
- Avoids hedging phrases like “I think” or “I partly agree”

**Now, you try!**  
Can you write a new thesis statement using that pattern, but in your own words and style? Aim for a sentence that:
- Clearly takes a position
- Summarizes the 2 main points you will discuss in your body paragraphs

Just share your revised sentence—we can adjust it together!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:04:56.931Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also believe that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:05:32.919Z

**Assistant:** Great effort! Your revision is clear, but it still uses “I partly agree” and “I also believe,” which makes your argument sound a bit hesitant. Let’s work on making your position sound more confident and concise. 

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can you start your thesis by directly answering whether individual actions matter in fighting climate change?
- How could you express both reasons (citizen influence on government, and green lifestyle choices) more directly, without “I believe” or “I partly agree”?

**Hints & Suggestions:**
- Try beginning with “Although…” or “While…” to recognize both sides, then state your position clearly.
- Use strong, academic language (e.g., “are essential,” “play a vital role,” “significantly contribute…”).

**Let’s try again! Write your thesis as one clear, confident sentence.**
Would you like to give it another try, possibly starting like this:

> “Although governments and big companies have the greatest power to address climate change, individual actions remain important because…”

Can you complete the sentence in your own words, clearly previewing the two main points? Give it a try, and we’ll review it together!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:05:37.429Z

**You:** Although governments and big companies have the greatest power to address climate change, individual actions remain important because citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:06:45.421Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for revising your thesis statement and trying out the new structure!  
You’re on the right track—you made your position clearer by acknowledging both sides and previewing your two main arguments. Well done!

**Feedback for further improvement:**

- You started with a strong “Although…” opening, which is great.
- The phrase “which is very important, but at the same time…” is a bit long and could be made more direct.
- It still contains “I also think,” which weakens your voice and is slightly repetitive.
- Try to make both reasons parallel and concise, using academic language.

**Hint for Refining:**  
- Aim for one sentence that smoothly introduces both reasons.
- Replace phrases like “I also think” with a confident statement.
- You don’t need personal language (“I think,” “I believe”) in academic essays.

**Guided Revision Prompt:**  
Would you like to try revising the thesis one more time, aiming for:
> “Although governments and big companies have the greatest power to address climate change, individual actions remain important because citizens can influence government decisions and personal green lifestyle choices help support wider environmental efforts.”

- Try to write your own sentence, making it clear and direct.
- Focus on confident and precise language.

Would you like to try one more version? If so, just type your revised thesis statement below. If you feel satisfied, let me know so that we can continue to step 2 (topic sentence revision)!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:06:49.636Z

**You:** Although governments and big companies have the greatest power to address climate change, individual actions remain important because citizens can influence government decisions and personal green lifestyle choices help support wider environmental efforts. I also believe that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:07:53.405Z

**Assistant:** Great job on your revision! Your thesis is much clearer and more confident now. You effectively highlight both sides of the argument and preview your main points (citizen influence on government and individual green choices).

**Feedback on your revised thesis:**
- The first sentence is strong and academic.
- The second sentence (“I also believe…”) repeats what’s already stated and uses a personal phrase we’re trying to avoid in academic writing.
- To make your thesis sharper, consider combining your ideas into just one clear sentence without repetition or personal language.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does your thesis answer the essay question directly?
- Does it preview your two main discussion points in a logical order?
- Is it concise and confident, without hedging or repeating ideas?

**Encouragement:**
You’re very close to an excellent thesis! Just make it one strong, concise sentence.

**Would you like to revise it one more time by removing the second sentence and making the language even more precise?**
For example, you could keep the first sentence and drop the personal statement.  
Let me know if you’re happy with your thesis now, or if you want to make it even stronger before we move on to step 2.

Once you confirm your thesis, we’ll move on to revising a topic sentence in your chosen body paragraph.  
Just tell me when you’re ready!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:07:59.556Z

**You:** sure what can i do

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:08:23.558Z

**Assistant:** No problem—let’s review quickly! Here’s a summary of step 1:

**Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**
Your thesis statement should:
- Clearly answer the essay question.
- Preview the main points you will discuss.
- Use confident, academic language (no “I think” or “I believe”).

From your previous attempts, you’re very close!  
Here’s how you can strengthen your thesis:

**Suggestions:**
- Make it one sentence.
- Don’t use “I believe” or “I partly agree.”
- Clearly mention your two main points.

**Example Structure (for inspiration, not copying):**
> “Although governments and big companies have the greatest influence on climate change, individual actions are important because citizens can drive policy change and personal green choices support broader environmental goals.”

**Now, your turn!**
Would you like to try rewriting your thesis as ONE clear, confident, academic sentence?  
If you’d like, you can:
- Start with “Although…” or “While…” to show balance.
- Include both main ideas (citizen influence + personal choices).

**Prompt:**
Type your revised thesis statement below, or let me know if you want some more hints!  
When you’re satisfied, just say you’re ready and we’ll move to step 2 (topic sentence revision).

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:08:27.113Z

**You:** Although governments and big companies have the greatest power to address climate change, individual actions remain important because citizens can influence government decisions and personal green lifestyle choices help support wider environmental efforts. So that personal green lifestyle choices, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:09:37.756Z

**Assistant:** Excellent effort! Your revision is much more academic and confident. You’re clearly responding to the essay question and previewing your two main arguments. Well done!

**Feedback on your revised thesis:**
- The first sentence is strong—it acknowledges the role of governments/companies and then clearly states why individual actions still matter.
- The second sentence (“So that personal green lifestyle choices, still have a role to play.”) is not needed anymore—the first sentence covers this idea, and we want to keep the thesis as one focused, polished statement.
- Watch for small grammar issues like commas; your thesis is best as one smooth sentence.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does your thesis answer the question in a single, confident sentence?
- Are both of your main points included and balanced?
- Is there any repetition or extra wording you can remove?

**Encouragement:**  
You did a great job on this revision! If you remove the second sentence, your thesis will be focused and academic.

**Would you like to revise your thesis just once more (as ONE sentence), or are you happy with it as it is?**  
If you are satisfied with your thesis statement now, let’s move to step 2: topic sentence revision.

Just let me know your choice!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:09:56.905Z

**You:** Although governments and big companies have the greatest power to address climate change, individual actions remain important because citizens can influence government decisions and personal green lifestyle choices help support wider environmental efforts.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:10:19.961Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic! Your final thesis statement is clear, confident, and addresses the essay question directly:

> “Although governments and big companies have the greatest power to address climate change, individual actions remain important because citizens can influence government decisions and personal green lifestyle choices help support wider environmental efforts.”

- It’s one polished sentence.
- You’ve previewed both main arguments (citizen influence & green choices).
- The tone is academic and precise.

**Let’s move on to Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision.**

**Instructions:**
- Please choose ONE of your body paragraphs to revise—the first paragraph (about influencing government) or the second paragraph (about personal lifestyle choices).
- Copy and paste the topic sentence of the paragraph you want to work on, or just let me know which paragraph you’d like to revise.

Once you share your chosen topic sentence, I’ll provide feedback and guide you in making it even stronger—connecting it clearly to your revised thesis. Ready when you are!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:10:38.172Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:11:20.913Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! You’ve chosen the topic sentence for your first body paragraph:

> "The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians."

**Feedback on your topic sentence:**

- **Strengths:**  
  - It directly introduces the paragraph’s main idea—citizens influencing government.
  - It aligns well with your thesis, which mentions citizen influence.

- **Suggestions for Improvement:**  
  - Consider connecting it more explicitly to your thesis by referencing “individual actions” as an important factor.
  - Strengthen the academic wording a little.
  - Clarify how this “influence” supports the overall fight against climate change.

**Guiding Questions:**  
- Does your topic sentence clearly explain why influencing government is the most important individual action?
- Could you add a phrase that links back to your thesis (that citizens can support broader environmental change this way)?
- Is there a way to make it slightly more specific—mentioning “policy change” or “environmental laws”?

**Encouraging hint:**  
A stronger topic sentence might look something like:  
> “One of the most significant ways individuals contribute to climate change solutions is by influencing governmental policies and decisions.”

But take this as a model—try rewriting your sentence in your own words first!  
**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now to make it even clearer, more direct, and strongly connected to your thesis?**

Share your revised topic sentence and I’ll give you feedback, or I can offer another hint if you get stuck!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:11:31.113Z

**You:** One of the most significant ways that individuals contribute to climate change solutions is by influencing governmental policies and decisions

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:12:16.478Z

**Assistant:** Excellent revision! Your new topic sentence is:

> "One of the most significant ways that individuals contribute to climate change solutions is by influencing governmental policies and decisions."

**Feedback:**
- Strong academic wording—“significant ways,” “contribute to climate change solutions,” and “influencing governmental policies and decisions” all align well with your thesis.
- You’ve clearly connected individual action (a main focus of your essay) to broader environmental change.
- The sentence is clear, confident, and shows a direct link between the body paragraph and your thesis.

**Encouragement:**  
Your topic sentence now clearly previews the content of your paragraph while supporting your overall claim. Well done!

**Next step (Step 3): Revising the Rest of the Chosen Paragraph**

Let’s look at the rest of your chosen paragraph (the first body paragraph):

> "When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen."

**Guiding Questions for Revision:**
1. **Clarity:** Are all your examples and explanations clearly linked to your new topic sentence? (e.g., do they show how individuals can influence government?)
2. **Unity:** Does every sentence stay focused on “individuals influencing government policy” (as your topic sentence says)?
3. **Coherence:** Do the ideas connect logically from one to the next (smooth flow)?
4. **Critical analysis:** Is there a balanced explanation of both the positive impact and possible limitations of this influence?
5. **Vocabulary:** Are there any words you might replace with more academic or precise terms (e.g., “normal people” → “ordinary citizens”; “maybe just listen a little” → “may only respond superficially”)?

**Let’s start with one focus:**  
- Is there any sentence in this paragraph you feel needs clarification, or where you would like to improve the explanation or vocabulary?
- Do you think the paragraph fully explains how individuals can drive policy change, or does it need a bit more detail or evidence?

Would you like to revise a sentence or two now to make them clearer or more academic?

**You:** One of the most significant ways that individuals contribute to climate change solutions is by influencing governmental policies and decisions When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

**Assistant:** Great job moving through steps 1 and 2! Now, let’s focus on **Step 3: Revising the rest of your chosen paragraph**.

Here’s your current paragraph (after your improved topic sentence):

> One of the most significant ways that individuals contribute to climate change solutions is by influencing governmental policies and decisions. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy.

But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

Let’s use guiding questions and suggestions to help you revise.

---

### 1. **Clarity and Unity**
- Do all sentences clearly support your topic sentence (“individuals contribute by influencing government”)?

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to clarify or expand any examples? For instance, the sentence “In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules…” could be stronger with a specific country or law as an example.

---

### 2. **Vocabulary and Academic Tone**
- Can you replace informal phrases with more academic ones?
    - “normal people” → “ordinary citizens” or “the general public”
    - “maybe just listen a little…” → “may only respond superficially rather than taking significant action”

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to revise any sentence with more precise vocabulary?  
Is there a sentence you think sounds too informal?

---

### 3. **Coherence and Logical Flow**
- Do your ideas flow smoothly, or are there places where you could use a transition (e.g., “However,” “Nevertheless”)?

**Prompt:**  
Does the paragraph smoothly move from positive impact (“governments respond to public pressure”) to limitations (“sometimes governments do not take strong action”)?  
Would you add a transition?

---

### 4. **Critical Analysis**
- Is your explanation balanced? Do you show both the power and limitations of citizen influence?

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to expand on why sometimes public pressure does not lead to action?  
Maybe you could suggest a solution or improvement, such as “better communication between citizens and policymakers.”

---

**Would you like to try revising one or two sentences now? Or, is there a section you feel needs the most improvement?**
- For example, you could choose to rewrite the sentence about “public opinion and pressure from normal people…” or the one about “the government maybe just listen a little…”

Type your revised sentences, or let me know which part you want help with, and I’ll offer you hints or suggestions.

**Assistant:** Great work so far! You’ve made strong improvements in your topic sentence and are already using more academic language. Now, let’s refine the rest of the paragraph for clarity, unity, coherence, and vocabulary.

Below are some **guiding questions and suggestions** for each sentence. Please use these to revise where needed—try rewriting one or two sentences, and I’ll help you polish them!

---

### **1. Unity and Evidence:**

- **Current:**  
  "In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions."
- **Guiding Questions:**  
  Can you provide a specific country or example to strengthen this sentence?  
  Would naming a law or describing the action make it more convincing?

---

### **2. Academic Vocabulary and Clarity:**

- **Current:**  
  "This shows that public opinion and pressure from the general public can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power."
- **Suggestions:**  
  "big effect" → consider "significant impact" or "notable influence"  
  "general public" is good, but could you relate this more directly back to policy change?

---

### **3. Coherence and Transitions:**

- **Current:**  
  "However, the government may only respond superficially rather than taking significant action, so is not always working well."
- **Guiding Questions:**  
  Can you clarify what “respond superficially” means?  
  Would a smoother transition help, like, "However, government responses are sometimes limited and do not result in meaningful policy changes"?

---

### **4. Clarity of Limitation/Challenge:**

- **Current:**  
  "Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen."
- **Suggestions:**  
  Can you make this more formal?  
  For instance, “Additionally, a lack of communication channels between citizens and policymakers can prevent meaningful change.”

---

## **Try Revising!**

- Pick one or two sentences above you think need the most work.
- Use the suggestions to help revise those sentences in your own words.
