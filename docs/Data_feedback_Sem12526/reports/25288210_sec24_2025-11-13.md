            ## Contribution Analysis

            It looks like you identified the thesis statement correctly and received clear, specific feedback on how to strengthen it, but you did not proceed to revise the statement or engage further with the AI suggestions. To move forward effectively, I recommend these steps:

1. **Try Revising Your Thesis Statement:**  
   Using the feedback, write a clearer and more confident thesis such as:  
   *“I agree that governments and big companies have the greatest responsibility for addressing climate change, but individuals also play an important role by influencing government policies and adopting greener personal habits.”*  
   This version clearly previews your two main points and expresses your position confidently.

2. **Engage Actively with AI Feedback:**  
   Ask for examples, clarification, or help with any part you find difficult. Don’t hesitate to explain your reasons or ask how to make the language stronger.

3. **Continue the Revision Process:**  
   After revising the thesis, proceed to revising topic sentences and body paragraphs, focusing on improving grammar and vocabulary as suggested.

If you want, I can help you draft the next revision or walk you through the steps again. Would you like me to provide a sample improved thesis statement or assist with revising a paragraph?

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing Skills**: Actively implement AI suggestions in the draft (revise the thesis, experiment with language, address feedback on grammar and content).
2. **AI Collaboration Skills**: Engage in an ongoing dialogue—ask for examples/models, clarify confusing feedback, and critically reflect on recommendations to make the most of AI support.
3. **Overall Improvement**: Complete all required revision steps—thesis, topic sentence, and body paragraph revisions—before re-submission to maximize learning and skill development.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
The student has not completed the key training steps (thesis revision, topic sentence revision, body paragraph revision). Encourage the student to treat the AI as a collaborative partner and to practice the full revision process. Consider holding a short conference to model AI-assisted revision and discuss the value of iterative feedback.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-13T03:10:38.161Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T03:23:58.306Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s begin with Step 1: Revising the thesis statement.

Here’s your current thesis statement:
> I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

**Feedback:**
- **Clarity:** Your meaning is clear, but the sentence is a bit long and complicated. The ideas could be grouped more tightly.
- **Strength:** The phrase “I partly agree” is good for showing a balanced viewpoint, but your language (“I believe… I also think…”) could be more confident. Try to avoid “I think” or “I believe” in the final draft.
- **Focus:** It would help to preview the two main points of your essay: (1) citizens influencing governments, and (2) the effect of individual green choices. 

**Revision Guidance:**
- State your position confidently.
- Combine your two reasons in a way that previews your essay’s structure.

Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now, using these suggestions? (I’m here if you’d like more help or examples!)
