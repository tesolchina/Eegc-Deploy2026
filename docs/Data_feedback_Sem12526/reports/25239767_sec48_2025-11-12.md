---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing Skills**: Revisit complete body paragraphs for content development and clarity; work on integrating feedback at all text levels (not just topic sentences).
2. **AI Collaboration Skills**: Engage more deeply with AI advice—ask clarifying questions, challenge guidance, and justify your choices. Use AI for paragraph and whole-essay revision, not only for isolated sentences.
3. **Overall Improvement**: Embrace the full revision cycle: draft, review, revise, refine. View suggestions as prompts for critical thinking, not just corrections to accept or copy.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- Student needs close guidance to complete the revision cycle. Recommend scaffolding revisions with explicit instructions to finish all required steps and reflect on changes.
- Stronger modelling of critical engagement and justification of choices is needed.
- Next interventions should require visible completion of each revision phase before progressing.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I strongly agree with this idea because I believe that citizens can highly influence the government, which is very important. However, at the same time, I also believe that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians, as government can encourage widespread participation to release  more powerful energy. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also mobilize collections with small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive to improve the environment.
These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T07:42:18.286Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T07:46:58.741Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s begin with **Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**.

You’ve shared your current thesis statement:

> "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

**Let’s review it together:**

**Clarity:** Your thesis expresses a clear position: you "partly agree," and you specify two main ideas—citizens influencing the government, and personal green choices.

**Strength and Focus:** It has good structure, but the wording could be more direct and confident. Phrases like "I partly agree" and "I also think" may sound less assertive. Instead, try stating your viewpoint firmly.

**Preview of main points:** You mention both influencing government and personal choices, which previews the essay structure well.

**Suggestions for improvement:**
- State your position confidently and clearly.
- Preview the order/main points (government influence and personal action).
- Avoid hedging language like "I partly agree" and "I think."

**Questions to consider:**
- Does your thesis answer the essay question directly?
- Does it show your viewpoint strongly?

**Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now based on this feedback?** If you want, I can give a short example, but I’ll wait for your attempt first!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T07:47:17.912Z

**You:** I strongly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can highly influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also believe that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T07:59:58.217Z

**Assistant:** Great job trying to make your thesis more assertive! Let’s review your revised version:

> "I strongly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can highly influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also believe that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

**Strengths:**
- Your position ("strongly agree") is now stated more confidently.
- You identify your two points—government influence and green lifestyle choices.
- The sentence structure is improved.

**Suggestions for further improvement:**
- The thesis is still a bit long and could be clearer if separated or organized more simply.
- Phrases like "I strongly agree with this idea" could be specified: what exactly are you agreeing with? Name the issue directly, e.g., "individual actions do not matter as much as government or corporate action..."
- Try to limit unnecessary words like "I believe" and "I also believe" for more precision.  
- Consider the order: usually, put your strongest point first.

**Guiding questions:**
- Can you make your thesis even more concise?
- Can you name the main issue/question in your thesis, so it is clear—even if someone hasn’t read the prompt?

**Would you like to try revising it one more time, using these tips for clarity and directness?**  
If you wish, I can provide a model afterward!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:00:05.760Z

**You:** Go to the nest step

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:02:57.636Z

**Assistant:** Well done for revising your thesis, and thank you for your effort so far! Before moving to Step 2, please confirm you are happy with your latest thesis statement, or if you’d like, you can share your final version now for a quick final check.

**Next is Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision.**

**Instructions:**

1. Please choose one body paragraph you would like to improve.
   - You can select either the paragraph about influencing government, or the one about individual green choices.
2. Copy and paste the topic sentence for that paragraph here.

Once you share your topic sentence, I’ll review how well it supports your new thesis, give you feedback, and help you revise it before we move on to the rest of the paragraph.

**Which body paragraph would you like to work on? And can you share its topic sentence?**

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:03:02.096Z

**You:** Go to the next step

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:03:51.373Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s move on to **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**.

You need to:
1. Choose one body paragraph you want to improve (either the one about influencing the government, or the one about personal green lifestyle choices).
2. Share the topic sentence from that paragraph here.

**Please copy and paste the topic sentence you’d like to revise. I’ll provide feedback to make sure it clearly supports your updated thesis, and help you make it even stronger!**

So:  
- **Which paragraph would you like to work on?**  
- **What’s the topic sentence from that paragraph?**

Looking forward to your answer!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:03:54.837Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:05:01.992Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your chosen topic sentence:

> "The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians."

**Let’s review it:**

**Strengths:**
- Clearly states the main idea of your paragraph: individual influence on government action.
- Directly relates to your thesis, especially if your thesis puts government influence as the stronger point.

**Suggestions for improvement:**
- You might make the connection to your thesis even clearer, especially by clarifying why influencing government is more significant than other actions.
- Consider emphasizing the impact or necessity of this approach, to show why it is the "most important."
- You could also mention how this method compares to other forms of individual action (personal habits), in order to reinforce your essay’s stance.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does your topic sentence make it obvious why influencing government is "the most important" way?
- Can you clarify the effect individuals can have when acting together in this role?

**Would you like to try revising this topic sentence now to make the connection and emphasis even clearer?**  
If you prefer, I can offer a short example after your attempt!

Let me know when you’re ready with your revised topic sentence.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:05:05.392Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians, as government can act as a bridge to call more people to fight for the climate change together, releasing more powerful energy.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:09:35.770Z

**Assistant:** Great revision attempt! Let’s look at your new topic sentence:

> "The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians, as government can act as a bridge to call more people to fight for the climate change together, releasing more powerful energy."

**Strengths:**
- You explain why influencing government is important: it brings more people together and increases overall impact.
- There is a clear link to your thesis—the focus is on government influence as the most powerful method.

**Suggestions for further improvement:**
- The phrase "releasing more powerful energy" could be clearer—do you mean "creating greater impact" or "leading to stronger collective action"?
- Try to keep your wording precise and academic. For example, "act as a bridge to call more people" could be, "mobilize collective action" or "encourage widespread participation."
- Consider tightening the sentence for clarity and flow.

**Guiding questions for your next revision:**
- Is there a way to say that government action can mobilize or unite people for bigger change?
- Can you state more directly why influencing government has a bigger effect than personal actions?

**Would you like to revise your topic sentence again using these suggestions?**  
Try to focus on clarity and strong academic language!

Once you’re happy with your topic sentence, let me know, and we can move to revising the rest of the paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:09:51.507Z

**You:** On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:11:41.468Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing the topic sentence from your second body paragraph:

> "On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive."

**Review:**

**Strengths:**
- The topic sentence introduces the focus of this paragraph: individual lifestyle actions for the environment.
- It signals a contrast with your previous point (“On the other hand...”), which helps show the structure of your argument.

**Suggestions:**
- The sentence could more clearly link to your thesis by emphasizing that, while less impactful than influencing government, these actions still contribute to addressing climate change.
- Consider stating why you are discussing these actions—are they meaningful despite being less significant? What is their role, according to your essay stance?
- The phrase “can also make small changes” could be more precise and academic.

**Guiding questions for your own revision:**
- Does your topic sentence show that personal actions are less impactful but still play a role? (This matches your thesis.)
- Can you use more precise language to show the relationship between personal actions and larger change?
- Would it help to use a transitional phrase or make the contrast even clearer?

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now, using these tips?**  
When you’re ready, share your improved sentence here, and I’ll give you quick feedback before you revise the rest of the paragraph!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:11:56.855Z

**You:** On the other hand, individuals can also mobilize collections with small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive to improve the environment.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:14:03.519Z

**Assistant:** Nice work revising your topic sentence! Let’s review your update:

> "On the other hand, individuals can also mobilize collections with small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive to improve the environment."

**Strengths:**
- You’re introducing the contrast to the previous paragraph clearly (“On the other hand...”).
- You mention specific personal actions as examples.
- You try to show that individual efforts can add up collectively.

**Suggestions:**
- The phrase “mobilize collections” is not clear in academic English—did you mean that people’s actions can build up or add together? Consider a more precise phrase, such as “create collective impact” or “contribute to overall environmental improvement.”
- To align closely with your thesis, you could highlight that while these actions may seem small or less significant than influencing government, they still have a meaningful supporting role.

**Questions to guide your next revision:**
- Can you clarify what you mean by “mobilize collections”?
- Does your topic sentence clearly show that individual actions, while smaller in scale, still help the environment?

**Would you like to revise your topic sentence using these suggestions?** Try to focus on clarity and directly linking to your thesis (individual small actions support climate action, though not as powerfully as influencing government).

Once you’re satisfied with your topic sentence, let me know, and we’ll move to revising the rest of the paragraph for clarity and unity!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:14:15.606Z

**You:** Go to the next step

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:14:57.655Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! Now that you’ve worked hard on improving your topic sentence, let’s continue with **Step 3: Revising the Rest of the Chosen Paragraph**.

### Here’s what to do:

Please copy and paste the full paragraph (not just the topic sentence) that you want to revise, or let me know if you need me to repost it for you.

As you review, think about:
- Do all the supporting sentences clearly connect to your new topic sentence?
- Are your ideas organized logically and explained clearly?
- Is there any evidence that needs to be clearer or more detailed?
- Does the paragraph stay focused, or are there off-topic ideas?
- Are there areas where you can use more precise academic vocabulary?

**Guiding questions for your revision:**
1. Do each of your examples and explanations show how small individual actions add up—without overstating their impact?
2. Is there anything unclear or repetitive?
3. Could you include a brief explanation of *why* personal actions still matter, even if they are not as significant as influencing government?

Would you like to try revising the rest of the paragraph yourself now?
- If you want, you can post your revised version for feedback.
- Or, if you prefer, I can point out specific sentences that could be improved.

**Let me know your choice! If you post a revised paragraph, I’ll give detailed, encouraging feedback (but remember, I won’t rewrite it for you!).**

Ready when you are!
