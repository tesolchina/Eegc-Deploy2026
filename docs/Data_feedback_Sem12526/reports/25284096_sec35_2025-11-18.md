Automation is making dramatic changes to industries, making them transform. In my opinion, this technological shift will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.
Admittedly, the fact recently is that automation has replaced a lot of jobs, leading to the flood of unemployment. Someone may complain about AI automation and think its effects in industries will undermine global employment prospects forever.
However, I think this shift has more benefits to global employment prospects in the long term because lots of new jobs related to AI automation will appeared as AI automation developed.
Moreover, most of the jobs AI automation replaced are simply and repetitive work, so the demands for works that need high-level of thinking skills to service skills will increase, adding more job opportunities to the market.The shift of the demand will encourage more young people to practice high-level skills, improving their ability.At the same time, efficiency is boosted by automation, increasing productivity and the level of everyone's life in the society ,making those unemployed happier.
In conclusion, the technological shift due to automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term. Human should embrace this shift and hold a positive attitude towards it.

## STEP 3: BODY PARAGRAPH REVISION

Let’s focus on revising the supporting sentences in your chosen paragraph (the one beginning with your new topic sentence).

Here’s your *original paragraph* for reference:

> However, I think this shift has more benefits to global employment prospects in the long term because lots of new jobs related to AI automation will appeared as AI automation developed.
> Moreover, most of the jobs AI automation replaced are simply and repetitive work, so the demands for works that need high-level of thinking skills to service skills will increase, adding more job opportunities to the market.The shift of the demand will encourage more young people to practice high-level skills, improving their ability.At the same time, efficiency is boosted by automation, increasing productivity and the level of everyone's life in the society ,making those unemployed happier.

**Let’s improve clarity, unity, and coherence, focusing on your selected targets (argument strength, clarity, structure, vocabulary, and grammar).**

**Guiding questions:**
- Do all supporting details directly relate to your revised topic sentence?
- Are your examples and explanations clear and specific?
- Is the paragraph logically developed?
- Are there any grammar or vocabulary errors to address?

**Suggested approach:**
1. Start by revising your first supporting sentence—does it clearly expand on your topic sentence?
