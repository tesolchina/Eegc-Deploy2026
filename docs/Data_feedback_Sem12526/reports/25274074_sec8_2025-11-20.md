            ## Contribution Analysis

            It looks like you’ve made a good start engaging with the essay revision process, working on your thesis and topic sentences with AI support. Here’s a concise summary of suggestions and next steps, based on your draft and our interaction so far, to help you continue improving your essay writing and revision skills:

---

**Key Suggestions for Your Essay:**

1. **Thesis Statement:**  
   - Make it direct and confident without phrases like “this paper thinks.”  
   - Clearly state *why* governments should enforce stricter laws, previewing your main reasons.  
   - Example:  
     > Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers because regulation can prevent unemployment, reduce social problems caused by illegal migration, and improve education and integration.

2. **Topic Sentences and Paragraph Focus:**  
   - Start each paragraph with a sentence that clearly states the *main point* connected to your thesis.  
   - For example, for the paragraph on controlling worker numbers:  
     > To prevent unemployment and maintain a balanced labor market, governments should strictly regulate the number of migrant workers.

3. **Developing Paragraphs:**  
   - Explain *how* and *why* your points matter. If you say, “regulate the number,” explain that too many low-wage workers can oversupply the job market and cause unemployment for both migrants and locals.  
   - Use specific examples or logical explanations to support your claims.

4. **Improve Vocabulary and Grammar:**  
   - Replace awkward phrases and incorrect words:  
     - “economical level” → “economic level”  
     - “create more price” → “increase production” or “create more value”  
     - “low-price workers” → “low-wage workers”  
   - Check for subject-verb agreement, consistent verb tense, and sentence completeness.

5. **Style and Tone:**  
   - Avoid informal or conversational openings like “Yes, of course!”  
   - Use an academic tone: objective, clear, and professional.

---

**Practical Next Steps:**  
- Choose one paragraph you want to revise next (e.g., about controlling the number of migrant workers).  
- Write a clear topic sentence linked to your thesis.  
- Add 2-3 sentences that explain and support the topic sentence, using clear language and examples.  
- Share your draft sentences here, and I can help you polish them step by step.

---

**How to Write Better in General:**  
- Practice breaking your ideas into short, clear sentences.  
- Focus on one idea per paragraph.  
- Use transition words to connect ideas logically (first, moreover, therefore).  
- Read your writing aloud to catch awkward phrasing or errors.  
- Revise multiple times, making your sentences more precise and your argument clearer with each round.

---

If you want, we can work now on revising your topic sentence and one or two supporting sentences from your paragraph together. Or you can share another sentence or paragraph you’d like to improve. Just let me know how you’d like to proceed!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: **16/25** – The essay addresses the topic (stricter laws for migrant workers) and presents several relevant points, but core ideas are often unclear, repetitive, and lack depth.
- Organization: **15/25** – Attempted structure via listing, but there is significant repetition, unclear progression, and weak topic sentences; paragraph focus is lacking.
- Vocabulary: **14/25** – Limited range; multiple inaccurate word choices ("create more price," "economical level," "low-price workers"); significant awkwardness and errors.
- Grammar: **14/25** – Frequent grammar errors (tense agreement, sentence fragments, confusing constructions) that impede clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 59/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: **18/25** – Slight improvement in the thesis clarity and attempted integration of reasons in initial paragraphs, but the essay remains underdeveloped, and most revisions are superficial.
- Organization: **17/25** – Minor improvements: clearer thesis in opening, and a model topic sentence added, but most paragraphs are unchanged and the overall flow is still weak.
- Vocabulary: **16/25** – Marginal improvement: use of “regulation,” “integration,” “unemployment,” and “labor market” in model statements, but original vocabulary remains largely intact elsewhere.
- Grammar: **15/25** – Some revised sentences show improvement, but most of the essay retains original errors; only partial correction.
- **Revised Essay Total: 66/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +7 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Slightly clearer thesis statement inserted (via AI guidance, e.g., “Governments should enforce stricter laws…”).
  - A revised topic sentence for one body paragraph is partially incorporated.
  - Attempts to restate some points using model language.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Body paragraph revision is incomplete; only partial AI-suggested sentences used, and full paragraph remains largely unchanged.
  - Most of the essay retains grammatical, organizational, and vocabulary issues; editorial corrections are not consistently applied.
  - Paragraph development (explanation, examples) is minimal; opportunity for deeper reasoning is missed.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 13**
- **Conversation Quality:** The chat shows initial goal setting and diagnostic feedback from the AI, with the student responding mostly via short requests (“Revise thesis statement,” “Revise topic sentences”). The AI provided detailed guidance, examples, and step-by-step scaffolding. The student requested model answers and advice ("ask an example”, “how can i write better”), but there is little evidence of deeper dialogue or substantial iterative revision.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: **3/5** – There are multiple exchanges (13), and the AI offers detailed advice, but the student’s engagement is somewhat surface-level: mostly prompting the assistant to do steps, requesting examples, and not developing answers or asking complex follow-up questions.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: **2/5** – The student largely accepts AI suggestions; there’s little questioning or critique. Some minimal effort to use or request examples, but no visible acceptance/rejection rationale or evidence-based evaluation.
- **Refining Process**: **2/5** – There’s an attempt to revise thesis and topic sentence, but the process is not iterative; the student does not provide draft responses or work through multiple versions, and body paragraph revision is incomplete.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Willingness to seek help and request examples (“ask an example,” “do you have some suggestions…”).
- Some understanding of the revision structure (asking for thesis and paragraph revision).
- Reception to constructive feedback (seeking suggestions for improvement).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- *Revision Depth*: The student needs to engage more actively—by producing and refining draft sentences and paragraphs, not just accepting model examples or minimal changes.
- *Critical Engagement*: More evidence-based questioning of AI suggestions and justification for their use is needed.
- *Organizational Skills*: Paragraph focus, logical flow, and supporting explanation should be improved by utilizing the revision cycle more thoroughly.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement – Student does not provide explicit essay goals or context beyond basic responses, and often relies on AI to set direction.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement – The approach is reactive; the student prompts the AI for next steps rather than strategizing independently.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement – No visible critical analysis of AI suggestions, and minimal justification for acceptance or editing choices.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement – Student relies heavily on AI-suggested examples and does not attempt independent sentence/paragraph drafting.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing Skills**: Practice generating and revising your own thesis statements, topic sentences, and paragraphs using guided structures. Apply feedback points by rewriting—not copying—model sentences.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills**: Engage in iterative dialogue: ask clarifying questions, try drafting your own sentences, evaluate and adapt AI feedback, and explain *why* or *why not* you accept revisions.
3. **Overall Improvement**: Focus on deeper revision practice by working through multiple drafts, expanding body paragraph explanations, and striving for more accurate grammar and vocabulary.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student completed partial steps (thesis and topic sentence revision) but did not fully revise a body paragraph as required; opportunity for practice is not maximized.
- Future sessions should encourage the student to produce independent writing and openly reflect on choices—rather than relying on model answers—while using the AI for guidance and not as the sole reviser.
- Consider scaffolding more structured paragraph revision, and require the student to submit both their drafts and a rationale for revisions.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Yes, of course! As we all know, courtiers have a lot of migrant workers, it refers to they have higher economical level all over the world. So they need more labors to create more price. In the other hand, thinks a country has higher economical level it explains it may have low born rate, so they have not more native-born population. All in all, they actually need more migrant workers from other countries so they must enforce stricter law to safeguard their rights, and you will get more workers. So, this paper thinks governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights. But there are some points that governments should notice. First of all , the governments should c control the number of migrant workers. In other words, the governments should notice demand and supply because if more and more low-price workers happen in the market, it will result in supply over the demand and the unemployment -rate will become higher because there will be more and more workers in the market. Secondly , the governments should strengthen the management of the illegal migrant workers. For example, if there are too much illegal workers, there will be more society problems and it is unfair for those legal workers . What's more, the governments should strengthen the education of the migrant workers included the local laws. the culture and so o.....It will decline the problems between local and migrant workers. In the end of this paper, this paper think the government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard the migrants workers' right for their long hours and unfair pay's problem.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-20T05:49:47.815Z

**You:** Revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-20T05:51:03.627Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s begin by setting clear learning goals and diagnosing your essay, then we’ll work together to revise your thesis statement.

**Preliminary Stage — Negotiating Targets and Diagnosing the Essay**

**1. Negotiating Targets**
Before we start, could you tell me which areas you’d most like to improve in your essay? For example:
- Clarity and focus of ideas
- Strength of argument
- Logical organization/structure
- Grammar and word choice
- Style and academic tone

Is there one or two you’d like to focus on most today? (Let me know!)

**2. Diagnostic Feedback**
Here’s a quick diagnosis of your current draft using standard essay rubric categories:

- **Thesis & Argument:** Your thesis is present (about governments enforcing stricter laws to protect migrant workers), but it’s not very clear, confident, or specific. It could be more direct and clearly preview the essay’s key points.
- **Organization:** There’s an attempt at structure (listing points), but ideas sometimes repeat and connections between ideas can be unclear.
- **Evidence & Development:** Some reasons are given, but they could be more deeply explained with examples, and each paragraph should focus on one main idea.
- **Language Use:** Some sentences are hard to follow, with grammatical errors and awkward phrasing (“create more price,” “higher economical level”). Some word choices are inaccurate.

**Strengths:** You are tackling a clear social topic and making recommendations. Your ideas focus on government responsibility.

**Areas for Improvement:** Clarity, thesis statement focus, paragraph structure, and grammar.

**3. Student Priority Selection**
Which of the above do you want to prioritize during revision? For example, would you like to start with making your thesis statement clearer and stronger? Or does organization or grammar seem more important for you right now?

**(Please reply with your chosen focus. After your input, we’ll begin Step 1!)**

---

**If you’d like to proceed straight to thesis revision, here’s your thesis from the current draft:**

> “So, this paper thinks governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights. But there are some points that governments should notice…”

**How confident do you feel about this thesis statement? Is your main goal to make it:**
- Clearer?
- More confident?
- More specific?
- All of these?

**Let me know, and I’ll help you revise it!**

---

**Once you reply, we’ll move on to refining your thesis statement step-by-step.**

*Time:* 2025-11-20T05:51:08.910Z

**You:** Yes, of course! As we all know, courtiers have a lot of migrant workers, it refers to they have higher economical level all over the world. So they need more labors to create more price. In the other hand, thinks a country has higher economical level it explains it may have low born rate, so they have not more native-born population.     Revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-20T05:51:56.479Z

**Assistant:** Thank you! We’ll focus on revising your thesis statement first, as this will help make your whole essay clearer and more focused.

---

**Your current thesis statement:**

> “So, this paper thinks governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights. But there are some points that governments should notice…”

Let’s improve this by making it:
- Clearer and more confident (no “this paper thinks,” just make your claim!)
- More specific (tell your reader exactly why governments should do this, and what main points you’ll address)

**Tips for a strong thesis:**
- Clearly answer the essay question/issue.
- Preview 2-3 main points you’ll discuss in your body paragraphs.
- Use precise and confident language.

---

**Guiding Questions:**
- Why do governments need to enforce stricter laws for migrant workers? (Your best reasons)
- What key points will your essay discuss? (E.g., controlling worker numbers, managing illegal migration, education, etc.)

**Here’s a possible structure for your thesis:**
> Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].

**Would you like to try writing your revised thesis statement now, based on these points? Just give it a try and I’ll give feedback!**

If you prefer, you can fill in this template:
> Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers, because _______________, _______________, and _______________.

Let me know your version! (Or ask for an example if you’re stuck.)

*Time:* 2025-11-20T05:52:01.185Z

**You:** ask an example

*Time:* 2025-11-20T05:52:53.145Z

**Assistant:** Of course! Here’s an example of a clear, confident, and specific thesis statement you could use for this essay:

> Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers, because regulation can prevent unemployment, reduce social problems caused by illegal migration, and promote better education and integration for these workers.

**Notice:**  
- It clearly states your main claim (what you think governments should do).  
- It previews the three key reasons your essay will discuss: regulating the number of workers (prevents unemployment), managing illegal migration (reduces social problems), and improving education (promotes integration).

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement in your own words now? If you’d like, you can use this structure and make any changes you want!

Let me know your version, and I’ll be here to help polish it with you.

*Time:* 2025-11-20T05:52:56.328Z

**You:** All in all, they actually need more migrant workers from other countries so they must enforce stricter law to safeguard their rights, and you will get more workers.  Revise topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-20T05:53:37.304Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! You’re making progress—thanks for sharing your ideas. Since we’ve just worked on revising your thesis statement, let’s now focus on improving the topic sentence for one of your body paragraphs. This will help connect your ideas clearly to your thesis and make your essay more organized.

---

### **Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision**

**Let’s choose the paragraph about controlling the number of migrant workers.**

Here’s the original topic sentence from your draft:
> “First of all, the governments should c control the number of migrant workers.”

#### **Feedback**
- The topic sentence could be clearer about *why* controlling the number of migrant workers is necessary — directly linking it to your thesis.
- It can use more precise, confident language (remove unnecessary words, fix grammar).

#### **Let’s connect it to your revised thesis.**
**Thesis:**  
> Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers, because regulation can prevent unemployment, reduce social problems caused by illegal migration, and promote better education and integration for these workers.

#### **Guiding Questions:**
- Why should governments control the number of migrant workers?
- How does this relate to preventing unemployment (your first main point in the thesis)?

#### **Example Structures:**
- To prevent unemployment and maintain a balanced labor market, governments should control the number of migrant workers through stricter regulations.
- Stricter regulation of migrant worker numbers is necessary to prevent unemployment and protect local workers.

---

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now?**
You can start with:  
> Governments should control the number of migrant workers because…

Just finish the sentence in your own words! Or use one of the example structures and adapt it as you like.

**Once you share your revised topic sentence, I’ll help you polish it—and then we’ll move on to revising the rest of your paragraph together.**

---

**Would you like to try now?**

*Time:* 2025-11-20T05:53:42.715Z

**You:** So, this paper thinks governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights. But there are some points that governments should notice.   Revise one body paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-20T05:57:49.125Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let’s work through Step 2 and Step 3 together, focusing on revising one body paragraph—starting with the topic sentence and then improving the rest of the paragraph to make it clearer, more connected, and well-developed.

---

## Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision

Let's focus on the paragraph about **controlling the number of migrant workers**.

**Original topic sentence:**  
> First of all, the governments should c control the number of migrant workers.

### Feedback:
- Make it clearer why controlling the number is important.
- Directly link it to your thesis statement’s first reason: *preventing unemployment and protecting the labor market*.
- Use precise, confident language; remove unnecessary words.

### Here are two model topic sentences for you to try or adapt:
- **To prevent unemployment and maintain a balanced labor market, governments should strictly regulate the number of migrant workers.**
- **By controlling the number of migrant workers, governments can help prevent job shortages and protect both migrant and local workers from unfair competition.**

---

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now?**  
You can use a similar structure, or write one in your own style!  
For example:  
> Governments should strictly regulate the number of migrant workers because _______________________.

Please share your revised topic sentence, and then we’ll move on to improving the whole paragraph.

---

## Step 3 — Revising the Rest of the Chosen Paragraph

Once you give me your new topic sentence, we’ll focus on these guiding questions to revise your supporting sentences:
- Do all sentences clearly relate to your topic sentence?
- Is the explanation clear and logically developed?
- Are there examples or details to show why regulation is important?
- Is your grammar and word choice accurate?

Here’s your **original paragraph** for reference:
> First of all , the governments should c control the number of migrant workers. In other words, the governments should notice demand and supply because if more and more low-price workers happen in the market, it will result in supply over the demand and the unemployment -rate will become higher because there will be more and more workers in the market.

### Suggestions for improvement:
- Explain *why* controlling numbers is important (e.g., balancing supply and demand in the labor market).
- Clarify how “low-price workers” and unemployment rates are affected.
- Use more accurate vocabulary (“low-wage workers” instead of “low-price workers”).

---

**Would you like to try rewriting one or two sentences to make your point clearer?**  
Here’s a possible sentence starter:
> When there are too many migrant workers, the job market can become overcrowded, which may increase unemployment and make it more difficult for workers to find fair jobs.

Try putting this idea into your own words, or revise one sentence at a time. You can share your version, and I’ll help you polish it!

---

**Revised Paragraph Example (for inspiration ONLY, not to copy directly):**  
> To prevent unemployment and maintain a balanced labor market, governments should strictly regulate the number of migrant workers. If too many low-wage workers enter the job market, the supply of workers may become higher than the demand for jobs. This oversupply can lead to increased unemployment and make it difficult for both migrant and local workers to find fair employment.

*Time:* 2025-11-20T05:57:57.081Z

**You:** how can i write better

*Time:* 2025-11-20T05:59:15.709Z

**Assistant:** I’m glad you asked—wanting to “write better” is a great goal, and you’re already making good progress by revising your essay step by step! Here’s how you can continue improving, with practical advice you can use right now:

---

## 1. **Set Clear Writing Goals**
Think about what “better” means for you. Do you want to:
- Make your ideas easier to understand (clarity)?
- Build stronger arguments with reasons and evidence?
- Make your essay easier to read by organizing it well?
- Use more accurate grammar and vocabulary?
Pick *one or two* goals to focus on at a time. If you’re not sure, try starting with clarity and organization!

---

## 2. **Practice with a Simple Structure**
Good essays use clear structures. For academic essays:
- **Introduction**: Say your main idea (thesis) and your main reasons.
- **Body Paragraphs**: Start with a topic sentence (one main reason), then give explanation and examples.
- **Conclusion**: Summarize the main points and restate the thesis in a new way.

Often, short sentences and paragraphs work better—especially when you’re learning.

---

## 3. **Make Your Sentences Clear and Specific**
- Use active voice (e.g., “Governments should enforce laws…”).
- Be confident and direct (avoid phrases like “I think,” “maybe”).
- Use transition words (first, next, finally, for example, therefore) to connect ideas.

If you’re explaining a reason, add a short example or explanation:
> When there are many migrant workers, the job market can become overcrowded. As a result, it is harder for everyone to find good jobs.

---

## 4. **Check Your Paragraphs**
After writing a paragraph, ask yourself:
- Does my topic sentence match the main point I want to make?
- Do my supporting sentences explain or give examples?
- Are all my sentences related to the topic sentence?
- Is my grammar correct? (Check word order, verb tense, subject–verb agreement.)

---

## 5. **Read and Revise**
Reading your writing out loud helps you hear problems! Try reading a paragraph and ask:
- Do I understand what I wrote?
- Is there a better way to say it?
- Did I use the same word many times? Can I use a synonym?

---

## 6. **Ask for Feedback**
You’re already doing this! Whenever you share your writing and ask for help, you’ll get better faster.

---

## Concrete Steps for *This Essay*:

Let’s use these ideas to keep improving your paragraph about **controlling migrant worker numbers**—

**Try This Revision Exercise:**
1. Write one clear topic sentence about what the paragraph is about (already done!).
2. Write two more sentences that *explain why* regulation is important, using active, clear language.
3. End with a sentence that connects to the bigger point (protecting all workers).

**For example:**
> To prevent unemployment and maintain a balanced labor market, governments should strictly regulate the number of migrant workers. If too many workers enter the job market, there may not be enough jobs for everyone. As a result, both migrant and local workers can have difficulty earning a fair income.

**Would you like to try writing your own version with these steps?**  
I’ll help you improve it sentence by sentence!

---

**Summary:**
To write better:
- Practice clear structure.
- Use confident, active sentences.
- Give good examples and explanations.
- Revise with feedback.

**Let me know your focus, and I’ll give you personalized, step-by-step help!**

*Time:* 2025-11-20T05:59:25.397Z

**You:** do you have some suggestions about my essay

*Time:* 2025-11-20T06:00:22.226Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely, and thank you for asking! You’re already working hard and showing commitment by revising your draft—so let’s focus on practical suggestions you can use right away to keep improving.

---

## **General Suggestions**

### **1. Clarify Your Thesis Statement**
- Make your main idea very clear (state *exactly* what governments should do and *why*).
- Avoid phrases like “this paper thinks…” and use direct, confident language.
- Preview your key reasons in the thesis.

### **2. Strengthen Organization**
- Start each body paragraph with a clear topic sentence that relates directly to your thesis.
- Use transition words ("first," "next," "finally") to guide your reader.

### **3. Develop Your Ideas**
- Don’t just list points—explain *how* and *why* each point matters, using examples if possible.
- For example, after saying "regulate the number of migrant workers," explain how too many workers can increase unemployment or create competition.

### **4. Improve Language Accuracy**
- Check grammar and sentence structure:
    - “economical level” → “economic level”
    - “create more price” → “increase production” or similar
    - “low-price workers” → “low-wage workers”
- Use simple, direct sentences.

### **5. Academic Tone**
- Avoid personal remarks (“Yes, of course!”) at the start.
- Stay objective and neutral—focus on facts and analysis.

### **6. Paragraph Structure**
- Each paragraph should focus on one main idea, presented at the start (topic sentence), followed by explanation and examples.

---

## **Quick Tips You Can Try Right Now**

- **Start your essay directly:**  
  Instead of “Yes, of course!”, open with a sentence stating your main argument.

- **Revise your thesis:**  
  Example:  
  > Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers, because regulation can prevent unemployment, reduce social problems, and promote better integration.

- **Topic sentence focus:**  
  For your first body paragraph, try:  
  > To prevent unemployment and maintain a balanced labor market, governments should strictly regulate the number of migrant workers.

- **Supporting Sentences:**
