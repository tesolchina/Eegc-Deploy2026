            ## Contribution Analysis

            It looks like in this session, the student repeatedly chose to “pretend” that revisions were made without pasting any actual revised thesis, topic sentence, or paragraph text. Because of this, the AI was unable to perform concrete review, targeted feedback, or iterative editing that would foster deeper learning and stronger essay development.

If your goal is to complete this assessment or support the student’s revision process effectively, here are some practical next steps and suggestions:

---

### Recommendations to Move Forward

1. **Request Actual Revised Texts**  
   Politely emphasize the need for the student to submit the **actual revised thesis sentence**, the **revised topic sentence**, and the **full body paragraph** with supporting sentences. Explain that without these, meaningful collaboration and feedback aren’t possible.

2. **Clarify Expectations About Revision**  
   Encourage the student to engage actively by producing and pasting real drafts—even imperfect attempts are better than placeholders. Assure them it’s a normal part of learning to experiment and get feedback.

3. **Offer a Model Revised Thesis and Topic Sentence**  
   If the student is unsure how to start, provide a simple, example thesis and topic sentence based on the data they mentioned, which they can adapt or respond to:
   - Example thesis:  
     *“In most of the selected countries, native-born populations demonstrate lower unemployment rates than migrants, suggesting that labor market integration varies with national context.”*
   - Example topic sentence for the paragraph:  
     *“The chart reveals that native-born residents tend to have lower unemployment rates than migrants in several powerful European countries, highlighting differences in labor market outcomes.”*

   Seeing a concrete example may help the student move beyond “pretend” responses.

4. **Encourage Picking Specific Revision Focus Areas**  
   Reinforce the importance of selecting one or two revision focus areas (clarity, grammar, evidence use, logical connection to thesis). Narrow focus coordinates productive effort.

5. **Suggest Breaking Down the Revision Process**  
   Propose revising one sentence at a time—starting with the topic sentence, then the first supporting sentence, etc.—to reduce overwhelm and build confidence.

---

### Summary for Instructor or Tutor Use

- The student engaged minimally in the collaborative revision process by using placeholders rather than submitting revised writing.  
- The AI tutor’s guidance was clear, scaffolded, and offered targeted sentence frames and strategies.  
- Without concrete student inputs, the iterative editing cycle and critical evaluation did not occur.  
- Recommend requiring or incentivizing actual text submission for future sessions to enable effective formative assessment.  
- Consider providing sample rewriting exercises and encouraging “trial” drafts in order to build student confidence in sharing imperfect work.

If you want, I can create a concise message template you can send to the student to encourage their active participation and submission of real revision text. Would you like me to draft that?

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 15/25 - The draft attempts to compare native-born and migrant employment outcomes across countries and references a chart ("the overall unemployment rate is 2.9% ~ 12.9%"), but the main claims are unclear and sometimes off-topic or speculative (e.g., "It implies that some Australian or wars to the Central Croatica where migrants tend to outperform the natives too"). The argument lacks a clear, defensible thesis and precise interpretation of the data.
- Organization: 15/25 - There is a basic paragraph structure (topic-like opening followed by supporting sentences), but the paragraph lacks a single controlling idea and logical progression. Sentences jump between claims (country comparisons, unemployment rates, "power of country") without clear transitions.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - The student attempts comparative and technical language ("outperforming," "overall unemployment rate"), but frequent awkward collocations and word-choice errors ("one give," "over-reveal," "pe power") reduce clarity and precision.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Numerous grammatical errors, punctuation problems, and awkward sentence structures significantly impede readability (examples below). These errors obscure intended meaning and make interpretation difficult.
- **Original Essay Total: 59/100**

Evidence (quoted):
- Opening sentence: "Overall, one give from the chart of those 10 selected countries, we can find that native-born population outperforming migrants' actions for more percentage than in opposite side."
- Vagueness/speculation: "It implies that some Australian or wars to the Central Croatica where migrants tend to outperform the natives too."
- Data mention: "the overall unemployment rate is 2.9% ~ 12.9%."

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 15/25 - The revised essay is identical to the original; no substantive changes were made to clarify ideas or align the argument with a coherent thesis.
- Organization: 15/25 - Structure remains the same; no improvement in paragraph focus or logical flow.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - No changes to vocabulary issues; awkward and incorrect word choices persist.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Grammar and sentence structure remain problematic; no corrections were implemented.
- **Revised Essay Total: 59/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None — the revised essay is unchanged from the original and contains the same errors.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Clarify and state a specific, relevant thesis (the chat workflow indicated a thesis would be revised but none was pasted).
  - Revise the topic sentence into a clear, precise claim tied to the thesis (the student repeatedly said "let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentence" but did not provide the revised sentence).
  - Edit sentences for grammar and clarity and incorporate specific data points from the chart to support claims (e.g., state exact percentages per country and explain their significance).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9 messages** (5 assistant messages; 4 user messages). The assistant provided an organized revision plan and diagnostics, while the student responded with brief directives to "pretend" revisions rather than providing actual revised text.
- **Conversation Quality:** Low to moderate. The assistant gave structured, targeted guidance and requested concrete inputs (revised thesis, revised topic sentence, paragraph). The student, however, repeatedly chose to "pretend" revisions instead of submitting actual revisions or answers, so the interaction contains minimal substantive student contributions or evidence of critical engagement.

Evidence from chat (selected quotes):
- Student placeholders: "let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on" (user), "let's pretend we have revised the topic sentence and move on" (user), "ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1" (user).
- Assistant requests that were not followed with content: "Please paste the revised thesis (one sentence)" and "Please paste the full paragraph as it currently stands."

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 - The assistant provided several detailed messages and a clear revision workflow, but the student's responses were brief and did not supply the substantive content (revised thesis/topic sentence/paragraph) needed for deeper, multi-level exchange. The chat length (9 messages) is short and lacks iterative content revisions.
  - Evidence: The assistant repeatedly asks for the revised thesis and paragraph; the student repeatedly replies with “let’s pretend…” instead of pasting revisions.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 - The student did not evaluate or critique the AI's suggestions. Instead of accepting, rejecting, or modifying specific recommendations, the student used placeholders ("pretend we have revised...") and provided no justification or selection of suggestions.
  - Evidence: No instances where the user commented on or justified any AI-proposed change; user responses are commands to move forward without content.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 - There is no evidence of an iterative revision cycle: the student did not produce or paste any revised thesis, topic sentence, or paragraph for the assistant to review and refine. The assistant offered a multi-step process, but the student did not complete those steps.
  - Evidence: The chat repeatedly returns to the assistant requesting the revised thesis and paragraph; the student never supplies them.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 4/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The assistant provided a clear, scaffolded revision plan with helpful sentence frames and targeted diagnostic feedback — good model of AI tutoring practice (evidence: assistant’s Step 1–Step 3 workflow and concrete sentence frames).
- The student shows some procedural awareness of the revision process (they repeatedly request to "move on" through steps), indicating they understand the stages of revision even though they did not supply content.
- The draft attempts to reference quantitative data (the overall unemployment range "2.9% ~ 12.9%"), showing an awareness that evidence is needed.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- The student must produce actual revised text (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph) rather than asking to "pretend" revisions; without concrete input, meaningful revision and assessment are impossible.
- Improve clarity of argument: write a single, explicit thesis connected to the assignment prompt and ensure every paragraph has a topic sentence that clearly links to that thesis.
- Substantively edit sentences for grammar, vocabulary precision, and logical coherence; replace vague phrases and correct collocations.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student did not provide the revised thesis or confirm the topic sentence text despite the assistant’s repeated requests; minimal contextual inputs were given beyond the original paragraph.
  - Evidence: Repeated assistant prompts: "Please paste the revised thesis (one sentence)" were unanswered with content.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good (assistant demonstrates planning); Student: Needs Improvement - The assistant gave a clear plan, but the student did not follow through with the planned steps.
  - Evidence: Assistant’s three-step plan vs. student’s lack of concrete follow-up.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - No evidence that the student evaluated AI suggestions or justified acceptance/rejection.
  - Evidence: No chat messages where the user assesses or comments on proposed changes.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The student did not perform independent edits of thesis, topic sentence, or paragraph in the chat.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Submit concrete revisions: paste the revised thesis sentence and the revised topic sentence (or the full revised paragraph). The assistant cannot provide meaningful, iterative help without those inputs.
2. Focus on one clear claim: write a concise thesis that directly answers the assignment prompt; ensure every paragraph begins with a topic sentence that clearly ties to that thesis.
3. Perform targeted sentence-level editing: correct grammar and word choice (e.g., replace "one give" with "from the chart," remove duplicated words like "striking striking," clarify country references like "Croatia" instead of "Central Croatica"). Use the assistant’s sentence frames to rewrite unclear sentences.
4. When collaborating with AI, explicitly evaluate suggestions: accept, adapt, or reject specific AI edits and explain why—this strengthens critical engagement and learning.
5. Use specific data: cite exact percentages or comparisons from the chart and explain how they support your claims.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student did not complete the assigned revision tasks in the chat: no revised thesis, no revised topic sentence, and no revised body paragraph were provided. The "revised" essay file is identical to the original.
- Because the student repeatedly indicated they were "pretending" to have revised text rather than pasting actual revisions, the AI could not perform or assess substantive revision work. Recommend asking the student to resubmit with the actual revised thesis and paragraph for a full formative assessment.
- If the assignment requires demonstration of human-AI iterative editing, remind the student that a dialogic process requires producing and evaluating draft text at each step; otherwise, grading for collaboration skills must reflect the current minimal engagement.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Overall, one give from the chart of those 10 selected countries, we can find that native-born population outperforming migrants' actions for more percentage than in opposite side. And the overall unemployment rate is 2.9% ~ 12.9%.
The data shows that powerful countries in Europe tends to have more native-born population outperforming migrants' rate than other countries. As we can see, the Spain, via the country which whose rate is most featuring a in over-reveal unemployment rate, also is the country where native-born population tends to perform outperform the migrants. It implies that some Australian or wars to the Central Croatica where migrants tend to outperform the natives too. We'll implies that the overall unemployment rate is connected to the rate gap of performance between natives and migrants. When vote gap goes bigger, the overall unemployment rate tends to raise as well.
On the other hands, the same countries tend to have more rate of her migrants outperform out-performing native population, in From the chart, Croatia and Slovakia whose population gets the way smaller than other countries is selected, have tent a striking striking rate of overall unemployment rate. Compare to those countries who have less rate, then we can find that the data of pe power of country can be a important type crucial factor to the rate of use unemployment and rate gap between nations and immigrants.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-04T09:58:55.968Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on

*Time:* 2025-12-04T10:00:47.760Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s get started. First I’ll ask a few quick questions so we can set clear targets, then I’ll give a short diagnostic of your draft. After you confirm which problems you want to focus on, we’ll move into Step 2 (topic sentence revision) — as you requested, we’ll pretend the thesis has already been revised, but I’ll need you to confirm or paste that revised thesis so I can check alignment.

1) Negotiate targets
- What are your personal goals for this session? Which of these do you most want to improve today (pick up to two): clarity, argument strength, paragraph structure/coherence, use of evidence, grammar and sentence correctness, or style/word choice?
- If you have another specific target, tell me now.

2) Quick diagnostic feedback (using rubric categories)
I reviewed your original draft. Here are strengths and main areas for improvement linked to common rubric categories.

- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: You attempt to make comparative claims based on a chart (so there is an interpretive claim).
  - Areas to improve: The draft currently does not address the assigned prompt about climate change individual vs. government action. If your revised thesis now addresses the prompt, we must ensure each paragraph ties to that thesis. The current argumentative claims are unclear and mixed (native vs migrants, unemployment rates) and don’t form a clear position.

- Organization
  - Strengths: You show an attempt at topic-comment structure (topic sentence followed by supporting sentences).
  - Areas to improve: Paragraph lacks a clear, single controlling idea. Sentences often jump between ideas (country comparisons, unemployment rates, migrants vs natives) without clear transitions or logical ordering.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: You attempt to reference data (a chart of 10 countries).
  - Areas to improve: Evidence is referenced vaguely (“the chart,” “powerful countries”) without specific figures or clear interpretation. Connections between data and your claims are unclear or speculative.

- Language Use (grammar, clarity, style)
  - Strengths: You try to use comparative language (“outperform,” “tend to”).
  - Areas to improve: Many grammar errors, word choice problems, and sentence fragments make meaning hard to follow. Avoid repeated words and unclear phrasing (“one give,” “via the country which whose rate is most featuring a in over-reveal”).

Summary diagnosis: The biggest priorities are (1) clarity of argument and alignment with the essay prompt (make sure the thesis answers the question about climate change individual vs government action), (2) a clear topic sentence that links the paragraph to the thesis, and (3) language and sentence-level correctness so readers can follow your logic.

3) Student priority selection
Which of the diagnosed weaknesses do you want us to focus on in this session? Pick one or two:
- Make the paragraph clearly connect to the (revised) thesis / improve logical connection to prompt
- Strengthen the paragraph’s topic sentence so it previews the paragraph and ties to the thesis
- Improve clarity and grammar in the paragraph’s sentences
- Better use and explanation of the data/ evidence

Please confirm your choices before we move on.

4) Before Step 2: confirm the revised thesis
You asked us to pretend the thesis has been revised and move on. Can you paste that revised thesis here (or write its main claim in one sentence)? I need it so I can check connection between thesis and the paragraph’s topic sentence.

Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision (ready to begin once you confirm targets and paste the revised thesis)
- Which body paragraph would you like to work on? (There’s one paragraph in the draft — that’s fine.)
- Please paste the paragraph’s current topic sentence (or tell me if you want me to identify the first sentence as the topic sentence).

Initial feedback on the paragraph’s likely topic sentence (the first sentence in your draft appears to be the topic sentence):
Current sentence: “Overall, one give from the chart of those 10 selected countries, we can find that native-born population outperforming migrants' actions for more percentage than in opposite side.”
Quick notes on this sentence and how to improve the connection to the revised thesis:
- Clarity: The sentence is hard to understand because of grammar and word choice. Decide on one clear claim (e.g., “In the chart, native-born residents in most of the sampled countries show higher employment rates than migrants” — this is just a content example; we won’t fully rewrite it for you).
- Focus: A topic sentence should (a) state the paragraph’s main point and (b) connect that point to your thesis. If your thesis argues that individual actions matter for climate change, the paragraph’s topic sentence should clearly say how this data/example supports that claim (or how it doesn’t).
- Specificity: Replace vague phrases (“one give,” “for more percentage,” “in opposite side”) with precise language: what exactly is being compared, and what trend does the data show?
- Confidence: Use assertive phrasing (avoid hedges like “tend to” unless the data is ambiguous). Use present simple for general findings (“shows,” “indicates”).

Helpful sentence frames (fill in the brackets with your specifics — these are templates, not full rewrites):
- “The chart of 10 countries shows that [specific pattern], which supports the claim that [how this relates to your thesis].”
- “In particular, [country A] and [country B] display [statistic or trend], suggesting that [interpretation connected to thesis].”
- “This pattern is important for my argument because it indicates that [link to thesis].”

Would you like to try revising that topic sentence now using one of these frames? Type your revised topic sentence and I’ll give focused feedback and brief edits. Once we have a strong topic sentence, we’ll move to Step 3 and work on the supporting sentences in that paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T10:01:28.661Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the topic sentence and move on

*Time:* 2025-12-04T10:02:37.860Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. Before I jump into revising the paragraph’s supporting sentences, two quick things so we follow our agreed workflow.

1) Pick targets (choose up to two)
Which of these do you want us to focus on for the paragraph’s revision?
- Make the paragraph clearly connect to the thesis / improve logical connection to the prompt
- Strengthen the paragraph’s topic sentence so it previews the paragraph and ties to the thesis
- Improve clarity and grammar in the paragraph’s sentences
- Better use and explanation of the data/evidence

Tell me your choices now.

2) Paste the revised thesis (one sentence)
I need the revised thesis sentence (or a one-sentence summary of it) so I can check alignment between the thesis and the paragraph’s supporting sentences. You said we should pretend the topic sentence has been revised — that’s fine, but I still need the thesis.

Next step after you answer those two items
- Paste the full paragraph as it currently stands (with the revised topic sentence if you have it). If you prefer, you can paste only the supporting sentences (everything after the topic sentence).
- Tell me if you want to try revising one supporting sentence yourself first, or if you want guided hints for each sentence.

I’ll then:
- Ask a few focused questions about the paragraph’s evidence and logic,
- Give short, targeted suggestions and example phrasing (not full rewrites),
- Encourage you to try a revision, and give quick feedback until the paragraph is clearer and aligned with your thesis.

Would you like to choose targets and paste the revised thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-12-04T10:02:55.893Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentence and move on

*Time:* 2025-12-04T10:03:22.439Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. I’m ready to move on with the paragraph-level revision. A few quick choices so we stay focused.

1) Pick up to two targets for this paragraph (which problems should I help you fix now?)
- Make the paragraph clearly connect to the thesis / improve logical connection to the prompt
- Strengthen the paragraph’s topic sentence so it previews the paragraph and ties to the thesis
- Improve clarity and grammar in the paragraph’s sentences
- Better use and explanation of the data/evidence

Which one or two do you want us to focus on?

2) I still need the revised thesis (one sentence)
You said we should pretend the thesis is revised — please paste that revised thesis here (or type a one-sentence summary of it). I need it so the paragraph’s ideas clearly align with the main claim.

3) Paste the paragraph
Please paste the full paragraph as it currently stands. You said to pretend the topic sentence is already revised — please include the revised topic sentence at the top of the paragraph. If you don’t have that ready, tell me and I can (briefly) suggest a tight topic-sentence option for you to accept or tweak.

4) How would you like to work on the supporting sentences?
- I’ll try revising one supporting sentence and you’ll give feedback (I prefer this)
- Give me short guided hints and a couple of example phrases for each sentence (I prefer this)

Tell me your choices for 1 and 4, and paste the revised thesis + paragraph. Then we’ll move into Step 3 and work sentence-by-sentence. Would you like to go ahead and paste those now?

*Time:* 2025-12-04T10:03:40.122Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1

*Time:* 2025-12-04T10:03:55.103Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m ready to help revise the rest of paragraph #1. Before we start, two quick things so we follow our agreed workflow.

1) Choose revision targets (pick up to two)
Which of these should we focus on for this paragraph?
- Make the paragraph clearly connect to the thesis / improve logical connection to the prompt
- Strengthen the paragraph’s topic sentence so it previews the paragraph and ties to the thesis
- Improve clarity and grammar in the paragraph’s sentences
- Better use and explanation of the data/evidence

2) Paste the revised thesis (one sentence)
I need the revised thesis (or a one-sentence summary of it) so I can check that the paragraph’s ideas and evidence align with your main claim. You said we should pretend the thesis is revised — please paste it now.

3) Paste the paragraph (with topic sentence)
Please paste the full paragraph as it currently stands. If you already revised the topic sentence, include that version at the top. If you haven’t revised the topic sentence yet, say so — I can offer a tight topic-sentence option for you to accept or tweak before we edit the supporting sentences.

4) How would you like to work on the supporting sentences?
Pick one:
- I’ll try revising one supporting sentence and you’ll give feedback (I prefer this)
- Give me short guided hints and 1–2 example phrases for each sentence (I prefer this)

Once you reply with: (a) your chosen targets, (b) the revised thesis, (c) the paragraph (or confirmation you want a suggested topic sentence), and (d) your preferred working method, we’ll move sentence-by-sentence through the paragraph. Would you like to paste those now?
