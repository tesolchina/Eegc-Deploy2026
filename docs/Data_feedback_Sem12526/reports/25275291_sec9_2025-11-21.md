# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The student has a clear stance (technology will enhance employment) and mentions two plausible mechanisms (automation frees people for creative work; need for monitoring/maintenance creates jobs). However, ideas are only lightly developed and examples are vague (e.g., “Marketing… company could employ more employee for creative marketing strategy”) and do not convincingly explain causal mechanisms.
- Organization: 18/25 - The draft has a recognizable structure (intro, body paragraphs, conclusion). Topic sentences and transitions are weak, and some sentences drift from the main idea, reducing paragraph unity.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - The student attempts topic-specific words (“technological shift,” “automation,” “AI”), but frequent collocation and word-formation errors (e.g., “employee prospective,” “basic works,” “assistence”) make phrasing awkward and imprecise.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Frequent grammar, spelling and punctuation errors (e.g., “destory,” “Mechine,” verb agreement issues, misplaced commas) often impede clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 65/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 19/25 - The revised draft keeps the same overall argument and attempts to strengthen the thesis (multiple thesis attempts appear). Paragraph B in the assistant-produced revision adds clearer mechanisms (e.g., biased outputs → need for data auditors). However, the student’s supplied "revised" version (the one in the input) still duplicates content and remains repetitive, so content development only marginally improved.
- Organization: 17/25 - The revised version shows attempts to clarify the thesis and to expand the monitoring/maintenance paragraph, but the “revised” text contains duplicated sentences and repeated ideas (e.g., repeated sentences about routine tasks). Topic sentences remain uneven and transitions are still weak.
- Vocabulary: 16/25 - Minor improvements in word choice in some places (e.g., “monitor,” “bias”), but many errors persist and there are new duplications and unnatural collocations in the submitted revised text.
- Grammar: 15/25 - Some grammar corrections are present in portions revised by the assistant (e.g., clearer clause linking in paragraph about monitoring). Nevertheless, the student’s submitted revised file still contains many errors, repeated phrases, and punctuation/spacing issues.
- **Revised Essay Total: 67/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +2 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - The student (or the assistant working with the student) attempted to produce a clearer, stronger thesis that states position and lists reasons (e.g., “Technological change enhances global employment prospects by automating routine tasks and creating demand for new skilled jobs…”).
  - The monitoring/maintenance paragraph (paragraph B) was expanded to explain the mechanism: biased outputs → need for human oversight → jobs such as data auditors and quality-control staff.
  - There is some better linkage between technology’s limitations and the need for human roles in the revised paragraph B (more explicit causal explanation than in the original).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Remove duplicated sentences and repeated phrases. The revised submission contains literal repetition (e.g., duplicated lines and near-duplicate sentences), which reduces clarity and harms the Organization score.
  - Topic sentences remain weak or were not clearly revised by the student. The first body paragraph still needs a clearer, tighter topic sentence that connects directly to the thesis.
  - More concrete, concise examples and short specifics (a named industry example, a short statistic, or a brief micro-case) would strengthen Evidence & Development and make the argument more convincing.
  - Global grammar clean-up remains necessary (articles, pluralization, verb agreement, spelling, punctuation).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 32** (counting each assistant and user message in the provided chat history)
- **Conversation Quality:** Robust, iterative, and goal-oriented. The assistant provided a clear multi-step revision workflow and concrete editing guidance; the student engaged with priorities (chose thesis clarity and sentence-level grammar) and iteratively posted multiple thesis drafts and paragraph text. The interaction shows negotiation of goals, targeted revision attempts, and several cycles of feedback.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - Evidence: The chat comprises many exchanges (32 turns), includes a structured, multi-step revision plan from the assistant, and shows repeated back-and-forth as the student and assistant refine the thesis, discuss priorities, and address paragraph revisions. The assistant provided rubric-based diagnostics and stepwise tasks; the student engaged across multiple rounds.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - Evidence: The student did not accept all AI suggestions uncritically. For example, the student resisted including a preview in the thesis (“my hole passage has explained the reasons don't need to preview”) and argued for keeping elements of their phrasing. The student also asserted completion of steps at one point (“We have already finish step123”), indicating they evaluated and judged the process. However, many final revisions appear to have been implemented by the assistant rather than by the student independently; the student did not always provide evidence-based justification for accepting or rejecting suggestions.
- **Refining Process**: 4/5 - Evidence: Multiple revision cycles are visible: the assistant proposed a three-step process (revise thesis → choose paragraph topic sentence → revise paragraph); the student provided several thesis drafts and paragraph texts; the assistant produced edited versions. This shows iterative work, though the student sometimes relied on the assistant to do the rewriting and occasionally declared steps finished before completing some subtasks (e.g., no clear student-produced revised topic sentence was submitted).

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 13/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student has a clear, defendable main claim: the essay consistently argues that technology will not cause long-term net unemployment but will change the nature of jobs.
  - Evidence: multiple thesis attempts such as “Technological change enhances global employment prospects by automating routine tasks and creating demand for new skilled jobs…”
- The student engaged in a sustained revision process and set clear priorities (thesis clarity and sentence-level grammar).
  - Evidence: explicit choices in chat (“1.a and c.”; later “stronger thesis and sentence‑level grammar”) and multiple iterative attempts.
- The student sought sentence-level guidance and accepted some specific grammar and structural recommendations (the assistant’s revised paragraph B supplies a clearer mechanism and job examples).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Produce and submit your own revised topic sentence(s): the interaction shows an assistant-led rewrite of paragraph B but the student did not post a student-authored revised topic sentence. Recommendation: when revising, craft and paste your own new topic sentence before asking the assistant to polish it.
- Reduce reliance on assistant rewriting; practice more independent editing to internalize grammar corrections. Recommendation: after the assistant gives edits, try to make them yourself first, then ask for targeted feedback.
- Global grammar and proofreading: fix consistent errors—articles, plural/singular forms, spelling, spacing, and punctuation. Recommendation: run a final pass to correct recurring errors (e.g., “employee prospective” → “employment prospects”; “in a more faster speed” → “more quickly/at a faster rate”).
- Remove repetitions and duplicated lines in the revised submission. Recommendation: read the whole draft top-to-bottom and remove literally repeated sentences before submission.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the essay text, selected revision targets, and clarified goals (“stronger thesis and sentence‑level grammar”). Evidence: multiple pasted essay versions and explicit target choices in chat.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student engaged with the assistant’s three-step plan and chose priorities (A and C) to focus revision efforts.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Developing/Good - The student questioned some AI suggestions (e.g., about thesis preview) and claimed ownership of decisions, but did not consistently provide evidence-based reasons for accepting or rejecting suggestions.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - Much of the final revision content appears to have been produced or heavily shaped by the assistant; the student did not consistently submit self-authored revised sentences/paragraphs for inspection.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Before asking the assistant to polish, produce and paste your own revised sentence/paragraph first. This builds independent editing skills and makes the collaboration more clearly bidirectional.
2. Run a systematic proofreading pass focused on recurring errors (articles, pluralization, verb agreement, spelling). Create a short personal error list from this essay to address in future drafts.
3. Strengthen topic sentences so each body paragraph clearly links back to the thesis (use parallel vocabulary from the thesis to make the structural link explicit). Add one brief, concrete detail in each example to strengthen evidence (e.g., a short real-world job title or a simple illustrative result).

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student engaged actively and iteratively with the AI tutor and selected appropriate priorities (thesis clarity and sentence-level grammar). However, they appear to have relied on the assistant to perform many final rewrites rather than producing self-authored revisions for the topic sentence and body paragraph. According to the module rubric, the student should demonstrate the ability to apply AI suggestions and produce revised text themselves; at present, this is partial.
- The submitted "revised" essay still includes duplicated content and many persistent grammar issues. I recommend the instructor ask the student to (a) produce a single clean final draft with duplications removed and (b) submit a short reflection that: (i) lists AI suggestions they accepted and why, (ii) lists suggestions they rejected and why, and (iii) describes what they personally revised. This will provide evidence of critical evaluation and independent editing.

If you would like, I can now:
- Run one final, focused grammar-and-proofread pass on the whole essay (paragraph-by-paragraph), or
- Guide the student to write a student-authored revised topic sentence for paragraph A and give targeted feedback on it.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
  Recently the technological shift ultimately improve or destory global employment prospects in the long term is an ongoing debate.Although there are some people who argue that technological shift ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term, while as far as I am concerned, this technological shift ultimately enhance it.
  First of all, technological can help employment work on some basic works, which provide people an opportunity to finish some creative and innovative jobs that we used don't have enough time to do.For example, like Marketing, with AI's assistence, company could employ more employee for creative marketing strategy inside of basic directly marketing and personal saleing.
  Second,it is not enough for technology like robot,Internet,AI truly replaced people in some areas,but it's not enough so far.Technology might produce some mistakes if they lack of human's monitor.For example,If Mechine Learning system produce outputs based on wrong or bias data, it may harm for people to use.In some extent, it may lead to AI minic people's situation.In that case, company need to hire some employees to monitor technology work to ensure it's correct outputs. So, even though technology replace some job opportunities for human. At the same time ,it also create some new jobs for human.
  In my opinion, technology not only will not undermine global employee prospective ,but also enhance global employment prospects in amore faster speed.

Revised:
  Recently the technological shift ultimately improve or destory global employment prospects in the long term is an ongoing debate.Although there are some people who argue that technological shift ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term, while as far as I am concerned, this technological shift ultimately enhance it by replacing people in some routine tasks and employment prospects, so it will not cause long‑term net unemployment.
  First of all, While technology eliminates some routine jobs, it ultimately improves overall employment prospects by automating routine tasks and creating demand for new skilled roles.For example, like Marketing, with AI's assistence, company could employ more employee for creative marketing strategy inside of basic directly marketing and personal saleing.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-21T01:27:18.152Z

**You:** hihihihi,  can you give me some feedback on aspects including but
not limited to: paragraph structure (e.g. coherence, flow), sentence
construction (e.g. grammar, variety), and vocabulary naturalness (e.g.
appropriateness, precision),based on my original essay?

*Time:* 2025-11-21T01:50:05.745Z

**Assistant:** Great — I can help with that. Before I give detailed feedback, let’s set clear targets so our session focuses on what matters most to you.

1) Quick goal check
- What are your personal goals for this essay? (Choose any: clarity of argument, stronger thesis, paragraph structure/coherence, sentence-level grammar, vocabulary/naturalness, better examples/evidence, or exam-style score improvement.)
- Which of those would you most like to focus on in this session? (Pick up to two.)

2) Diagnostic feedback (short, rubric-based)
I’ve read your draft. Below is a brief diagnosis using four rubric categories: Thesis & Argument, Organization, Evidence & Development, Language Use. I highlight strengths first, then areas to improve.

- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: You take a clear position — you argue that technological change enhances global employment prospects.
  - Needs work: The thesis is unclear and grammatically incorrect, and it doesn’t preview the main points clearly. (The sentence “In my opinion, technology not only will not undermine global employee prospective ,but also enhance global employment prospects in amore faster speed.” is confusing and hedged by awkward phrasing.)

- Organization
  - Strengths: Essay has the basic structure: intro, two body paragraphs, and a concluding sentence.
  - Needs work: Topic sentences are weak or unclear and don’t clearly connect back to a stronger thesis. Transitions are minimal, so paragraphs feel disjointed. Paragraph unity could be improved—some sentences drift from the main idea.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: You attempt to use examples (marketing/AI, monitoring systems).
  - Needs work: Examples are vague and underdeveloped. They need clearer explanation and tighter links to the claim (how exactly do these examples create jobs? By what mechanism? Provide brief concrete details).

- Language Use (grammar, sentence construction, vocabulary)
  - Strengths: You try to use academic vocabulary (e.g., “technological shift,” “enhance,” “replace”).
  - Needs work: Frequent grammar and word-formation errors (article use, verb forms, plurals, prepositions), misspellings, and unnatural collocations that make meaning unclear. Example issues:
    - “destory” → destroy; “assistence” → assistance; “Mechine” → machine.
    - Word choice/collocations: “help employment work on some basic works” is awkward; “company could employ more employee” → grammar + countability issues.
    - Sentence fragments and punctuation errors: many sentences need clearer subject–verb agreement and smoother punctuation.

3) Recommended priorities (my suggestion)
If you want guidance on two areas, I recommend:
- Fix the thesis (so it clearly answers the question and previews the main points).
- Improve language use (grammar and clearer word choices) so your ideas are readable.

If you prefer to focus on structure/argument instead, we can do thesis + one body paragraph (topic sentence + paragraph revision). Tell me which you prefer.

4) Your choice
Which of these issues would you like us to focus on in this session? Options:
A. Thesis clarity & strength (required before we do topic sentences)
B. Topic sentence + paragraph unity for one chosen paragraph
C. Sentence-level grammar & vocabulary (word choice, articles, verb forms)
D. Evidence development (make your examples clearer and more convincing)

Please pick up to two (for example: “A and C” or “A and B”). Once you confirm, paste or confirm your current thesis sentence (or say “use the final sentence in my draft”), and we’ll begin Step 1: revising the thesis.

Would you like to try choosing targets now?

*Time:* 2025-11-21T01:50:30.163Z

**You:** 1. sentence-level grammar, stronger thesis
2.C and D

*Time:* 2025-11-21T01:55:34.810Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a helpful start. Before we begin revising, let’s confirm exactly what you want to work on so I can focus feedback.

Quick summary of strengths and main problems (short):
- Strengths: clear position (you say technology will enhance employment); basic essay structure and some examples.
- Main problems: thesis is unclear/awkward; sentences have many grammar and word-choice errors; examples need clearer explanation and stronger links to your claim.

You wrote two notes: “1. sentence-level grammar, stronger thesis” and “2.C and D.” I want to be sure which two targets you want us to focus on (remember we should pick up to two):

Choices:
A = Thesis clarity & strength
B = Topic sentence + paragraph unity
C = Sentence-level grammar & vocabulary
D = Evidence development (make examples clearer)

Which two do you want? I recommend A (thesis) plus C (sentence-level grammar) because we must fix the thesis before rewriting topic sentences, and clearer grammar will make your revised thesis and paragraph readable. But if you prefer C and D (grammar + evidence), that’s fine too.

Please confirm:
1) Your chosen targets (pick two: e.g., “A and C” or “C and D”).
2) The current thesis to revise — paste it here or say “use the final sentence in my draft” (that sentence is: “In my opinion, technology not only will not undermine global employee prospective ,but also enhance global employment prospects in amore faster speed.”).

Once you confirm those two things, we’ll start Step 1: revise the thesis. Would you like to proceed?

*Time:* 2025-11-21T01:55:53.748Z

**You:** 1.a and c. 2.  Although there are some people who argue that technological shift ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term, while as far as I am concerned, this technological shift ultimately enhance it.

*Time:* 2025-11-21T01:57:48.609Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming targets A (thesis) and C (sentence-level grammar) and for pasting your current thesis. That gives us a clear place to start.

Quick feedback on the thesis you gave:
- Problems to fix:
  - Grammar/word form: verbs and agreement are incorrect (“shift ultimately undermine” → needs subject–verb agreement and correct tense).
  - Wordiness and awkward connectors (“while as far as I am concerned” is redundant).
  - Lack of preview: it doesn’t tell the reader the main reasons you will use to support your view.
  - Unclear extent: the prompt asks “to what extent” — your position should say whether you strongly disagree, partly disagree, etc.
  - Tone: avoid hedging and personal phrases like “in my opinion.” Use confident, academic phrasing.

What a strong thesis should do (quick checklist)
- Directly answer the question and state your position (e.g., “I disagree” or “I partly disagree”).
- Preview 2–3 clear reasons you will develop in the essay.
- Use clear, grammatical language and avoid personal hedges.

Try revising the thesis now. I’ll correct grammar and help sharpen it once you write a new version. Here are useful sentence frames you can use—fill the blanks rather than copying a finished sentence (this helps you practice and keeps us interactive):

- Frame A (strong disagreement): “I disagree that technological change will harm global employment; instead, it will increase job opportunities because it ______, ______, and ______.”
- Frame B (partial agreement/nuanced): “I partly disagree: while technology eliminates some routine jobs, it ultimately improves overall employment prospects by ______, ______, and ______.”
- Frame C (strong agreement that it helps — concise): “Technological change enhances global employment prospects by ______ and ______, so I do not believe it will cause long‑term net job loss.”

Pick one frame and fill the blanks with two or three reasons you want to argue (e.g., “creates new industries,” “requires oversight and maintenance,” “boosts productivity and demand for new skills”). Then paste your revised thesis here and I’ll help correct grammar and sharpen phrasing. Would you like to try one now?

*Time:* 2025-11-21T01:58:14.959Z

**You:** First,for the grammar can you give clear guide of which word or sentence I need to revise. Second,my hole passage has explained the reasons don't need to preview.

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:02:12.368Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — these are good questions. I’ll answer both clearly and simply so you can revise with confidence.

1) Clear, specific grammar guidance (focused on your thesis sentence)
I’ll point out the exact words/phrases in your thesis that need revision and tell you what to change or check. I won’t rewrite the whole sentence for you — I’ll give corrections and patterns so you can try a revised version.

Your original thesis (for reference)
In my opinion, technology not only will not undermine global employee prospective ,but also enhance global employment prospects in amore faster speed.

Problems and what to fix (itemized)
- “In my opinion,”
  - Why: Academic essays don’t need this phrase; it’s redundant and weakens tone.
  - Fix: Remove it or replace with a confident phrase if you need one (but removal is best).

- “technology not only will not undermine … but also enhance …”
  - Why: Parallel structure and verb forms are wrong. “Not only … but also …” requires parallel grammar.
  - Fix patterns you can use:
    - “technology will not only fail to undermine X, but will also enhance Y”
    - “technology will not undermine X but will enhance Y”
    - “I disagree that technology will undermine X; instead, it will enhance Y”
  - Key point: make the verbs parallel (both clauses should have a matching verb form).

- “employee prospective”
  - Why: word choice/spelling. Should be a noun phrase meaning “chances of getting jobs.”
  - Fix: “employment prospects”

- “in amore faster speed”
  - Why: spelling and unnatural phrase.
  - Fix options: “at a faster rate,” “more quickly,” or “more rapidly”

- Punctuation/spacing
  - Why: there’s a space before the comma and missing space after words like “in amore”.
  - Fix: Remove space before comma, add a space after commas, and correct spacing around words.

Put together, the main grammar fixes you need are: remove hedging (“in my opinion”), make verbs parallel, correct word choice (“employment prospects”), correct the adverb phrase (“at a faster rate”), and fix punctuation/spacing.

2) Brief note on your comment: “my whole passage has explained the reasons so I don’t need to preview”
I understand why you feel that way — you did explain reasons in the body paragraphs. However, for clarity and for a stronger essay structure, a thesis that previews your main reasons is usually better because:

- Reader guidance: the thesis tells the reader what to expect and how your essay is organized.
- Coherence: topic sentences can directly connect back to the thesis, making each paragraph clearly linked.
- Rubric/assessor expectations: many graders expect a thesis that answers the question and briefly states the main reasons.

That said, you don’t need a long list in the thesis. You can preview two short reasons (e.g., “creates new jobs” and “requires human oversight/skilled work”) or you can state the degree of agreement clearly without fully listing reasons (but listing helps). For this session (we chose A + C), I recommend including 1–2 short previews so we can connect topic sentences to the thesis easily.

Next step — your move
Please try one of the short thesis frames below and fill the blanks. Don’t worry — I’ll check and correct grammar after you write it.

Pick one frame and fill it in:
- Frame 1 (strong): “I disagree that technological change will cause long‑term net job losses; instead, it will increase employment because it ______ and ______.”
- Frame 2 (nuanced): “I partly disagree: while technology eliminates some routine jobs, it ultimately improves overall employment prospects by ______ and ______.”
- Frame 3 (concise): “Technological change enhances global employment prospects by ______, so it will not cause long‑term net unemployment.”

Fill the blanks with short reasons like “creates new industries,” “generates demand for skilled workers,” “requires monitoring and maintenance,” or “boosts productivity and consumer demand.”

Would you like to try revising your thesis now using one of those frames? Paste your attempt here and I’ll give quick, focused grammar corrections and confirm when it’s ready to move to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:02:51.646Z

**You:** ok let's talk about the topic sentences reason and body paragraph's structure.(step2 and 3)Frame C;1.technological can help employment work on some basic works, which provide people an opportunity to finish some creative and innovative jobs that we used don't have enough time to do.2.Second,it is not enough for technology like robot,Internet,AI truly replaced people in some areas,but it's not enough so far.At the same time ,it also create some new jobs for human.

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:10:31.435Z

**Assistant:** Great — you’ve picked Steps 2 and 3 (topic sentence + paragraph structure), which is perfect. Before we jump in, we must finish Step 1: a clear, concise thesis that previews the two reasons you’ll use. That makes the topic sentences easier to connect to the thesis.

Could you do two quick things for me?

1) Please write one short thesis sentence now using Frame C:
- Frame C: “Technological change enhances global employment prospects by ______, so it will not cause long‑term net unemployment.”
Fill the blank with two short reasons you plan to use (for example: “creating new creative and skilled jobs” and “generating demand for monitoring/maintenance and new services”). Try to write it yourself first — I’ll then give focused grammar and phrasing edits.

2) Which body paragraph do you want us to revise (Step 2 + 3)?
- Paragraph A (your first body paragraph): idea = technology frees people from basic/routine tasks so they can do creative and innovative work (marketing example).
- Paragraph B (your second body paragraph): idea = technology doesn’t fully replace humans and creates jobs for monitoring/maintenance and quality control.

Tell me:
- Your thesis attempt (paste it here), and
- Which paragraph you want to work on (A or B). Also paste that whole paragraph (so I can see the topic sentence plus supporting sentences).

Ready when you are — paste the thesis and the paragraph you chose and we’ll start Step 1 correction then move to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:11:09.107Z

**You:** 1.Technological change enhances global employment prospects by replacing people in some basic works and creating some new jobs for human,so it will not cause long‑term net unemployment.”
2.A+B
First of all, technological can help employment work on some basic works, which provide people an opportunity to finish some creative and innovative jobs that we used don't have enough time to do.For example, like Marketing, with AI's assistence, company could employ more employee for creative marketing strategy inside of basic directly marketing and personal saleing.
  Second,it is not enough for technology like robot,Internet,AI truly replaced people in some areas,but it's not enough so far.Technology might produce some mistakes if they lack of human's monitor.For example,If Mechine Learning system produce outputs based on wrong or bias data, it may harm for people to use.In some extent, it may lead to AI minic people's situation.In that case, company need to hire some employees to monitor technology work to ensure it's correct outputs. So, even though technology replace some job opportunities for human. At the same time ,it also create some new jobs for human.

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:17:28.496Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a helpful draft. Let’s confirm the plan before we start.

1) Confirmed targets
- You said you want to work on A (thesis clarity & strength) and C (sentence-level grammar). Good — we’ll fix the thesis first, then focus on grammar as we move into a paragraph.

2) Quick diagnosis of your thesis attempt
You wrote:
“Technological change enhances global employment prospects by replacing people in some basic works and creating some new jobs for human,so it will not cause long‑term net unemployment.”

What to fix (brief, actionable):
- Word choice:
  - “replacing people in some basic works” → say “automating routine/basic tasks” or “replacing routine jobs.”
  - “creating some new jobs for human” → “creating new jobs for humans” or “creating demand for new skilled jobs.”
- Grammar & form:
  - Add articles and correct plurals: “for humans,” “some basic jobs.”
  - Add space after the comma: “..., so …”
  - Use parallel, concise phrasing: put the two reasons in a parallel structure.
- Clarity & academic tone:
  - Remove hedges and keep it concise (no “in my opinion”).
  - It helps to preview two clear reasons (that’s what you’ve tried to do — good).

3) Small model you can copy or adapt (fill-in or use directly)
Try a version like one of these frames (you can choose and edit):

- Strong, simple: Technological change enhances global employment prospects by automating routine tasks and creating demand for new skilled jobs, so it will not cause long‑term net unemployment.
- Nuanced (if you want to show limits): While technology eliminates some routine jobs, it ultimately improves overall employment prospects by automating routine tasks and creating demand for new skilled roles.

I’m giving these as models you can adopt or modify — please try to rewrite your thesis now (either pick one of the two above or make a small change). After you paste the revised thesis, I’ll make focused grammar/pronunciation corrections and confirm it’s ready.

4) Which paragraph shall we revise next?
You originally said A+B, but in our step-by-step process we must pick ONE body paragraph for Step 2 and 3. Which would you like to work on now?
- Paragraph A (first body paragraph): about freeing people from basic tasks so they can do creative/innovative work (AI in marketing example).
- Paragraph B (second body paragraph): about technology needing human oversight, which creates monitoring/maintenance jobs.

My recommendation: Start with Paragraph A — it’s your first example and can connect tightly to the thesis (automation → creative work). But choose whichever you prefer.

Next small steps for you
1. Paste your revised thesis (or say “use the first model above”).
2. Tell me which paragraph to focus on (A or B).

Would you like to try revising the thesis now?

**You:** 1.Although there are some people who argue that technological shift ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term, while as far as I am concerned, this technological shift ultimately enhance it by replacing people in some basic works and creating some new jobs for human,so it will not cause long‑term net unemployment.
2.B

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:26:30.491Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — thanks for trying a new thesis and for choosing paragraph B. I’ll focus on thesis A (clarity & strength) and sentence-level grammar C, as we agreed.

Quick feedback on your thesis attempt (what to fix)
- Remove hedges/redundancy (“Although… while as far as I am concerned” is wordy and confusing).
- Use parallel, clear phrasing for the two reasons (both reasons should be expressed the same way).
- Correct word choice: “basic works” → “routine/basic tasks” or “routine jobs”; “jobs for human” → “jobs for humans”; “employee prospective” → “employment prospects.”
- Fix punctuation/spacing (space after commas) and verb agreement.

I’ve taken your thesis idea and corrected it to be clear, direct, and preview two reasons. Below is the full essay with only the thesis sentence revised (I left the rest of the draft as you wrote it so we can focus on the thesis first).

Full revised text (thesis corrected; other paragraphs unchanged)

Recently the technological shift ultimately improve or destory global employment prospects in the long term is an ongoing debate. While some argue that technological change will reduce job opportunities, I disagree: technological change enhances global employment prospects by automating routine tasks—freeing workers for more creative and skilled roles—and by creating demand for new jobs in monitoring, maintenance, and services; therefore, it will not cause long‑term net unemployment.
First of all, While technology eliminates some routine jobs, it ultimately improves overall employment prospects by automating routine tasks and creating demand for new skilled roles.For example, like Marketing, with AI's assistence, company could employ more employee for creative marketing strategy inside of basic directly marketing and personal saleing.
Second,it is not enough for technology like robot,Internet,AI truly replaced people in some areas, but it's not enough so far.Technology might produce some mistakes if they lack of human's monitor.For example,If Mechine Learning system produce outputs based on wrong or bias data, it may harm for people to use.In some extent, it may lead to AI minic people's situation.In that case, company need to hire some employees to monitor technology work to ensure it's correct outputs. So, even though technology replace some job opportunities for human. At the same time ,it also create new jobs for humans.
Technology technology will not only fail to undermine global employee prospective, but will also enhance global employment prospects in a more faster speed.

Are you happy with this thesis sentence? If yes, we’ll move to Step 2 (topic sentence revision) for paragraph B.

Next step (choose one)
- If you want me to use the second body paragraph already in your draft as paragraph B, say “Use my paragraph B” and confirm you’re ready.
- Or paste the exact paragraph B you want us to work on (topic sentence + all supporting sentences). We need the whole paragraph to continue.

When you paste paragraph B, I’ll ask you to share the current topic sentence, give quick feedback on how well it connects to the new thesis, and invite you to try a revised topic sentence. Would you like to proceed?

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:27:09.929Z

**You:** i don't think i need to revise again cause i concluded others' opinion in this sentence

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:29:44.649Z

**Assistant:** I hear you — you feel your thesis already includes others’ opinion and doesn’t need another revision. That’s a fair instinct. Quick note before we move on: a strong thesis should still clearly state your own position and, ideally, give a brief preview of the reasons you’ll use. Summarising others’ view is fine, but the thesis must also make your stance and the essay’s direction obvious to the reader.

Two quick options — pick one so we can continue:

Option 1 — Proceed now to Step 2 (topic sentence + paragraph revision)
- I’ll accept your current thesis as-is and we’ll move on to revising Paragraph B.
- If you choose this, please paste the exact sentence you want me to treat as the thesis (so we both work from the same line), and paste the full body paragraph B you want to revise. I’ll then ask about the topic sentence and guide you to improve it.

Option 2 — One short, optional tweak to the thesis first
- If you’re open to a very small change that makes your position clearer (not a full rewrite), say so and I’ll suggest a brief edit pattern you can accept or reject. This takes one quick step and will make it easier to link topic sentences to the thesis.

Which would you like — Option 1 (keep thesis, move to paragraph B) or Option 2 (tiny tweak first)? If Option 1, please paste the thesis sentence you’re using and the full paragraph B. If Option 2, tell me and I’ll offer a single short suggestion you can accept or reject.

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:30:00.938Z

**You:** Yeah, thank you so much then we need move to Revise the rest of the essay

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:33:43.370Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for the push to keep moving. A quick note before we begin: I can’t rewrite the whole essay in this single step because our agreed workflow limits us to three things only: (1) the thesis, (2) one body paragraph’s topic sentence, and (3) revising that paragraph’s supporting sentences. We’ll do those well now, and you can repeat the process for other paragraphs later.

Two quick checks so we start from the same place
1) Thesis to use for linking topic sentences: I’ll use the clear thesis I suggested earlier unless you want a different one. Here it is — please confirm or paste your preferred thesis:
- Technological change enhances global employment prospects by automating routine tasks and creating demand for new skilled jobs, so it will not cause long‑term net unemployment.

2) Which paragraph do you want us to revise now? Pick one:
- Paragraph A (first body paragraph): idea = automation frees workers for creative/innovative work (marketing example).
- Paragraph B (second body paragraph): idea = technology requires human monitoring/maintenance, creating jobs.

Tell me:
- Confirm the thesis above (or paste a different one).
- Choose paragraph A or B, and paste the full text of that paragraph (topic sentence plus all supporting sentences) so I can see exactly what we’re working with.

Next step (after you paste)
- I’ll ask you to paste the current topic sentence from that paragraph and then try a short revision yourself (I’ll give quick correction hints and one or two model frames you can adapt). Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now after you paste the paragraph?

Ready when you are — paste the paragraph and your chosen thesis confirmation.

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:34:00.451Z

**You:** Technology technology will not only fail to undermine global employee prospective, but will also enhance global employment prospects in a more faster speed.____that's the end of my passage can you help me to revise it ?Thanks

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:36:19.843Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I can help. Quick check first so we work on what matters most.

1) Targets — confirm please
- Earlier you chose: A = thesis clarity & strength, and C = sentence‑level grammar. Is that still what you want to focus on? (Yes / No — if No, say which two.)

2) Very short diagnosis (based on your final sentence and the essay overall)
- Strengths: clear overall position — you mean to say technology will not cause long‑term unemployment.
- Main problems to fix now: repetition (“Technology technology”), word choice (“employee prospective” → employment prospects), awkward phrasing/parallelism, and an ungrammatical adverb phrase (“in a more faster speed”). Also the thesis should preview 1–2 reasons so readers know your essay’s structure.

Once you confirm A and C, we’ll do Step 1: thesis revision.

Step 1 (thesis work) — your current sentence
You pasted: “Technology technology will not only fail to undermine global employee prospective, but will also enhance global employment prospects in a more faster speed.”

What to fix (quick, actionable)
- Remove the duplicate word “Technology technology.”
- Use “employment prospects” (noun phrase).
- Use parallel verbs and simpler construction: e.g., “will not undermine … but will enhance …”
- Replace “in a more faster speed” with “more quickly” or “at a faster rate.”
- Add 1–2 brief reasons to preview the paragraph topics (for example: “by automating routine tasks and creating demand for new skilled jobs”).

Would you like to try rewriting it now? Try one of these short frames and fill the blanks with your two reasons (keep each reason short):

- Frame 1 (strong): “I disagree that technological change will cause long‑term job losses; instead, it will increase employment by ______ and ______.”
- Frame 2 (nuanced): “While technology eliminates some routine jobs, it ultimately improves employment prospects by ______ and ______.”
- Frame 3 (concise): “Technological change enhances global employment prospects by ______ and ______, so it will not cause long‑term net unemployment.”

Try writing one sentence using a frame above and paste it here. I’ll give focused grammar tweaks and then, once you’re happy, we’ll move to Step 2 (choose which paragraph to revise). If you prefer, type “Suggest” and I’ll propose one corrected version for you to accept or edit. Which do you prefer?

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:36:41.939Z

**You:** ?this is step4 ,
We have already finish step123

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:40:09.046Z

**Assistant:** Great — well done getting through Steps 1–3. That’s progress worth celebrating.

Quick check so we’re on the same page
- Do you mean you’ve finished Step 1 (thesis), Step 2 (topic sentence), and Step 3 (that paragraph’s revision) and now want to do more? Or do you mean you want me to confirm and accept your finished work? Either way is fine — tell me which.

Before we move on, pick one clear next action (choose one):
1) Repeat the three-step cycle for another body paragraph (we’ll negotiate targets again and then do thesis/topic sentence/paragraph for the next paragraph). If this, say: “Repeat for paragraph A” or “Repeat for paragraph B,” and paste that paragraph’s current text.
2) Focus on sentence-level grammar for the whole essay (you previously chose grammar as a target). Note: I’ll still follow our scope by working paragraph-by-paragraph — so tell me which paragraph to start with and paste it.
3) Final proofreading / polish of the whole essay (I can give high‑level suggestions, but full rewriting beyond the three-step scope will need your permission). If you pick this, tell me exactly what you want me to change (e.g., fix all grammar, improve word choice, make it exam-ready).
4) Confirm that you’re finished and want feedback on readiness (I’ll give a short checklist and one final suggestion).

A couple of quick notes to guide your choice
- If you want more improvement, I recommend repeating the three-step process for one more paragraph (option 1). That keeps revisions focused and manageable.
- If you want global grammar fixes, we can start with one paragraph now and continue in further cycles (option 2).

What I need from you now
- Tell me which option you choose (1, 2, 3, or 4).
- If option 1 or 2: paste the full paragraph you want us to work on (topic sentence + supporting sentences).
- If option 3: tell me whether you want small edits or a full polish.
- If option 4: say “ready to submit” and I’ll give a short readiness checklist.

Would you like to continue with another revision cycle for paragraph A or B, or pick a different option?

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:40:27.116Z

**You:** ready to submit

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:41:13.964Z

**Assistant:** Nice — thanks for working through this process. Quick recap before I give the final text.

Confirmed targets and what I changed
- Targets you chose earlier: A = thesis clarity & strength, and C = sentence‑level grammar.
- Following our agreement, I revised:
  1) the thesis sentence (clear, confident, previews two reasons), and
  2) the second body paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences) to improve clarity, unity, and grammar.
- I did not revise other paragraphs (scope we agreed on).

Brief diagnostic note (final check)
- Strengths kept: clear stance: you argue technology will not cause long‑term net unemployment.
- Remaining issues (outside this cycle): some sentences in paragraph one and the conclusion still have grammar and word‑choice problems. If you want, we can run another focused cycle to polish those.

Below is the full essay with the thesis and paragraph B updated. I left the rest of your original draft as we agreed so you can see the targeted changes clearly.

Full revised essay (thesis + paragraph B revised)

Recently the technological shift ultimately improve or destory global employment prospects in the long term is an ongoing debate. While some argue that technological change will reduce job opportunities, I disagree: technological change enhances global employment prospects by automating routine tasks—freeing workers for more creative and skilled roles—and by creating demand for new jobs in monitoring, maintenance, and services; therefore, it will not cause long‑term net unemployment.

First of all, While technology eliminates some routine jobs, it ultimately improves overall employment prospects by automating routine tasks and creating demand for new skilled roles.For example, like Marketing, with AI's assistence, company could employ more employee for creative marketing strategy inside of basic directly marketing and personal saleing.

Second, technology does not completely replace human workers because automated systems need human oversight, maintenance, and correction; this requirement creates new employment opportunities. Machine‑learning systems and other automated tools can produce biased or incorrect outputs when they are trained on flawed data or used without supervision. In those cases, companies must hire people to check results, correct errors, and improve models — roles such as data auditors, quality‑control staff, and customer‑support specialists. Therefore, while some routine tasks may disappear, technology also generates new jobs that depend on human judgment and skills.

Technology will not only fail to undermine global employee prospective, but will also enhance global employment prospects in a more faster speed.

Quick submission checklist (2–3 final items)
- Confirm the thesis: does the revised thesis state your position and the two main reasons you’ll develop? If yes, good to go.
- Read paragraph A and the conclusion once more for grammar and word choice errors (we did not revise them in this cycle). If you want, we can do one more quick pass to fix those sentences so the whole essay reads consistently.
- Check your examples: if you can add one brief concrete detail (e.g., a short example company or a clear result), that strengthens the evidence.

Would you like me to
- A) run a final grammar pass on the whole essay (I’ll still follow cycles — we could do paragraph A next), or
- B) leave this as your final submission?

Either answer is fine — you’ve made real progress. If you choose A, tell me which paragraph to revise next (A or conclusion), and we’ll repeat the three‑step cycle. If you choose B, great — congratulations; I can give a one‑sentence readiness comment.

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:41:54.874Z

**You:** Can you help me to revise my last paragraph?

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:44:20.453Z

**Assistant:** Yes — I can help. Quick clarification first so I follow the right process.

1) Which paragraph do you mean by “last paragraph”?
- Do you mean the concluding paragraph (the short final sentence that repeats your claim), or the last body paragraph (the paragraph about monitoring/maintenance)? Please paste the paragraph here so I work with the exact text.

2) Targets — what would you like to focus on? (Pick up to two)
- clarity of argument / stronger thesis
- paragraph structure / coherence (topic sentence + unity)
- sentence‑level grammar (articles, verb forms, word order)
- vocabulary / naturalness
- evidence / example development
- exam-style score improvement

Tell me which one or two you want to prioritize.

3) Brief diagnostic feedback (based on your essay so far)
- Thesis & Argument
  - Strength: you have a clear position — technology will not cause long‑term net unemployment.
  - Needs work: the thesis wording is awkward and doesn’t clearly preview the reasons; it repeats and uses nonstandard phrasing.

- Organization
  - Strength: basic essay structure is present.
  - Needs work: topic sentences are weak and links between thesis → topic sentences → supporting details are not always clear.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strength: you attempt relevant examples (AI in marketing, monitoring systems).
  - Needs work: examples are vague and need clearer explanation of how they create jobs.

- Language Use
  - Strength: you use some academic vocabulary.
  - Needs work: many grammar errors (duplication, spelling, articles, plural/singular forms), awkward collocations, and punctuation/spacing problems that make meaning unclear.

4) Student priority selection
Which of the diagnosed issues above do you want us to work on now? (Pick up to two — for example “paragraph structure and grammar” or “thesis and evidence”)

5) Next step after you confirm
- If you choose thesis as one target, I’ll ask you to paste your current thesis sentence (or say “use the final sentence in my draft”), and I’ll guide you to revise it (Step 1).
- If you choose a paragraph (structure/coherence or grammar), paste the full paragraph you want to work on (topic sentence + supporting sentences). We’ll then:
  - Step 1: revise thesis (required before topic sentences),
  - Step 2: improve the paragraph’s topic sentence,
  - Step 3: revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity, unity, and grammar.

Important note about scope
- I must follow our three-step workflow: revise the thesis, then one body paragraph’s topic sentence, then that paragraph’s content. I cannot directly revise the conclusion paragraph within this cycle. If by “last paragraph” you mean the concluding sentence, we can either:
  - treat the final body paragraph (the paragraph that supports your conclusion) as the chosen paragraph to improve, or
  - run another cycle afterward that focuses on the conclusion (after we finish thesis + one paragraph now).

Tell me:
1) Which paragraph you mean (paste it),
2) Which one or two targets you choose,
3) Whether you want to keep your current thesis or revise it (paste it or say “use the final sentence in my draft”).

Once you give those, we’ll start Step 1. Would you like to proceed?

**You:** In my opinion, technology not only will not undermine global employee prospective ,but also enhance global employment prospects in amore faster speed.-----this one

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:49:20.916Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a good moment to organize our work so the session is efficient and helpful.

First, quick goal check (one short answer)
- Which of these are your personal goals for this essay? Pick any you want and up to two as our session focus:
  - clarity of argument
  - stronger thesis
  - paragraph structure/coherence
  - sentence‑level grammar
  - vocabulary / naturalness
  - better examples / evidence
  - exam‑style score improvement

Tell me which two you want to focus on (for example: “stronger thesis and sentence‑level grammar”).

Diagnostic feedback (short, rubric‑based)
I reviewed your draft and the thesis you pasted. Brief diagnosis using the four rubric categories — strengths first, then what to improve:

- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: You take a clear position — you disagree that technology will cause long‑term job loss.
  - Needs work: The sentence is grammatically weak and hard to read; it doesn’t clearly preview the reasons you will use. Remove hedges and fix parallel verbs.

- Organization
  - Strengths: Essay has intro, body paragraphs, and a closing idea.
  - Needs work: Topic sentences and transitions are weak; paragraphs need clearer links back to a stronger thesis.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: You use relevant examples (AI in marketing; monitoring/maintenance).
  - Needs work: Examples are vague and need clearer explanation of how they create jobs (mechanism and brief detail).

- Language Use (grammar, word choice, spelling)
  - Strengths: You try to use academic vocabulary (e.g., “technological shift”).
  - Needs work: Many grammar errors (articles, verb forms, plurals), misspellings, duplicated words (“Technology technology”), and awkward phrases (“in a more faster speed”) that obscure meaning.

My recommendation (two priorities)
- I suggest focusing on: A = stronger thesis (needed first) and C = sentence‑level grammar & vocabulary. Fixing the thesis makes the rest easier; clearer grammar will make your revisions readable.

Student priority selection
- Which issues from the diagnosis do you want to focus on now? (Pick up to two from the list above; e.g., “A and C” or “A and B”.)
- Also confirm: do you want me to start Step 1 using the thesis you pasted:  
  “In my opinion, technology not only will not undermine global employee prospective ,but also enhance global employment prospects in amore faster speed.”  
  (If you prefer a slightly different sentence as the starting point, paste it now.)

Once you confirm the two targets and confirm which thesis sentence to use, we’ll begin Step 1 (thesis revision). Would you like to proceed?

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:49:47.729Z

**You:** stronger thesis and sentence‑level grammar

*Time:* 2025-11-21T02:50:32.060Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming your targets: stronger thesis and sentence‑level grammar. Let’s start Step 1.

Please paste the exact thesis sentence you want to revise (or say “use the final sentence in my draft” if you want me to work from that).  

Before you paste, a very quick checklist of what I’ll look for and fix:
- Clear, confident position (no “In my opinion” hedging).
- Direct answer to the prompt’s “to what extent” (e.g., disagree / partly disagree).
- One or two brief reasons previewed (so your body paragraphs can link back).
- Correct grammar: parallel verbs, correct noun phrase “employment prospects,” and natural adverb phrasing (e.g., “at a faster rate” or “more quickly”).

When you paste your thesis, try rewriting it yourself first. If you’d like a sentence frame to help, pick one of these and fill the blanks with your two reasons (e.g., “automating routine tasks,” “creating demand for new skilled jobs,” “requiring human oversight and maintenance”):

- Frame 1 (strong): “I disagree that technological change will cause long‑term job losses; instead, it will increase employment by ___ and ___.”
- Frame 2 (nuanced): “While technology eliminates some routine jobs, it ultimately improves employment prospects by ___ and ___.”
- Frame 3 (concise): “Technological change enhances global employment prospects by ___ and ___, so it will not cause long‑term net unemployment.”

Would you like to try one now? Paste your attempt and I’ll give quick, focused grammar and clarity edits.
