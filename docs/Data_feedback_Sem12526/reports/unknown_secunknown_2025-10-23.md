## 1) Student's Original Essay and Question

**Question:**  
*The international community should act immediately to ensure that all countries reduce their consumption of fossil fuels, such as gas and oil. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Write at least 250 words.*

**Student’s Essay:**  
Some people feel it an urge for international communities to implement immediate policies to reduce the usage of fossil fuels worldwide. Considering the pollution they have contributed to the globe, I partially agree with that. However, I think there’s no need for every country to decrease the consumption sharply, especially for developing countries.

Apparently, fossil fuels have contaminated our earth severely. Carbon dioxide produced during the process of burning gas results in climate change whereas marine habitats were ruined due to the leakage of petroleum, not to mention the indirect negative impacts attributed to the process of exploiting non-renewables. For example, the frequency of regional earthquakes was led by the well drilling procedure in fracking—an effective way to obtain underground oil. It’s the duty for every human-being worldwide to intercept continuous pollution as soon as possible, that’s why international communities should conduct specified strategies to ensure it works effectively.

Nonetheless, things can be different when speaking of developing countries. Given that non-renewable fuels remain the dominant energy resource, it proves difficult for them to totally steer clear of those conventional power supplies. Someone may dispute that alternative energy can be a substitute. But it is hardly feasible at present for the lack in its popularization and deficiency of tech maturity. For instance, China constitutes a significant portion of solar power generation globally, yet its capacity factor is staggeringly low due to the transmitting deficit. Thus, fossil fuels consumption restriction should be thought twice when being carried out on the developing countries. Otherwise, their energy security and independence might not be guaranteed.

## 2) Detailed Feedback on IELTS Criteria

### 🎯 Task Response (TR)  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Addresses the question by discussing the need for international action on fossil fuels.  
  - Presents a balanced view acknowledging both environmental concerns and economic realities for developing countries.  
- **Areas for Improvement:**  
  - The position is somewhat implied but should be stated more explicitly and early in the essay (e.g., clear thesis statement).  
  - The conclusion could better reinforce the stance taken.  
  - Some ideas could be more fully developed with clearer explanations.

### 🔗 Coherence & Cohesion (CC)  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Paragraphing is logical: introduction, environmental impact, developing countries’ challenges.  
  - Examples are relevant and support points.  
- **Areas for Improvement:**  
  - Transitions between sentences and paragraphs can be smoother with more varied linking words (e.g., moreover, however, therefore).  
  - Some sentences are long and could be split for clarity.  
  - Minor punctuation issues affect flow.

### 📚 Lexical Resource (LR)  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Uses some topic-specific vocabulary (e.g., “carbon dioxide,” “fracking,” “capacity factor”).  
  - Attempts to use academic language and formal tone.  
- **Areas for Improvement:**  
  - Occasional awkward word choices and collocations (“intercept continuous pollution,” “thought twice when being carried out”).  
  - Repetition of words like “fossil fuels” could be reduced with synonyms or pronouns.  
  - Some phrases are unclear or unnatural; work on precise and idiomatic expressions.

### ⚙️ Grammatical Range & Accuracy (GRA)

## 3) Band 6.0 Model Answer Provided

The international community should indeed consider immediate policies to reduce fossil fuel consumption worldwide. I partially agree with this statement due to the environmental pollution caused by fossil fuels, but I believe that a sharp reduction may not be feasible for every country, particularly developing ones.

Fossil fuels have severely contaminated our planet. The carbon dioxide emitted from burning these fuels contributes significantly to climate change, while petroleum leaks have devastated marine habitats. Additionally, the extraction processes for non-renewable resources, such as fracking, have led to regional earthquakes. It is the responsibility of all nations to curb pollution promptly, and international communities must implement effective strategies to address this issue.

However, the situation is different for developing countries. Non-renewable fuels are still the primary energy source, making it challenging for these countries to entirely abandon conventional energy supplies. Although some argue that alternative energy sources can replace fossil fuels, the current lack of widespread adoption and technological maturity makes this difficult. For instance, China is a leading producer of solar power, yet its capacity is limited by transmission deficits. Therefore, restrictions on fossil fuel consumption must be carefully considered in developing countries to ensure their energy security and independence.

In conclusion, while reducing fossil fuel consumption is essential, the approach must be balanced to accommodate the unique needs of developing nations. International cooperation is crucial to achieve sustainable energy transitions globally.

### Model Answer Generation

📝 **Revised Band 6.0 Model Answer Based on Your Ideas**

The international community should indeed take immediate action to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels, such as gas and oil, across all countries. I agree with this statement to a large extent because of the environmental and economic benefits it would bring.

Firstly, reducing fossil fuel consumption is crucial for mitigating climate change. The burning of fossil fuels releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. By decreasing reliance on these energy sources, countries can lower their carbon emissions, thus helping to prevent the adverse effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels and extreme weather events.

Secondly, transitioning to alternative energy sources can lead to economic advantages. Renewable energy industries, such as wind and solar power, are rapidly growing and creating numerous job opportunities. Countries that invest in these industries can benefit from economic growth and increased employment rates. Additionally, reducing dependency on fossil fuels can enhance energy security, as countries will be less vulnerable to fluctuations in oil and gas prices.

However, it is important to note that the transition to alternative energy sources requires significant investment and infrastructure development. Some countries may face challenges in implementing these changes due to financial constraints. Therefore, international cooperation and support are essential to ensure that all nations can participate in this global effort.

In conclusion, while there are challenges to reducing fossil fuel consumption, the environmental and economic benefits make it a necessary step. The international community must act collectively to support this transition for a sustainable future.

✨ **Key Improvements Summary:**
- ✨ Enhanced Thesis Statement: Made the position clearer.
- ✨ Improved Cohesion: Added linking words for better flow.
- ✨ Upgraded Vocabulary: Replaced basic terms with more academic ones.
