            ## Contribution Analysis

            Certainly! Based on the chat history and the assessment report, here is a suggested next step to support the student in completing the required revision task for the thesis statement:

**Suggested Prompt to Encourage Thesis Revision**

Thank you for sharing your thesis statement earlier. Now, let's take the next step and try revising it together. Here’s a simple template you can follow to make your position clearer and preview your essay’s structure:

*"While individual actions alone cannot solve climate change, I believe that citizens play a crucial role by influencing government policies, and that personal lifestyle choices, though less impactful, also contribute to addressing the problem."*

You can use this as a model or write your own. Try to be confident and clear about the two main points your essay will discuss:

1. How individuals influence government actions  
2. How personal green lifestyle choices matter as well

Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now? Please share your new version when ready, and I will provide feedback to help you improve it further.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

**Assistant:** Great! Thank you for sharing your current thesis statement:

> I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

Let's start revising your thesis together. Here are some points to consider:

**Strengths:**  
- You make your position clear (“partly agree”).  
- You mention two main ideas: influencing government, and personal lifestyle choices.

**Suggestions for improvement:**  
- Be even clearer about your viewpoint: What do you think is most important?  
- Try to preview the structure of your essay in the thesis—hint at both main points.  
- Use direct language (avoid “I think,” “I believe,” or “at the same time, I also think”).  
- Try to avoid saying “partly agree”—be specific about your stance.  
- Combine your main ideas confidently in one sentence.

**Guiding Questions:**  
- How can you show, in one clear sentence, that individuals DO have a role, but it’s mainly through influencing government, while personal choices are also helpful but less powerful?

**Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now, based on this feedback?**  
Take your time! If you want, you can write several options, and I can help you choose the strongest one.
