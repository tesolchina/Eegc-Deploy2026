            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your current progress and the chat history.

Based on the detailed assessment and interaction history, here is a comprehensive summary and tailored recommendations to help you successfully complete the revision and improve your essay writing skills:

---

## Summary of Current Status

- **Original essay:** Solid foundation in content and idea development but issues with informal style, grammar, and specificity.
- **Revised essay:** Contains placeholders instead of actual revisions. Key revision steps of rewriting the thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph sentences were not completed.
- **AI-assistant interaction:** Well-intentioned guidance was provided step-by-step, but actual text revisions were replaced by “pretend” responses, which prevented iterative improvement.
- **Overall:** Conceptual understanding is present, but practical execution of revisions is missing.

---

## Core Areas to Address

### 1. Submit Actual Revised Text

You need to provide concrete sentence revisions for the thesis, topic sentence, and body paragraph sentences. This is essential to receive precise, targeted feedback and to practice writing improved academic sentences.

**Action:**  
- Rewrite the thesis statement incorporating a confident stance and preview of two main points.  
- Revise the topic sentence of paragraph 1 to clearly state the main idea with mechanisms and outcomes.  
- Rewrite individual sentences of paragraph 1 using the detailed prompts provided.

Share your revisions here as sentences or as a revised paragraph.

---

### 2. Follow the Revision Sequence

The assistant’s step-by-step process requires completing each stage before moving on.

**Required order:**  
1. Thesis statement — clear and previewing main points.  
2. Topic sentence for paragraph 1 — explicit and aligned to thesis.  
3. Full paragraph 1 revision — incorporating specific examples, refined vocabulary, grammar, and cohesion.

Focus on mastering each step in turn for effective writing and revision skills.

---

### 3. Enhance Formality and Specificity

- Replace informal words/phrases (e.g., "normal people" → "ordinary citizens").  
- Use formal connectors/transitions (e.g., “However,” “Consequently”).  
- Add concrete, factual examples (e.g., “In 2015, Rwanda implemented a plastic bag ban following citizen advocacy,” or “Public pressure in Germany led to increased renewable energy investment”).

---

### 4. Improve Grammar and Style

- Correct grammar errors (e.g., “nothing happen” → “nothing happens”).  
- Use varied sentence structures with clear cause-effect relationships.  
- Avoid hedging phrases (“I think,” “maybe”); instead, state your position confidently.

---

### 5. Practice Critical Engagement with AI Suggestions

When given multiple ways to revise, choose one and explain your reasoning if possible. For example, explain why you prefer “pressured” to “forced” or why you add a specific example.

---

## Sample Thesis Revision Scaffold

Here is a scaffold you can adapt:

> “I partly agree that individual actions alone are insufficient to solve climate change; however, collective citizen influence on government policy and widespread personal lifestyle changes both play important roles in driving environmental progress.”

Share your version based on this scaffold or your own ideas.

---

## Next Steps for You

1. **Submit your revised thesis statement here.**  
Feel free to use the scaffold or your own formulation, but make it clear, confident, and preview your essay’s two main points.

2. **Confirm your paragraph 1 topic sentence, or share your revision of it.**

3. **Choose one sentence in the body of paragraph 1 to revise according to the assistant’s prompt and paste it here.**

Once you provide these, I will give step-by-step, focused feedback on each sentence and assist you with polishing the paragraph.

---

Please consider this a supportive environment to practice your academic writing and revision skills thoroughly. Submitting actual revised text will unlock the full benefit of AI-guided iterative feedback.

I look forward to your revised thesis statement to get started!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The essay presents a clear, relevant position ("I partly agree") and develops two main ideas (citizen influence on government; individual green choices). Examples and the recognition of limitations strengthen the argument, but ideas are sometimes general and would benefit from more concrete evidence (no named campaigns, countries, or statistics).
- Organization: 20/25 - The essay has an expected structure (introduction, two body paragraphs, conclusion) and logical progression. However, some sentences lack cohesion and transitions could be stronger to improve flow between claims and counterpoints.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary is adequate and generally appropriate for the topic, but often informal ("normal people," "big effect") and repetitive. There is limited use of precise, topic-specific terminology (e.g., "advocacy," "carbon targets," "policy" are used unevenly).
- Grammar: 16/25 - Frequent grammar and phrasing errors (e.g., "maybe just listen a little," "so nothing happen") affect clarity. Sentence structure is mostly simple with some awkward constructions that reduce academic tone.
- **Original Essay Total: 75/100**

Evidence from original essay:
- Clear thesis statement: "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."
- Informal phrasing and errors: "normal people," "But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well."

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 16/25 - The revised file contains placeholders and no substantive changes to the thesis or key topic sentence. The intended improvements are described as "bla bla bla" and "(revised thesis statement here)," so the essay lacks the actual revisions that would show improved idea clarity or evidence.
- Organization: 15/25 - Structure remains largely the same, but placeholders interrupt coherence. Because core sentences (thesis and topic sentence) were not actually revised, the organization is effectively incomplete.
- Vocabulary: 16/25 - No meaningful vocabulary improvement is visible; placeholders and unchanged informal phrases persist ("let’s pretend we have revised topic sentence bla bla bla...").
- Grammar: 14/25 - Grammatical issues from the original remain in the unrevised portions, and additional placeholder text makes the draft incomplete and unsuitable for final assessment.
- **Revised Essay Total: 61/100**

Evidence from revised essay:
- Placeholder instead of revision: "bla bla bla...... (revised thesis statement here)"
- Pretend topic sentence and body: "let’s pretend we have revised topic sentence bla bla bla..." and "let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on         bla bla bla..."

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -14 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Student engaged in the revision process conceptually (acknowledged the assistant's checklist and scaffolds).
  - The student maintained the original essay's logical structure.
  - The student demonstrated understanding of what should be revised (per chat guidance), even though changes were not applied.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The thesis statement was not actually rewritten despite multiple prompts — inserting an explicit, concise thesis previewing the two main points would improve clarity and force.
  - The topic sentence for paragraph 1 was not revised; it could be tightened to make the mechanism and result explicit (e.g., "Collective citizen action through voting and advocacy can prompt governments to adopt stronger environmental policies").
  - The body paragraph was not revised; opportunities to add concrete examples (specific countries, campaigns, laws) and to replace informal phrasing were missed.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9** (assistant and student messages combined)
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided structured, pedagogical guidance (explicit checklists, sentence-level prompts, scaffolds for thesis and topic sentence). The student engaged but repeatedly avoided producing the required revisions, responding with "let's pretend..." instead of submitting actual drafts. This limited the opportunity for iterative feedback and prevented completion of the required tasks.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Developing. The conversation includes multiple relevant turns and useful guidance from the assistant. However, the total number of exchanges is moderate (9), and the student did not provide the substantive outputs necessary for deeper iterative work.
  - Evidence: Assistant provided multi-step guidance and templates; student replied but did not supply actual revised sentences (e.g., "let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on         bla bla bla...").
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - Basic. The student accepted the assistant's directions superficially but did not demonstrate critical evaluation or selective acceptance/rejection of suggestions.
  - Evidence: Student repeatedly followed the assistant's prompts by "pretending" to revise instead of testing options or asking follow-up critical questions (no examples of "I prefer X because..." or "I disagree with suggestion Y because...").
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - Basic. There is minimal iteration of drafting and revision. The assistant requested a revised thesis and topic sentence before paragraph edits; the student did not provide them, so no genuine revision cycle occurred.
  - Evidence: Assistant: "Please paste your revised thesis statement here." Student: "let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on..."

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Student shows conceptual understanding of revision needs (acknowledged assistant checklists and scaffolds in chat).
- The original essay displays a coherent position and recognition of counterpoints and limitations.
- The student engaged with the assistant and followed structured prompts rather than ignoring guidance entirely.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Provide actual revised text when requested (thesis, topic sentence, and revised paragraph) so the assistant can give targeted, iterative feedback.
- Replace informal or vague phrases with precise academic language (e.g., "ordinary citizens," "policy response," "consumer demand").
- Use concrete evidence and examples (named policies, countries, campaigns, or statistics) to substantiate claims about how citizen action leads to policy change.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the original essay and responded to prompts, enabling the assistant to give tailored guidance. However, the student did not supply revised versions to complete the cycle.
  - Evidence: Original draft was shared in full; assistant tailored checklists and sentence prompts based on that text.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The student did not follow through on the assistant's required sequence (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) despite clear instructions.
  - Evidence: Assistant repeatedly asked for a revised thesis before paragraph edits; student replied with "let's pretend..." instead of a concrete revision.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - Little evidence the student evaluated or selectively adapted AI suggestions; responses show acceptance without testing or critique.
  - Evidence: No instances of the student discussing which AI suggestions they preferred or why.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The student did not perform the mandatory textual revisions; independent edits are absent from the chat and revised file.
  - Evidence: Revised essay contains placeholders rather than rewritten thesis/topic sentence/body paragraph.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Submit concrete revisions when requested. Begin by posting one revised sentence (the thesis) and request line-by-line feedback; this allows true iterative improvement.
2. Follow the assistant's required sequence (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) so each revision builds on the previous one; use the assistant's scaffolds but personalize wording and add specific evidence.
3. Practice critical evaluation of AI suggestions: when offered alternatives, state a preference and justify it (e.g., "I prefer option A because it is more formal," or "I want to include a real example: the UK's plastic bag charge (2015)").

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student engaged with the AI and understands the revision framework, but did not complete the mandatory revision tasks (thesis rewrite, topic sentence revision, and paragraph revision). The revised submission contains placeholders and therefore cannot be fully assessed as a completed revision.
- Action required: Ask the student to resubmit with an actual revised thesis statement, a revised topic sentence for paragraph 1 (or confirmation they wish to keep it), and a fully revised body paragraph that implements the assistant's sentence-level recommendations. Once the student provides actual text, a more accurate assessment and iterative feedback can be given.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:37:35.458Z

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:10:47.215Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:11:00.858Z

**Assistant:** Great — I see your current thesis:  
"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Step 1 — Feedback on your thesis
- Clarity: The meaning is clear — you partly agree and give two reasons (citizen influence and personal lifestyle choices).  
- Strength and focus: It is a bit wordy and uses weak phrasing ("I believe", "I also think", "while less impactful, still have a role"), which reduces force. For an academic essay, remove personal hedges and make the extent of agreement explicit (e.g., “to a certain extent” or “partly” is fine, but state it confidently).  
- Structure/preview: It would be stronger if it briefly previews the two main points you will develop (how citizens influence governments; how collective individual choices and consumer pressure affect companies and emissions). That preview will help the reader follow your essay.

Checklist for your revision (must meet these before we move on)
- Directly answers the question (states the extent of agreement).
- Briefly previews the main points you will discuss (two or three items).
- Uses confident, concise language (avoid “I think”, “I believe”, “maybe”).

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using that checklist? Paste your revised sentence here, and tell me if you feel satisfied with it. Once you are happy, we’ll move to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:11:13.407Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on         bla bla bla...

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:16:16.243Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s move on, pretending your thesis has been revised and now clearly states the extent of your view and previews the two main points (citizen influence on government; collective individual/consumer actions).

Step 2 — choose a body paragraph
Which paragraph would you like to work on?
- Paragraph 1 (influence on government) — current topic sentence: “The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”
- Paragraph 2 (personal/consumer actions) — current topic sentence: “On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.”

If you’re not sure, I recommend Paragraph 1 because it connects directly to your stronger claim about citizen influence.

Please tell me which paragraph you choose and paste its current topic sentence (or confirm the one above). I’ll give focused feedback on how well it links to your revised thesis and give a short, practical checklist and a fill-in-the-blanks template to help you rewrite the topic sentence. 

Would you like to try revising that sentence now?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:16:28.563Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentence and move on                              bla bla bla…

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:23:45.990Z

**Assistant:** Nice—since we’re pretending your thesis and topic sentence are now revised and approved, we’ll move to Step 3: revising the rest of the chosen paragraph (the one about citizen influence on government). I won’t rewrite any full sentences for you. Instead, I’ll give clear, focused guidance you can use to revise each sentence, plus a short checklist and next steps.

Quick confirmation before we begin
- Are you satisfied with the revised thesis? If not, paste it now and we’ll fix it before continuing.

Checklist for the paragraph (use this as you revise)
- Every sentence clearly supports the topic sentence and links back to the thesis.
- Evidence/examples are specific (name a country, policy, campaign, or outcome if possible).
- Cause-and-effect is explicit: how do citizen actions lead to policy change?
- Language is formal and precise (avoid “maybe,” “just,” “big effect,” “normal people”).
- Grammar and tense are correct; sentences are varied in length and structure.
- Use transition words to show contrast or consequence (e.g., However, For example, Consequently).

Sentence-by-sentence guidance (work from your paragraph’s original sentences)
1) “When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act.”
- Strength: Good claim that links to your thesis.
- Revision tips: Clarify the mechanisms (voting, protests, petitions, lobbying) that convert public demand into policy. Consider adding a phrase that shows the causal link (why governments respond).

2) “For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy.”
- Strength: Good use of “for example.”
- Revision tips: Be more specific—identify a type of protest or an outcome (e.g., a ban, subsidy, or legislation). Replace vague verbs such as “can push” with stronger academic verbs (e.g., “can prompt,” “can lead to”). If you can, name a real campaign or statistic.

3) “In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions.”
- Issues: “forced” is informal and a bit extreme; “plastic” is vague; grammar and register need polish.
- Revision tips: Change to a more academic verb (e.g., “pressured” or “persuaded”), specify the policy (e.g., plastic bag bans, carbon targets), and give a concrete example or country if possible.

4) “This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power.”
- Issues: “normal people,” “big effect” are informal and vague.
- Revision tips: Replace with formal phrasing (“ordinary citizens,” “significant impact”) and explicitly connect this point back to the thesis (e.g., how collective action complements government/industry efforts).

5) “But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well.”
- Errors: Grammar (“maybe” → “may,” “so is not always working well” → “so this influence is not always effective”), awkward phrasing.
- Revision tips: Explain reasons governments might not act decisively (political constraints, industry lobbying, short-term priorities). Use a transition word like “However” or “Nevertheless.”

6) “Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.”
- Errors: Grammar (“nothing happen” → “nothing happens”), informal wording (“tell the politicians”).
- Revision tips: Clarify: many citizens lack access, organization, or knowledge about lobbying; they may not know how to use formal channels (petitions, contacting representatives, joining NGOs). Suggest briefly how this limitation weakens individual influence.

Cohesion and flow
- Use transitions to mark the argument’s direction: e.g., state a positive claim, give evidence, then use “However” to introduce limits.
- End the paragraph with a sentence that explicitly links back to the thesis (e.g., this evidence shows that collective citizen pressure is a meaningful channel for change, though it has limits).

Vocabulary and tone suggestions (single-word or short-phrase hints)
- Replace: “big effect” → “significant impact”
- Replace: “normal people” → “ordinary citizens” or “the public”
- Replace: “maybe just listen a little” → “may respond only partially” (use this as a model to rephrase yourself)
- Replace: “tell the politicians” → “communicate with/pressure elected officials” or “engage in political advocacy”

Next steps
- Would you like to try revising the paragraph now? Paste your revised paragraph and I will give targeted feedback sentence by sentence.
- If you prefer, tell me which single sentence you want help polishing first and I’ll ask guiding questions to help you improve it.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:24:11.902Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1                                  bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:28:13.128Z

**Assistant:** Great — before we revise the rest of paragraph #1, we need to complete Step 1 and Step 2 of the process.

Step 1 — Thesis (mandatory)
Please paste your revised thesis statement here. I gave feedback earlier on how to make it clearer and stronger (state the extent of agreement, preview the two main points, and avoid hedges like “I think”). I cannot continue with paragraph editing until you confirm you are satisfied with a revised thesis. 

If you’d like a quick scaffold instead of a full rewritten sentence, here are two short fill-in-the-blank templates you can use to craft a strong thesis (do not copy them word-for-word; fill in specifics about your view and main points):
- “I partly agree that individual actions are insignificant because, although individual behaviour can collectively influence government policy through [mechanism(s)], major emissions reductions require systemic change by governments and corporations in areas such as [policy/industry area].”
- “To a certain extent, individual actions matter: citizens can pressure governments and shape market demand through [mechanism(s)], but large-scale policy and corporate change remain essential to achieve meaningful emissions cuts.”

Please paste your revised thesis (based on the checklist) and tell me if you are satisfied. Once you confirm, we will move to Step 2.

Step 2 — Topic sentence (required before we revise the paragraph)
You chose paragraph #1 (influence on government). The current topic sentence is:
“The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”

Before I help revise the rest of the paragraph, please either:
- Paste a revised topic sentence you have written that matches your new thesis, OR
- Confirm you want to keep the sentence above and I’ll give guidance on tightening it.

If you want a short scaffold (not a full sentence) to help you revise the topic sentence, use this structure:
- Begin with the role: “Collective citizen action…”
- Add the mechanism: “…through [voting/protests/petitions/advocacy/consumer pressure]…”
- End with the result: “…can prompt governments to adopt [specific policy types or outcomes].”

Step 3 — Revising the rest of paragraph #1 (we will only do this after thesis and topic sentence are set)
When you post the revised thesis and the revised topic sentence (or confirm the original topic sentence), tell me whether you want help with:
- Sentence-by-sentence edits (I will give short revision prompts for each sentence), or
- Reorganising the paragraph (which sentence to move, where to add evidence or a concluding link to the thesis).

To get you started, here are precise, short revision prompts for each sentence in your original paragraph. Use them to rewrite your sentences; paste each new sentence and I will give targeted feedback.

1) Original: “When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act.”
- Prompt: Add the mechanism and reason. Name 1–2 mechanisms (e.g., voting, petitions) and briefly say why governments respond (e.g., electoral pressure, public legitimacy).

2) Original: “For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy.”
- Prompt: Replace vague verbs with stronger academic verbs (e.g., “prompt,” “lead to,” “encourage”) and, if possible, insert a specific, brief example (country, campaign, or policy).

3) Original: “In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions.”
- Prompt: Use a more formal verb (e.g., “pressured” or “persuaded”), name a specific policy (e.g., “plastic bag bans,” “national carbon targets”) and, if you can, give a concrete location (e.g., Rwanda, Kenya, the UK).

4) Original: “This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power.”
- Prompt: Replace informal phrases (“normal people,” “big effect”). Explicitly connect collective pressure to the thesis: explain how collective action complements larger institutional change.

5) Original: “But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well.”
- Prompt: Correct grammar and give 1–2 reasons governments may act weakly (e.g., political constraints, industry lobbying, short election cycles). Use a transition like “However” or “Nevertheless.”

6) Original: “Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.”
- Prompt: Replace informal wording. Explain barriers citizens face (lack of organisation, limited access to decision-makers, low civic knowledge) and connect this to the paragraph’s concluding sentence.

Finishing sentence (closing link to thesis)
- Prompt: End the paragraph with a clear link to your thesis: say that while citizen pressure can produce policy change, it has limits and therefore must be combined with government/corporate action.
