            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your Final Assessment Report and the chat history.

### Summary of Key Points:

- Your revised essay shows strong improvements over the original draft in thesis clarity, paragraph development, vocabulary, and grammar.
- However, the core content focus remained on automation jobs, while the original assignment prompt concerns climate change (individuals vs governments/corporations).
- This mismatch is the biggest issue affecting task response and overall essay effectiveness.
- The chat reveals minimal substantive interaction on AI suggestions; you repeatedly replied with “let pretend we have revised…” rather than engaging actively in the revision process.
- The assistant consistently encouraged you to clarify your goals, focus on the correct prompt, and proceed step-by-step, but these steps were bypassed in the chat.
- Despite this, your offline revisions addressed many language and structure weaknesses independently.

---

### Recommendations for Your Next Steps and Future Success:

1. **Clarify and Align with the Assignment Prompt:**
   - Confirm the exact essay prompt and ensure your thesis and arguments directly respond to it.
   - For example, if the prompt is about climate change and roles of individuals vs governments/corporations, refocus your essay accordingly.
   - This will greatly improve “task response” and the overall coherence of your argument.

2. **Engage Actively in AI-Assisted Revision:**
   - When working with AI or instructors, try to provide specific feedback on suggestions.
   - Accept or reject ideas with reasons, experiment with wording, and ask follow-up questions.
   - This will deepen your learning and generate better revision outcomes in real time.

3. **Use Specific Evidence:**
   - Strengthen your claims by incorporating relevant data, examples, or studies.
   - For example, mention statistics on automation’s impact or cite climate policies if applicable.
   - This adds credibility and depth to your arguments.

4. **Document Your Revision Process:**
   - In future AI sessions, share your draft updates step-by-step.
   - Show how you revised the thesis, topic sentences, or paragraphs.
   - This helps coaches understand your progress and offer precise guidance.

5. **Develop Critical Evaluation Skills:**
   - When you receive feedback or suggestions, analyze how they fit your goals and essay style.
   - This will build your ability to self-edit and improve independently.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The original expresses a clear position (pro-automation jobs) but ideas are underdeveloped and sometimes unclear. Example: "I strongly believe that automation created job opportunities to all of us. In this essay, I will examine the main reasons." The argument lacks broader evidence and nuance.
- Organization: 17/25 - Basic essay structure (intro, body, conclusion) is present, but topic sentences and paragraph unity are weak and transitions are limited. Paragraphs contain idea shifts and unsupported claims.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Limited and sometimes inaccurate word choice (e.g., "low study level person," "hand-on jobs," "refill ... on Timor") that impedes clarity.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Frequent grammar, article, and agreement errors that sometimes obscure meaning (e.g., "automation need a lot of labour"; "labour are required").
- **Original Essay Total: 64/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised thesis is clearer: "While some argue that automation decreases job opportunities for low-skilled workers, I strongly believe that it creates job opportunities overall." The essay now better explains how automation shifts job types and mentions policy/training as solutions. Still, claims remain largely general and would benefit from concrete data or citations.
- Organization: 21/25 - Paragraph structure and logical progression improved. The first body paragraph has a clearer topic sentence and subsequent supporting sentences. The conclusion synthesizes the claim. Some transitions could be smoother between claims and counterargument.
- Vocabulary: 21/25 - Noticeable improvement in word choice and precision (e.g., "manual jobs," "replenish materials," "troubleshoot issues"). A few repetitions remain, but vocabulary is more appropriate to the topic.
- Grammar: 20/25 - Grammar and sentence structure are much improved; sentences are clearer and punctuation is better. Minor stylistic and punctuation issues remain.
- **Revised Essay Total: 83/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +19 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis clarified and made grammatically correct (original: "I strongly believe that automation created job opportunities to all of us." revised: "I strongly believe that it creates job opportunities overall.").
  - Topic sentence and paragraph 1 substantially revised for clarity and development (original: "To begin with, automation need a lot of labour to control and monitor the machines." revised: "To begin with, automation requires a lot of workers to control and monitor machines.").
  - Body paragraph development improved with clearer examples and explanation (revised paragraph adds specifics: "workers are needed to replenish materials, perform maintenance, and ensure quality" and the cake-making example is expanded).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Task response mismatch: the chat assistant repeatedly flagged that the assignment prompt concerns climate change (individuals vs governments/corporations), but the essay remains on automation. If the climate prompt is the required task, the student did not refocus content to address it.
  - Evidence depth: no empirical data, studies, or concrete external examples to substantiate claims about job creation vs. displacement.
  - Greater sophistication in counterargument handling and deeper explanation of long-term labor-market impacts (e.g., scale of jobs created vs. lost, sectoral differences) would strengthen the essay.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 7 messages**
  - Assistant (initial guidance)
  - User: "let pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on bla bla bla…"
  - Assistant (diagnosis & negotiation)
  - User: "let pretend we have revised the topic sentence and move on bla bla bla…"
  - Assistant (reminder & negotiation)
  - User: "let pretend we have revised the body paragraph and move on bla bla bla…"
  - Assistant (follow-up)
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided structured, diagnostic, and actionable guidance (noting the key issue: topic mismatch with the climate prompt) and proposed a three-step revision plan. The student did not engage substantively in the chat: the user repeatedly replied with "let pretend..." rather than negotiating targets, sharing revisions, or asking clarifying questions. Evidence: three user messages that say variations of "let pretend we have revised..." rather than submitting actual interim revisions or responding to prompts.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 - The chat contains several assistant messages with useful guidance but only a small number of user replies and no sustained back-and-forth iteration. The conversation is therefore sparse and lacks depth from the student's side.
  - Evidence: only 7 total messages and the user repeatedly avoids engaging with the proposed revision steps ("let pretend we have revised the thesis/topic sentence/body paragraph").
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 - The student did not critically evaluate or discuss the AI's suggestions in the chat. The user did not accept, reject, or modify suggestions with reasons; instead they avoided the negotiation steps.
  - Evidence: absence of critical responses in the chat; user messages do not address the assistant's diagnostic points (e.g., the important mismatch with the climate prompt).
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - The assistant outlined a clear iterative process (thesis -> topic sentence -> paragraph). However, the chat shows no evidence that the student followed these steps in the conversation itself (they repeatedly "pretend" to have completed steps). That said, a revised essay was submitted, indicating some offline revision occurred. The chat, however, lacks documented iterative cycles.
  - Evidence: assistant's repeated prompts to choose A/B and targets, but no substantive student-led revisions shown in chat.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 5/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear position and intent: both drafts show a consistent thesis defending automation as a net creator of jobs (revised thesis is clearer and grammatically correct).
  - Evidence: Revised thesis: "While some argue that automation decreases job opportunities for low-skilled workers, I strongly believe that it creates job opportunities overall."
- Improved paragraph development and clarity in the revised essay: the first body paragraph now includes specific supporting actions (replenish materials, maintenance, quality control).
  - Evidence: "workers are needed to replenish materials, perform maintenance, and ensure quality."
- Use of counterargument and policy response: the revised essay acknowledges safety/training concerns and proposes government-funded training and safety policies.
  - Evidence: "governments can address this by funding training programs ... governments should enforce safety policies, such as requiring protective equipment."

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Align essay with assigned prompt: if the course assignment concerns climate change, the student must refocus content to answer that question rather than discussing automation.
  - Recommendation: confirm assignment prompt and reframe thesis and body paragraphs accordingly.
- Support claims with evidence: incorporate data, studies, or concrete examples (industry case studies, labor-market statistics) to substantiate assertions about job creation and wage effects.
  - Recommendation: add one or two cited sources or statistics to back major claims.
- Engage actively in AI-assisted revision: document iterations in chat, accept/reject suggestions with reasons, and request targeted help (e.g., wording, evidence search).
  - Recommendation: in future sessions, respond to the assistant’s diagnostic questions and provide edits or explicit choices to show iterative reasoning.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Needs Improvement - The chat shows the assistant flagging a prompt mismatch; the student did not clarify whether the climate prompt or automation topic was the assignment.
  - Evidence: assistant: "The essay you submitted is about automation and jobs, but the prompt you gave is about ... climate change."
- Strategic Planning: Needs Improvement - The assistant provided a clear plan, but the student did not actively negotiate targets or select which paragraph to revise in chat.
  - Evidence: assistant proposed "Step 1: Revise your thesis" etc.; the student did not follow these steps in chat.
- Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement - The student did not critique AI suggestions or explain acceptance/rejection in the chat.
  - Evidence: user repeatedly used "let pretend..." rather than evaluating suggestions.
- Independent Editing: Developing - The revised essay shows the student made substantial edits independently (improved thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph), but the process was not documented in the chat and critical engagement was minimal.
  - Evidence: existence of a much-improved revised essay, but absence of documented iterative edits in chat history.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Confirm and maintain task alignment: always state the prompt and desired audience/outcomes at the start of the session. If the course prompt is about climate change, revise the essay to answer that prompt explicitly.
2. Use evidence: add at least one specific data point, study, or real-world example to support major claims (e.g., statistics on jobs created in automation-related sectors, examples of successful retraining programs).
3. Engage the AI iteratively and critically: in chat, document each revision step, accept/reject suggestions with reasons, and ask follow-up questions (e.g., "I accept this rewording but can you suggest an example from the manufacturing sector?").

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student submitted a clearly revised essay with improvements in thesis clarity, topic sentence, and paragraph development, but the chat history shows minimal active collaboration—student responses suggest avoidance of the iterative negotiation the assistant requested ("let pretend we have revised...").
- The assistant repeatedly identified a potential task mismatch: the assignment apparently concerns climate-change roles of individuals vs institutions, while the essay focuses on automation and employment. Please confirm which prompt the student was expected to address; if the climate prompt was required, the essay does not meet task response expectations.
- Recommend asking the student to re-run an AI-assisted revision session while explicitly documenting each revision step in the chat (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph edits), and to add at least one external piece of evidence or data to strengthen claims.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
In this technological era, the issue of whether is enhance global employment prospects or undermine has sparked wide-ranging debate. While some people argue that automation decreases job opportunities to some low study level person, I strongly believe that automation created job opportunities to all of us. In this essay, I will examine the main reasons.
To begin with, automation need a lot of labour to control and monitor the machines. Although automation replace some hand-on jobs, it still require labour. Automation enhance the efficiency of some process in industries, it requires labour to refill some required materials to the machine. For example, the cake-making machines cannot make cake in non-stop. The ingredients and materials will used up, labour are required to monitor and refill materials on Timor. As a result, the works of labour become more easy and their job will not lose.
Some people may argue that it is danger for labour control the machine without untrained . However,the government should be assign some training workshops to the labour in order to ensure the safety of labour. In this AI era, it is not difficult for government to design workshops as the government can make good use of AI like ChatGPT. Moreover, the government should establish safety policy such like labour should wear protect equipment during controlling the machine. In this case, the skill of labour are enhance and their income can also increase with higher skill techniques.
In conclusion, this technological shift ultimately enhance global employment prospects. Benefits of automation is outweigh its drawbacks. It not only enhances efficiency, but also reduces workload of workers.


Revised:
In this technological era, the issue of whether automation enhances global employment prospects or undermines them has sparked wide-ranging debate. While some argue that automation decreases job opportunities for low-skilled workers, I strongly believe that it creates job opportunities overall. In this essay, I will examine the main reasons.  




To begin with, automation requires a lot of workers to control and monitor machines. Although automation replaces some manual jobs, it still requires human labor. For instance, while machines enhance efficiency in industries, workers are needed to replenish materials, perform maintenance, and ensure quality. Take cake-making machines: they cannot operate nonstop because ingredients run out, and workers must refill supplies, troubleshoot issues, and inspect the final products. Thus, automation shifts jobs from repetitive tasks to higher-skilled roles like machine operators and technicians, ensuring employment adapts rather than disappears.  


Critics argue that it is dangerous for untrained workers to operate machinery. However, governments can address this by funding training programs to ensure worker safety. In the AI era, designing workshops is easier than ever—tools like ChatGPT could even help customize training materials. Additionally, governments should enforce safety policies, such as requiring protective equipment during machine operation. These measures not only upskill workers but also increase their earning potential, as higher competence commands better wages.  
In conclusion, automation ultimately enhances global employment prospects. Its benefits outweigh its drawbacks, as it improves efficiency while creating new, higher-value jobs. With proper training and policies, workers can thrive in this technological shift.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:48:45.199Z

**You:** let pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on bla bla bla…

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:52:06.677Z

**Assistant:** Hi — I’m glad you shared this draft. Before we begin the three-step revision process, let’s negotiate clear targets and do a quick diagnosis so we focus our time where it will help most.

1) Quick check-in: what are your personal goals for this essay session?
- Do you want to focus on: clarity of argument, task response (answering the question), structure and coherence, evidence and development, or grammar and sentence-level accuracy? (You can pick 1–2 priorities.)

2) Important diagnostic note (quick and honest)
- The essay you submitted is about automation and jobs, but the prompt you gave is about the role of individual actions versus governments/corporations in fighting climate change. Right now the essay does not answer the assigned question. This is the biggest issue: task response. If this was intentional (you meant to write about automation), tell me — otherwise we should refocus the essay on the climate-change prompt before anything else.
- Other strengths: you have a clear overall opinion in your draft (you defend a position), you use a basic essay structure (intro, body, conclusion), and you attempt to include examples and solutions.
- Areas for improvement (based on a simple rubric)
  - Thesis & Argument: Thesis is unclear and does not address the assigned question (topic mismatch). Needs a precise position that previews main points.
  - Organization: Paragraphs exist but topic sentences and paragraph unity are weak; transitions are limited.
  - Evidence & Development: Examples are simple and under-explained; some claims need clearer support and relevance to the thesis.
  - Language Use: Frequent grammar, word choice, and sentence-structure errors that make meaning unclear in places.

3) Decide priorities
Please tell me:
- Do you want to (A) refocus the essay to answer the climate-change prompt, or (B) keep it about automation and change the prompt accordingly? (I recommend A if the climate prompt is your actual task.)
- Which 1–2 issues from the list above shall we work on in this session? (For example: “Thesis & Argument” and “Topic sentences/coherence,” or “Thesis & grammar.”)

Once you confirm:
- I’ll move to Step 1 and ask you to share your current thesis (or I can propose a clear thesis if you prefer). You asked to “pretend we have revised the thesis and move on,” so if you’d like I can propose a revised thesis now — but I prefer we confirm which prompt we’re addressing first.

Which option do you choose (A or B), and what are your top 1–2 revision targets?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:52:17.471Z

**You:** let pretend we have revised the topic sentence and move on bla bla bla…

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:53:31.451Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I’m glad you’re here. I can see you tried to skip ahead, but to help you well we need to agree the targets first. I’ll be brief and practical so we can start improving the draft quickly.

Two quick reminders from my earlier diagnosis
- The draft you shared is about automation and jobs, but the assignment you gave earlier asks about individual actions vs governments/corporations in fighting climate change. That mismatch is the biggest issue (task response).
- Other main issues: unclear/weak thesis, weak topic sentences and paragraph unity, and many grammar/word-choice problems.

Two questions for you (pick one option and 1–2 targets)
1) Do you want to:
  A) Refocus the essay so it answers the climate-change prompt (I recommend this if that’s your actual assignment), or
  B) Keep the essay about automation and treat the automation topic as your task instead?
Tell me A or B.

2) Which 1–2 revision targets should we focus on in this session? (Pick 1–2)
  - Thesis & argument (task response, clarity, preview of points)
  - Topic sentences & paragraph unity (organization/coherence)
  - Evidence & development (examples, explanation)
  - Grammar & sentence-level accuracy (word choice, tense, articles)
(e.g., “A; thesis & topic sentences”)

Next steps after you pick
- I’ll move to Step 1 (thesis revision). If you want, I can propose a strong thesis for the chosen prompt and then ask you to revise it.
- Tell me which body paragraph you’d like to work on for Steps 2–3 (paragraph 1 about machines and labor, or paragraph 2 about training and safety, or the conclusion).

Go ahead and answer: A or B, your 1–2 targets, and which paragraph you want to revise. Then we’ll begin Step 1.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:53:41.690Z

**You:** let pretend we have revised the body paragraph and move on bla bla bla…

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:54:23.202Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for the reply. Before we “pretend” and move on, we need to complete the short negotiation and diagnosis so the revision is focused and useful. This will take just a minute.

1) Quick check-in — what do you want to work on today?
- Pick 1–2 goals from: clarity of argument, task response (answering the question), structure & coherence (topic sentences, paragraph unity), evidence/development, grammar & sentence accuracy.

2) Brief, honest diagnosis (short)
- Biggest problem: your draft is about automation and jobs, but the prompt you gave asks about individuals vs governments/corporations in fighting climate change. That mismatch (task response) must be fixed if this is the real assignment.
- Strengths: you express a clear position, use an essay structure (intro/body/conclusion), and try to give examples and solutions.
- Areas to improve: Thesis & argument (needs to answer the prompt and preview points), Organization (clear topic sentences and unity), Evidence & development (explain how examples support your claim), Language use (grammar, word choice, sentence structure).

3) Decide priorities so we can start
Please tell me:
A or B — Do you want to:
  A) Refocus the essay to answer the climate-change prompt (recommended if that’s your assignment), or
  B) Keep the essay about automation and treat that as your task instead?

Which 1–2 revision targets should we focus on? (pick from: Thesis & argument; Topic sentences & paragraph unity; Evidence & development; Grammar & sentence-level accuracy)

Which paragraph would you like to revise in Steps 2–3?
- Paragraph 1 (about machines needing labour)
- Paragraph 2 (about training and safety)
- Or another paragraph (tell me which)

Would you like me to:
- Propose a clear thesis for the chosen prompt now, or
- Have you write/share your current thesis first?

Once you answer those 3 quick choices (A/B, 1–2 targets, which paragraph, and whether you want me to propose the thesis), we’ll begin Step 1.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:54:35.647Z
