            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for choosing to see model theses! Let’s take the next step.

Please pick your preferred option from these three thesis sentences or combine parts you like:  

**Option A:**  
AI-driven automation will significantly reduce global employment by displacing routine jobs, widening the gap between developed and developing countries, and concentrating benefits among firms unless governments adopt corrective policies.

**Option B:**  
Although AI can boost productivity, its rapid adoption threatens employment worldwide by replacing routine labor, increasing international inequality, and destabilizing vulnerable communities unless retraining and social policies are implemented.

**Option C:**  
AI promises efficiency gains, but it will fundamentally undermine employment prospects through routine-job displacement and growing economic inequality between nations; only proactive measures — education, social safety nets, and human–machine collaboration — can mitigate these harms.

Please paste the version you prefer below, with your own small edits if you wish. Then we’ll refine it together to match your style and essay.  

After that, paste the current topic sentence of your developing‑countries paragraph, and I’ll help you revise it with more advanced vocabulary and clearer links to the thesis.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The essay presents a clear stance that AI and automation undermine employment and discusses effects on both developed and developing countries. Ideas are relevant but often general and underdeveloped (e.g., “This will cause serious social hazards…” is asserted without concrete evidence or examples).
- Organization: 17/25 - The essay has identifiable paragraphs and a logical intent (chart description, position statement, developed-country effects, developing-country effects, concluding preference). However, transitions are weak and some repetition undermines coherence (several sentences repeat the same consequence in different words).
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Vocabulary is functional but basic and sometimes imprecise (“suffer for living,” “wider the gaps”). Word choice limits the clarity and formality expected at this course level.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 14/25 - Frequent grammatical errors and awkward sentences reduce clarity (e.g., “so that wider the gaps between low social classes and high social classes,” “suffer for living”). Sentence structures are mostly simple and occasionally ungrammatical.
- **Original Essay Total: 64/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The revised draft adds clearer, more focused claims in Task 2 (for example: “Although Al can boost productivity, its rapid adoption threatens employment worldwide…” and “AI-driven automation will significantly reduce global employment…”). These additions sharpen the argument, but development and concrete examples are still limited.
- Organization: 18/25 - Minor improvement: the revised draft includes an added summary sentence (oddly placed: “In summary, most countries in the sample saw native‑born populations outperform migrants…”) that is not relevant to the AI-employment argument and disrupts flow. Paragraph structure for the developing-countries paragraph remains largely unchanged.
- Vocabulary: 19/25 - The student incorporated more advanced phrasing (e.g., “threatens employment worldwide,” “widening the gap,” “destabilizing vulnerable communities,” “proactive measures — education, social safety nets, and human–machine collaboration”). This shows clear lexical improvement though some errors persist (e.g., inconsistent capitalization “Al”).
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 16/25 - Some sentences are improved in clarity, but grammatical mistakes and awkward constructions remain (e.g., repeated sentence fragments, occasional subject–verb issues, and local awkward phrasing in the developing-countries paragraph still present).
- **Revised Essay Total: 73/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +9 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - More explicit, forceful claims added to the revised Task 2 (e.g., “AI-driven automation will significantly reduce global employment…”), making the central argument clearer.
  - Introduction of higher-level vocabulary and phrasing (“destabilizing vulnerable communities,” “proactive measures,” “concentrating benefits among firms”) that raises the register.
  - Slightly clearer linking of technology adoption to inequality and international gaps.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The developing-countries paragraph (chosen for revision) remains essentially unchanged: topic sentence and paragraph unity were not substantively revised to reflect advanced vocabulary or tighter argumentation.
  - The essay lacks concrete evidence, data, or specific examples to support broad claims (no reference to the chart beyond the initial description; no statistics or case examples in the body to back up assertions).
  - Organization could be improved by removing irrelevant sentences (the new summary about migrants is unrelated to the AI theme) and by improving transitions and paragraph unity.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 12** (assistant and user turns combined)
- **Conversation Quality:** Productive guidance from the AI: clear plan, stepwise process (revise thesis, pick one paragraph, revise topic sentence + paragraph). The assistant provided model thesis options and stepwise scaffolding. The student asked for vocabulary polishing and then requested the model thesis options. However, the student did not complete the revision cycle in the chat (no confirmation/acceptance of a thesis choice or posting of a revised paragraph), and the requested paragraph revision was not posted as an AI-assisted revision in the chat.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Developing. Evidence: exchanges show useful scaffolding and incremental steps (assistant laid out a revision plan and provided a diagnostic). The number of turns (12) indicates a moderate-length conversation with clarifying questions, but it falls short of the extensive iterative cycle described in the “excellent” band.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 - Developing. Evidence: the student requested model thesis sentences and asked for more advanced vocabulary, indicating some selectivity, but there is limited evidence in the chat of the student critically weighing alternative suggestions or rejecting/altering AI proposals with reasoned justification.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - Basic. Evidence: the assistant proposed a three-step revision process and provided model theses, but the student did not complete the full revision cycle in chat. The developing-countries paragraph—selected for revision—was pasted by the student but the assistant’s revised paragraph was not delivered and the student did not post a revised version. The revision process therefore shows minimal iteration.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 8/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear overall stance: the student consistently argues that automation threatens employment and inequality (evidence: original thesis and the revised sentences in Task 2).
- Willingness to accept guidance: the student followed the assistant’s process, asked for more advanced vocabulary, and asked explicitly for model thesis sentences (chat: “See 2–3 model thesis sentences I can suggest for you to adapt?ok”).
- Vocabulary uptake: the revised essay shows incorporation of higher-register phrasing introduced in the assistant’s model theses.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Complete the requested revision cycle: revise the thesis explicitly in the chat (choose and adapt a model), then revise the topic sentence and the full developing-country paragraph as intended.
- Evidence and development: add concrete support for claims (data from the chart, examples, case studies, or citations).
- Grammar and clarity: address recurring grammatical problems (sentence fragments, awkward collocations) and improve sentence variety.
- Organization and relevance: remove or relocate irrelevant sentences (e.g., the new “In summary…” sentence about migrants is unrelated) and strengthen transitions and paragraph unity.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - Student provided the original and revised drafts and identified a target paragraph; however, there was ambiguity about the assignment prompt initially (climate-change vs AI/employment), which the assistant highlighted. Evidence: assistant asked “Which prompt do you want…?” and the student confirmed working on AI/employment in chat.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student agreed to a three-step plan (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph) and prioritized vocabulary and thesis strength.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student requested model theses and vocabulary refinements but did not document a critical comparison of alternatives, nor did they explain acceptance/rejection choices in chat.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The student did not complete the editing steps in chat; the developing-countries paragraph was not upgraded in the assistant interaction, and changes in the revised essay are partial.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Complete the full revision loop in the collaborative session: choose or adapt one model thesis in chat, then post a revised topic sentence and paragraph for iterative feedback. This documents the student’s decision-making and shows learning progress.
2. Add concrete evidence and clearer examples to support claims — for example, cite a statistic from the chart (e.g., Hong Kong ~30% vs India ~10%) and tie it to the argument about substitution and inequality.
3. Focus a targeted grammar pass on problematic constructions (e.g., “wider the gaps” → “widen the gap,” “suffer for living” → “struggle to make a living”) and aim for varied sentence structures (combine shorter sentences, use subordinators) to improve readability.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student requested a thesis + paragraph revision and received model thesis options from the assistant, which the student appears to have partially incorporated into the revised essay. However, the key requested work—revising the developing-countries paragraph (topic sentence and paragraph content) with more advanced vocabulary—was not completed within the chat. The revised essay still contains the original paragraph largely unchanged and retains several grammatical issues.
- For grading/feedback purposes: encourage the student to re-run the final revision cycle in chat (pick a thesis option and explicitly post a revised paragraph) so the instructor can see the student’s active revision choices and interaction with the AI.
- Suggested next step for the student in class: produce a short annotated version of the revised developing-countries paragraph showing original sentence → revised sentence with brief rationale for each change (this demonstrates independent editing and critical evaluation of AI suggestions).

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Set one
Task 1
The chart illustrates the share of Full-Time Equivalent Employment Exposed to Automation by AI. Among all the data, Hong Kong gets the biggest share, which is nearly 30 percent. And the lowest share belongs to India, which is nearly 10 percent. Among all the cities and countries, some of them belong to the developed market economies have a higher share than the countries from Emerging Market, which showcases that the economic developing competence is significantly and positively relevant with the share of Full-Time Equivalent Employment Exposed to Automation by AI. Argentina is the only country from the Emerging market that has a higher share than the countries which are from developed market economies. The global share is around 15 percent. As for the countries below the global share, a large number of them are from Asia Area, which illustrates that Asia Area has not adopted sufficient AI for employment.

Task 2:
From my perspective, technological shift ultimately undermines global employment prospects in the long term.

Nowadays, AI technology can accomplish some labor work such as delivering the boxes, mastering some simple and repeatable regular work in the factory. Its advantage is high efficiency, low cost and fewer mistakes than human labor. Hence, in some countries, the developed market economy has already replaced some human labor by AI, which significantly lowers the cost and saves the salaries of employment. In this case, more and more labor who do the simple work will be replaced by AI, so that they will lose their work and suffer for living. This will cause serious social hazards such as increasing the number of homeless people and maybe cause some campaigns.

As for the developing countries, large quantities of them earn money from agriculture and simple industries, which are easily displaced by automatic machines and AI technology. In that case, the developing countries will lose their income and revenue so that wider the gaps between low social classes and high social classes. This will destroy the global harmony among different countries and may widen the GDP gaps between developed countries and developing countries. Those countries from emerging market economies can’t get sufficient income for building infrastructure or developing high-technology.

So that they will never become a developed country, so that ultimately, this will affect sustainable development from global views.
As for AI usage for employment, I think it can be used for enhancing the efficiency of labor work instead of replacing labor. AI can boost efficiency by using machines. So I consider that letting humans use machines for agriculture and the industry field is a win-win situation. In that case, AI can accelerate working efficiency as well as ensure global employment. Initially, the aim of creating AI is to serve humans and make people’s lives easier instead of replacing humans.

In summary, most countries in the sample saw native-born populations outperform migrants in employment outcomes, with Spain exhibiting the widest disparity, and Croatia being the only nation where migrants had a clear employment edge.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-22T13:18:07.624Z

**You:** help me to Revise my thesis statement.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T13:33:03.179Z

**Assistant:** Great — I can help. Before we begin revising the thesis, let’s do the short preliminary stage so we have clear targets.

1) Quick negotiation: what do you want most from this session? (Choose any)
- Make the thesis answer the assigned question clearly and directly
- Strengthen the argument (more precise claim and preview of main points)
- Improve language and confidence (no hedging)
- Make the thesis match the rest of the essay (alignment)
Which of these is your top priority? Or write your own.

2) Clarifying question about the assignment
Your “Current Topic” at the top is a climate-change prompt (about the importance of individual actions vs governments/corporations). But your essay discusses AI and employment. Which task do you want the thesis for?
- The climate-change prompt (individual actions vs governments/corporations), or
- The AI/employment essay you wrote here?

Tell me which one so I can make the thesis fit the right prompt.

3) Brief diagnostic (based on what you wrote)
- Thesis & Argument: Your current thesis sentence (“From my perspective, technological shift ultimately undermines global employment prospects in the long term.”) is clear about your view on automation, but it does not answer the climate-change prompt. It also doesn’t preview the main reasons you will use to support the claim. If your assignment is the AI/employment essay, the claim needs to preview the main causes/effects or solutions you’ll discuss.
- Organization: You have paragraphs that try to develop causes and effects, but transitions and paragraph unity can be stronger. Some sentences are repetitive.
- Evidence & Development: You describe plausible effects of automation, but you need clearer examples, explanation, and stronger links between claims and consequences.
- Language Use: There are grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and some word-choice issues (e.g., “suffer for living,” “wider the gaps”) that make meaning unclear.

Strengths: You have a clear opinion, you recognize both harms and possible benefits of AI, and you attempt to discuss effects on both developed and developing countries.

4) Pick the focus
Which diagnosed issue(s) do you want to focus on right now? (Pick one or two)
- Fixing the thesis so it answers the climate-change prompt
- Fixing the thesis for the AI/employment essay you wrote
- Thesis + previewing main points (so thesis both answers and outlines structure)
- Thesis + language (make it confident and precise)

Confirm your choice and confirm which prompt we’re targeting. Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 1: you’ll either try a revised thesis or I’ll offer suggested revisions (I’ll encourage you to try first, then provide 2–3 model thesis options you can pick or adapt).

*Time:* 2025-11-22T13:33:29.610Z

**You:** please modify my expression and polish my vocabulary to make the composition more advanced

*Time:* 2025-11-22T14:02:03.664Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for the clear instructions and for sharing your drafts. Before I start editing, we need to finish the short preliminary stage so our work has clear targets.

1) Choose your top priority (pick one or two)
- Make the thesis answer the assigned question clearly and directly
- Strengthen the argument (more precise claim + preview of main points)
- Improve language and confidence (no hedging; more advanced vocabulary)
- Make the thesis match the rest of the essay (alignment)
Which of the above is your main goal? Or write your own (briefly).

2) Which prompt should I target?
Your essay is about AI and employment, but the “Current Topic” is a climate-change prompt. Which do you want the thesis and revisions for?
- The climate-change prompt (individual actions vs governments/corporations), or
- The AI/employment essay you wrote here

3) Quick diagnostic (based on your current AI/employment draft)
- Thesis & Argument: You state a clear opinion (automation undermines employment) but the thesis doesn’t preview the main reasons or solutions you’ll discuss.
- Organization: Paragraphs need clearer topic sentences and stronger transitions; some ideas repeat.
- Development & Evidence: Claims are plausible but need clearer explanation and more concrete examples or consequences.
- Language: There are grammar errors and some awkward phrases; vocabulary can be more precise and formal.

Strengths: clear stance, awareness of effects on developed vs developing countries, and you end by acknowledging a balanced option (AI as efficiency booster).

4) Which diagnosed issue(s) do you want to focus on now? (pick one or two)
- Revise the thesis to answer and preview points
- Make the thesis more confident and polished (advanced vocabulary)
- Revise thesis + one body paragraph (topic sentence + paragraph content)
- Focus mainly on language polishing for the thesis and one paragraph

Confirm your choices and which prompt I should target. Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 1: please share (or confirm) your current thesis sentence and tell me which body paragraph you’d like to revise first (e.g., “paragraph about developing countries”), then try a short revision if you want — I’ll encourage you to draft before I give model options.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T14:02:19.916Z

**You:** Revise thesis + one body paragraph (topic sentence + paragraph content).more advanced vocabulary

*Time:* 2025-11-22T14:04:17.706Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing targets. Quick recap and one question so we start in the right place.

Confirmed targets
- Focus: Revise the thesis and one body paragraph (topic sentence + paragraph content).
- Priority: Make the thesis stronger, more confident, and use more advanced vocabulary.
- Prompt: We’ll work on the AI/employment essay you wrote (not the climate-change prompt), correct?

Which paragraph
- Do you want to revise the paragraph about developing countries? (The paragraph that begins “As for the developing countries, large quantities of them earn money from agriculture and simple industries…”) If yes, we’ll work on that one.

Step 1: Thesis revision — quick guidance
- Your current thesis: “From my perspective, technological shift ultimately undermines global employment prospects in the long term.”
- Quick feedback: This states your view clearly but it’s hedged (“From my perspective”), lacks a preview of reasons, and could use stronger, more precise language and a sharper stance. A strong thesis for this essay should:
  - Use confident language (no “from my perspective” or “I think”).
  - Make a clear claim about the overall effect of AI on employment.
  - Preview 2–3 main reasons or areas you will discuss (e.g., displacement of routine jobs, widening inequality between developed and developing countries, and possible mitigation via augmentation or policy).
  - Stay concise (one or two sentences).

Now your turn
- Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Try one sentence that: states your claim confidently and previews the main points you will develop.
- If you prefer, I can provide 2–3 model thesis options after you attempt one.

Next steps after you post the new thesis
- I’ll give targeted feedback and ask you to revise again (if needed) until you’re happy.
- Then we’ll move to Step 2: pick the developing-countries paragraph (confirm) and post its current topic sentence so you can try improving it to align with the new thesis.

Go ahead and paste your revised thesis (one or two sentences). Would you like me to give examples only if you ask, or would you like me to show 2–3 model theses right away?

*Time:* 2025-11-22T14:04:53.417Z

**You:** As for the developing countries, large quantities of them earn money from agriculture and simple industries, which are easily displaced by automatic machines and AI technology. In that case, the developing countries will lose their income and revenue so that wider the gaps between low social classes and high social classes. This will destroy the global harmony among different countries and may widen the GDP gaps between developed countries and developing countries. Those countries from emerging market economic can’t get sufficient income for building infrastructure or developing high-technology.
please can the simple word to advanced word

*Time:* 2025-11-22T14:10:39.581Z

**Assistant:** Great — this is clear and helpful. Quick check so we start in the right place:

1) Confirmed goals
- Focus: Revise the thesis and one body paragraph (the developing‑countries paragraph).
- Priority: Replace simple words with more advanced vocabulary and make the thesis stronger and more confident.
- Prompt: We’re working on the AI / employment essay (not the climate-change prompt), correct?

2) Paragraph to revise
- You picked the paragraph that begins “As for the developing countries, large quantities of them earn money from agriculture and simple industries…” — I’ll help with the topic sentence and the rest of that paragraph once we finish the thesis.

Step 1 — Thesis revision (quick)
- Your current thesis: “From my perspective, technological shift ultimately undermines global employment prospects in the long term.”
- Quick feedback: Good opinion, but remove hedging (“From my perspective”), be more precise, and preview the main reasons you’ll discuss (for example: displacement of routine jobs, widening inequality between richer and poorer countries, and possible ways to mitigate the harm).

Would you like to:
A) Try rewriting the thesis now (one or two sentences)? — I’ll give feedback on your attempt; or
B) See 2–3 model thesis sentences I can suggest for you to adapt?

Say A or B. Once we settle the thesis, we’ll move to Step 2 and I’ll help you upgrade the paragraph vocabulary.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T14:10:57.379Z

**You:** See 2–3 model thesis sentences I can suggest for you to adapt?ok

*Time:* 2025-11-22T14:11:45.977Z

**Assistant:** Great — here are three model thesis sentences you can adapt. Each is confident, answers the essay’s main claim, and previews the main points you can develop.

Option A (strong, problem-focused)
AI-driven automation will significantly reduce global employment by displacing routine jobs, widening the gap between developed and developing countries, and concentrating benefits among firms unless governments adopt corrective policies.

Option B (balanced — acknowledges benefits but warns)
Although AI can boost productivity, its rapid adoption threatens employment worldwide by replacing routine labor, increasing international inequality, and destabilizing vulnerable communities unless retraining and social policies are implemented.

Option C (assertive + points to solutions)
AI promises efficiency gains, but it will fundamentally undermine employment prospects through routine-job displacement and growing economic inequality between nations; only proactive measures — education, social safety nets, and human–machine collaboration — can mitigate these harms.

Which one do you prefer as a starting point? Or would you like to mix elements from two of them? Pick one and, if you can, paste it back with any small edits you make so we can refine it together. Once you’re happy with the thesis, we’ll move on to Step 2: please paste the current topic sentence of the developing‑countries paragraph so you can try a revision that ties directly to the new thesis.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T14:12:00.538Z
