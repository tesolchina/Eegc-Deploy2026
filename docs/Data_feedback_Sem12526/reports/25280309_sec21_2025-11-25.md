# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The essay states a clear position ("I partly agree") and presents two relevant main ideas (influencing government; personal green choices). Examples (voting, protests, consumer pressure) are offered, but development is uneven and some claims are general or repeated.
- Organization: 20/25 - A conventional structure is present (introduction, two body paragraphs, conclusion). Paragraphing is appropriate, but transitions and logical tightness need work (repetition and occasional drift).
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary is generally appropriate but simple and repetitive (e.g., "sometimes," "maybe," "not really enough"); more topic-specific and precise terms would strengthen the essay.
- Grammar: 17/25 - Understandable overall, but there are multiple grammatical and phrasing errors that affect polish and occasionally clarity (examples: "the government maybe just listen a little," "so nothing happen," "it not really enough").
- **Original Essay Total: 76/100**

Evidence (original essay quotes):
- Thesis and stance: "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government... personal green lifestyle choices... still have a role to play."
- Example and development: "if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy."

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The revised version contains placeholders and no concrete rewritten thesis. The essay retains the original ideas but lacks actual improvement or additional content to deepen argument.
- Organization: 16/25 - Placeholders ("bla bla bla", "revised thesis statement here") interrupt coherence and make the revised draft disorganized. The structure is still visible but not fully realized.
- Vocabulary: 16/25 - No substantive lexical improvements; placeholders and repeated original wording remain.
- Grammar: 15/25 - The revision introduces non-substantive text and leaves original grammatical issues uncorrected.
- **Revised Essay Total: 65/100**

Evidence (revised essay quotes):
- Placeholder instead of thesis: "bla bla bla...(revised thesis statement here)"
- Placeholder for paragraph revision: "revised topic sentence...When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. ...revise the rest of body paragraph #1 ..."
- Unchanged paragraph retained: second body paragraph and conclusion remain nearly identical to the original.

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -11 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None substantive — the student signalled intent to revise but did not provide concrete rewrites in the submitted revised essay.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Revise and present a clear, concise thesis that previews both main points (mandatory step in assistant guidance).
  - Produce and confirm a stronger topic sentence that links directly to the thesis and previews supporting points.
  - Revise the body paragraph's supporting sentences for clarity, evidence, and grammar (the assistant repeatedly requested these steps but the student did not supply actual revisions).

---

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 12 messages** (chat log contains 12 entries, alternating assistant/user).
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided clear, structured guidance (stepwise process, checklists, and revision criteria). The student replied repeatedly with "let's pretend..." and placeholders rather than completing requested revision steps. The interaction shows the student engaging at a surface level but not doing the required text edits.

Representative chat evidence:
- Assistant's instruction to paste revised thesis: "Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?"
- Student posted original thesis once but then responded: "let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement" and later "let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on bla bla bla …"
- Assistant repeatedly insisted on mandatory steps: "Before we revise the supporting sentences, we must complete Steps 1 and 2... I can’t revise the supporting sentences until those two are confirmed."

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - The chat shows multiple back-and-forth messages and detailed guidance from the assistant, but the student did not supply substantive rewritten text. There is some apparent engagement but limited depth of actual revision work.
  - Evidence: 12 messages and repeated assistant scaffolding, but the student's contributions did not include revised thesis or topic sentence.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - The student did not demonstrate critical engagement with the assistant's suggestions (no acceptance/rejection with reasons); instead the student repeatedly avoided performing the requested rewrites.
  - Evidence: Assistant offered checklists and concrete revision steps; student replied "let's pretend..." rather than evaluating or implementing suggestions.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - Minimal visible iteration; the assistant repeatedly prompted mandatory steps but the student did not perform the iterative revisions. There is guidance provided for cycles, but no documented revisions.
  - Evidence: Assistant's stepwise instructions (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) were not followed with actual drafts.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The original draft contained a clear position and two logical supporting ideas (thesis: "I partly agree... influence the government... personal green lifestyle choices").
- The assistant provided strong scaffolding and a clear revision process (explicit checklists for thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph revision).
- The student showed willingness to engage in dialog (multiple responses), indicating openness to AI support (even if responses were not substantive edits).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- The student must produce concrete revisions (revised thesis, revised topic sentence, and edited paragraph) rather than claiming to have revised. Actionable next steps:
  1. Paste an explicit revised thesis that answers the prompt and previews the two arguments.
  2. Paste a revised topic sentence for paragraph 1 that links to the thesis and previews supporting moves (e.g., voting, protests, petitions).
  3. Paste the fully revised body paragraph with clearer examples and corrected grammar.
- Greater critical engagement: when the assistant gives options, the student should accept, modify, or reject them with reasons.
- Grammar and lexical refinement: focus on sentence-level editing to remove common errors and improve vocabulary precision.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student did not supply the requested revised text despite prompts; course context was given by the assistant but the student did not provide the outputs needed for effective collaboration.
  - Evidence: Repeated assistant requests, e.g., "Please paste your current (revised) thesis statement here," were not fulfilled.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The assistant laid out a clear strategy, but the student did not follow through with the required steps (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph).
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - No evidence the student evaluated AI suggestions; responses like "let's pretend" indicate avoidance of concrete decision-making.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The student did not perform or display independent edits in the revised submission.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Complete the mandatory steps in sequence: post a revised thesis, then a revised topic sentence, then the revised paragraph. Use the assistant's checklists to self-check each item before posting.
2. When the AI offers alternatives or feedback, respond explicitly: accept, reject, or modify, and give a brief reason to demonstrate critical evaluation.
3. For sentence-level improvements, run a focused self-edit pass: correct verb agreement, tense, articles, and common collocations; then ask the AI to proofread that specific passage for remaining errors.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student engaged in the interactive session but did not provide the concrete rewrites requested. The submitted "revised" essay contains placeholders and therefore cannot be evaluated as a proper revision.
- Recommend requiring the student to resubmit the three mandatory items (revised thesis, revised topic sentence, revised body paragraph) in order to demonstrate mastery of the revision process and to allow a full assessment of improvement and human-AI collaboration skills.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:56:12.363Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:56:23.364Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — you already have a clear position and two supporting ideas, which is a good start. Now let’s tighten the thesis so it answers the question more directly and previews the essay’s structure with confident language.

Quick feedback on your current thesis:
- Clarity: You say you “partly agree,” but the exact degree and reason could be clearer. Which view is stronger — the power of governments/corporations or the power of individuals?
- Focus: You mention two ideas (influencing government; personal lifestyle). Those are good main points — they should appear explicitly in the thesis as the essay’s roadmap.
- Tone: Avoid phrases like “I think” or “I also think.” Use more confident verbs (e.g., “recognise,” “accept,” “argue” — but don’t let me write the sentence for you).

Checklist for your revised thesis (use this to guide your rewrite):
- Directly answer the question (state the extent to which you agree/disagree).
- Preview the main points you will discuss (e.g., political influence, consumer choices/market pressure).
- Use precise, confident language and keep it concise.

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now? Paste your revised thesis when you’re ready.

Also, which body paragraph would you like to work on next — the paragraph about influencing government (paragraph 1) or the paragraph about personal lifestyle choices (paragraph 2)? Paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence (or tell me which one you choose) and we’ll move to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:56:37.555Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:57:10.757Z

**Assistant:** Great — we’ll treat the thesis as revised. Quick check: are you satisfied with your new thesis (does it clearly answer the question, previews your two main points, and use confident language)? If yes, we’ll move on.

Which body paragraph would you like to work on: the paragraph about influencing government (paragraph 1) or the one about personal lifestyle choices (paragraph 2)? Tell me which one, and paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence here.

Before you paste, a short guide for the topic-sentence revision so you know what I’ll look for:
- Clear link to your revised thesis (show how this paragraph supports your overall position).
- One main claim only (keeps the paragraph focused).
- A confident verb (e.g., “enable,” “compel,” “pressure,” “demonstrate”) rather than “maybe” or “can be.”
- A preview of the paragraph’s support (mention protest, voting, petitions, market signals, etc., as appropriate).

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now and paste it? If you prefer, paste the original topic sentence and I’ll give focused feedback and suggest brief revision strategies (not a full rewritten sentence).

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:57:27.921Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:59:09.881Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s follow the Three-Step Revision Process. First I need your revised thesis before we move on.

Step 1 — Thesis statement
1) Please paste your current (revised) thesis here.
2) Quick, focused feedback I’ll give once you paste it: I will comment on clarity, strength, and whether it previews the essay’s main points. I’ll also point out any weak wording (examples: “I think,” “maybe,” or vague phrases) and suggest stronger verbs or a clearer structure. 
3) A few short tips for your rewrite (use these to revise — don’t write a full new sentence for me):
   - Start with a clear stance: decide whether you “partly agree,” “agree,” or “disagree,” and state that confidently.
   - Immediately preview your two main reasons (e.g., political influence; consumer/personal choices and market pressure).
   - Use a confident verb (recognise, accept, argue, maintain) and keep it concise.
4) When you’ve pasted a revised version, I’ll give targeted suggestions. We must confirm you’re satisfied with the thesis before moving to Step 2.

Which paragraph would you like to work on next — the one about influencing government (paragraph 1) or the one about personal lifestyle/consumer choices (paragraph 2)? Paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence (or tell me which one), and we’ll move to the topic-sentence revision. Would you like to try revising the thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:59:40.719Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences
 and move on bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-11-25T08:01:44.281Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s follow the Three‑Step Revision Process. I’ll guide you step by step. First I need your revised thesis.

Step 1 — Thesis statement
1) Please paste your current (revised) thesis here.
2) Quick guidance while you prepare it (do not copy a full sentence from me — use these points to rewrite):
   - Start with a clear stance: decide whether you “agree,” “disagree,” or “partly agree” and state it confidently.
   - Immediately preview the two main reasons you will discuss (for example: political influence; consumer/behavioural impact on markets).
   - Use a strong verb (recognise, argue, maintain, accept) and avoid hedges like “I think” or “maybe.”
   - Keep it concise — one or two lines that answer the question and outline the essay structure.

When you paste your revised thesis, I’ll give focused feedback on clarity, strength, and whether it previews your main points. I’ll also suggest small wording improvements — then you’ll confirm you’re satisfied before we move on.

Which paragraph would you like to work on next — the one about influencing government (paragraph 1) or the one about personal lifestyle/consumer choices (paragraph 2)? Paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence (or tell me which one), and we’ll move to Step 2. Would you like to paste the thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T08:02:25.911Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1
bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-11-25T08:03:22.736Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m glad you’re ready to work on paragraph 1. Before we revise the rest of that paragraph, we must complete Steps 1 and 2 of the Three‑Step Revision Process: revise the thesis (mandatory) and revise the paragraph’s topic sentence. I can’t revise the supporting sentences until those two are confirmed.

Step 1 — Thesis statement (mandatory)
Please paste your revised thesis statement here. If you want, you can also paste your original thesis (“I partly agree…”) so I can compare, but I need to see your new thesis before we continue.

Quick guidance to help you rewrite (do not copy a full sentence from me — use these points to craft your own):
- Decide and state your exact stance (agree, disagree, or partly agree) and make it confident.
- Preview the two main reasons you will discuss (e.g., individual influence on government/policy; individual/consumer behaviour shaping markets and social norms).
- Use a strong verb (recognise, maintain, argue) and avoid hedges like “I think” or “maybe.”
- Keep it concise — one or two sentences that directly answer the question and outline your essay structure.

Example checklist to use when you write your thesis:
- Does it answer the question clearly?
- Does it preview the two main points you will develop?
- Is the language confident and specific?

Would you like to try pasting your revised thesis now?

Step 2 — Topic sentence for paragraph 1
You chose paragraph 1 (influencing government). Please paste the current topic sentence for that paragraph. If you prefer, confirm that the current sentence is the one from your draft:
“The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”

Quick feedback on that sentence (so you know what to improve):
- Strengths: It is directly relevant and introduces the paragraph’s focus.
- To improve: Make the connection to your (revised) thesis explicit, use a more confident verb (e.g., “compel,” “pressure,” “motivate”), and preview the types of influence you will explain (e.g., voting, protesting, petitions, public campaigns). This helps the reader see how the paragraph supports your overall argument.

Revision guidance (not a full rewritten sentence):
- Link phrase: add a phrase showing how this idea supports your thesis (for example, “because collective pressure can change policy” — write your own words).
- One strong verb: choose a verb like “pressure” or “compel” instead of “can help.”
- Preview support: mention 2–3 forms of civic action you will discuss (voting, protests, petitions, consumer pressure).

Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence now? Paste your attempt and I’ll give focused, brief feedback. Once you and I are satisfied with the thesis and topic sentence, we’ll move on to revising the paragraph’s supporting sentences.
