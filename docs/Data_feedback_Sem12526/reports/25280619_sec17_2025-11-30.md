            ## Contribution Analysis

            It looks like the session’s main obstacle was the student’s repeated use of placeholders instead of submitting the actual revised thesis, topic sentences, and paragraph text needed to complete the revision process.

Your assessment report thoroughly documents the gap between the assistant’s structured, stepwise support and the student's minimal substantive input. The identification of missed opportunities, key improvement areas, and concrete next-step recommendations is clear and actionable.

**If you want, here are a few suggestions to make this report even more effective for future instructors or tutors:**

- **Add a brief summary upfront** that highlights the core issue succinctly, e.g., “The student did not replace placeholder text with actual revisions despite multiple prompts, which blocked progress through the training steps.”

- **Include a brief note on student motivation or engagement** inferred from the chat (e.g., placeholders may indicate avoidance or lack of readiness to revise).

- **Suggest potential instructor interventions** (e.g., require mandatory submission of a real thesis before grading, or schedule a follow-up check-in).

- **Clarify that the assistant provided adequate scaffolding, but the student must actively engage.**

Otherwise, your detailed scoring, analysis, and recommendations comprehensively capture both the writing and collaboration aspects.

If you want, I can help you draft a concise executive summary or a formal cover note for this assessment report. Would that be helpful?

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The essay takes a clear position ("I partly agree") and develops two relevant points (citizens influencing government; personal green choices). Examples are general but appropriate (e.g., “people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment”). Some claims are repetitive and underdeveloped.
- Organization: 20/25 - Introduction, two body paragraphs, and conclusion are present and logically ordered. Paragraph transitions exist but are weak in places (repetition and some sentence-level incoherence hinder flow).
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary is adequate but simple and repetitive (“people,” “change,” “green things”); some topic-specific terms are used but could be more precise (e.g., “influence policy” instead of “influence the government”).
- Grammar: 17/25 - Frequent grammar and phrasing errors affect clarity: e.g., “the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action,” “nothing happen,” “so this is problem.” Sentence structures are mostly simple.
- **Original Essay Total: 76/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 15/25 - The revised submission contains placeholders (“bla bla bla …”, “revised topic sentence| bla bla bla …”, “revise the rest of body paragraph #1 ...”), so meaningful content revisions are absent. The original concluding paragraph remains unchanged, but the main revision work is not present.
- Organization: 15/25 - Placeholders interrupt paragraph structure and coherence. Because key revision elements (thesis rewrite, revised topic sentence, revised paragraph) were not supplied, the organization appears incomplete.
- Vocabulary: 13/25 - Many placeholder strings replace actual wording; where text remains (conclusion), vocabulary is unchanged and still simple. Overall the revision does not demonstrate improved word choice.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Existing grammatical issues from the original remain in the unchanged parts; placeholders make it impossible to assess attempted grammar improvements. Some original errors persist (e.g., “so it not really enough”).
- **Revised Essay Total: 57/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -19 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None substantive — the revision file contains placeholders rather than completed revisions.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Revise the thesis into a single concise, confident sentence that previews both main points (policy influence; personal actions).
  - Replace placeholder topic sentence(s) with explicit, focused topic sentences that link directly to the revised thesis.
  - Revise body paragraph text to add specific evidence, clearer examples, and correct grammar.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 12 messages** (assistant and user turns in the provided chat).
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant consistently guided the student through a stepwise process (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph). The student responded with the original thesis once, but repeatedly used placeholders ("let's pretend we have revised the thesis", "Enter bla bla bla …") instead of posting the requested revisions. The assistant asked for concrete inputs multiple times; the student did not supply the needed revised sentences to proceed.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 - Although there are multiple assistant messages, the student's contributions are minimal and mostly placeholders. The exchange lacks substantive back-and-forth on revisions or in-depth questioning from the student. Evidence: the student repeatedly replies with "let's pretend..." or placeholders rather than actual revised text.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 - There is little to no evidence the student evaluated or justified accepting/rejecting AI guidance. The assistant suggested concrete improvements (e.g., remove hedges, preview two reasons), but the student did not demonstrate evaluation or selective adoption of these suggestions. Evidence: after many prompts asking for a real revised thesis, the student continued to use placeholders.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 - No iterative revisions are visible. The assistant repeatedly requested a revised thesis and a topic sentence to proceed; the student did not supply them, so no documented revision cycles occurred.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 4/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The original draft shows a clear basic argument and structure (intro, two supporting paragraphs, conclusion). Evidence: original thesis sentence and concluding paragraph both state a partial-agreement stance and list two supporting ideas.
- The assistant provided consistent, structured scaffolding for revision (clear steps and checklists). Evidence: assistant repeatedly framed a three-step process and gave concrete phrasing tips (e.g., remove hedges, preview reasons).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Follow-through: The student must replace placeholders with real revised text (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph) to complete the assignment.
- Engagement with AI feedback: Actively apply, test, and critique the assistant’s suggestions—paste revised sentences and explain choices.
- Sentence-level accuracy and vocabulary: Focus on removing hedges, tightening phrasing, and correcting grammatical errors (e.g., subject-verb agreement, verb forms, articles).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student provided the original essay but did not supply the requested revised thesis or topic sentences despite multiple prompts. Evidence: repeated placeholders in revised essay and chat.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The student did not follow the assistant’s stepwise revision plan to completion.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - No examples of the student accepting, modifying, or rejecting AI suggestions with justification.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The revised submission does not demonstrate the student’s independent application of the assistant’s guidance.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Complete the required revision steps: paste a one-sentence revised thesis, then a revised topic sentence, then the revised paragraph text. The assistant can then give targeted feedback and help iterate.
2. Engage critically with AI suggestions: when the assistant offers options, pick one, justify why you accept or modify it, and try it in the text. This demonstrates active learning and improves outcomes.
3. Focus next revision round on clarity and correctness: remove hedges, use precise vocabulary (“influence policy,” “consumer demand”), correct grammar errors (e.g., “nothing happen” → “nothing happens”), and add one concrete example or statistic to strengthen each body paragraph.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student did not complete the core revision tasks required by the module (thesis rewrite, topic sentence revision, paragraph revision). The revised essay contains placeholder text rather than substantive edits.
- The chat history shows the assistant provided clear guidance and multiple prompts; the lack of student follow-through is the primary barrier to progress. Instructor intervention or explicit expectations (e.g., require the student to submit the revised thesis and paragraph before grading) is recommended.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T12:42:57.861Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T13:07:12.341Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for sharing your thesis. Let’s start Step 1.

Step 1 — Review of your current thesis
Your current thesis:
"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

What’s good
- It answers the question: you take a position (partial agreement).
- It mentions the two main points you use in the essay: citizen pressure on government and personal lifestyle choices.

How to improve (clear, specific, confident)
- Make it more concise and confident (avoid hedges like “I think” or repeated “also”).
- Preview the structure more clearly: name the two ways individuals matter and show their relative weight (which you already imply).
- Use stronger, precise language (e.g., “influence policy” rather than “influence the government”).
- Avoid repetition and keep it to one clear sentence if possible.

Quick checklist for your revision
- Directly answer the prompt (extent of agreement).
- Preview the two main supporting points in the order you will discuss them.
- Use confident verbs and precise nouns.
- Keep it concise (one strong sentence).

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using that checklist? Please paste your revised thesis. Once you’re happy with it, confirm and we’ll move to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T13:07:24.014Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement Enter bla bla bla ...

*Time:* 2025-11-30T13:07:52.847Z

**Assistant:** Okay — great. Before we move on, please paste your revised thesis (replace the "bla bla bla" placeholder). I’ll give quick feedback and confirm it’s ready.

When you’ve done that, tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (paragraph 2 about influencing government, or paragraph 3 about personal lifestyle choices). Paste the current topic sentence for that paragraph and I’ll review how well it connects to your revised thesis and suggest how to strengthen that connection. Would you like to paste the thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T13:08:01.866Z

**You:** move on

*Time:* 2025-11-30T13:08:13.379Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — quick note: Step 1 (thesis revision) is required before we move on to the paragraph work. I won’t write a full replacement sentence for you, but I will give very focused guidance so you can quickly produce a stronger thesis.

What to change (short, specific):
- Remove hedges like “I think,” “maybe,” or repeated “also.” Use confident language.
- State your position clearly (e.g., “I partly agree” or “I agree to some extent”).
- Preview the two main reasons in order (e.g., citizen pressure on policy; personal lifestyle choices’ role).
- Use precise verbs and nouns: influence policy, compel government action, shape consumer demand, change social norms.

Helpful fragments you can combine (do not use these as a full sentence — just pieces to guide you):
- “partly agree because…”
- “citizen pressure can compel policy change”
- “personal green choices, though smaller in scale, shape consumer demand and social norms”

Quick task for you now:
1) Please paste your revised thesis (one sentence) using the checklist above.
2) Tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (paragraph 2 about influencing government, or paragraph 3 about personal lifestyle choices) and paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence.

I’ll give focused feedback on your revised thesis and then we’ll revise the topic sentence so it links strongly to the thesis. Would you like to try the thesis revision now?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T13:08:24.257Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement Enter bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-11-30T13:16:10.101Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — let’s keep going. Step 1 is mandatory, so before we move on I need either your actual revised thesis sentence or your confirmation that the placeholder (“bla bla bla …”) stands in for a finished thesis you’re happy with.

Quick checklist to confirm your revised thesis (tick these mentally or tell me yes/no):
- Does it state your position clearly (e.g., “I partly agree” or “I agree to some extent”)?
- Does it preview the two main reasons in the order you’ll discuss them (citizen pressure on policy, and personal lifestyle choices)?
- Is the language confident and precise (no “I think,” “maybe,” or hedging)?
- Is it one concise sentence?

Please either:
- Paste your revised thesis here, OR
- Say “I confirm the thesis is finished” and briefly state how it answers the question (one short line).

Once you confirm the thesis, tell me which body paragraph you want to work on:
- Paragraph 2 (influence on government/policy), or
- Paragraph 3 (personal green habits/consumer pressure).

Then paste the current topic sentence for that paragraph. I will:
- Give brief feedback on how well it connects to the confirmed thesis,
- Offer focused guidance and short phrase-level suggestions to strengthen the link,
- Ask you to revise the topic sentence (you try it), and only after you revise, help you adjust the rest of the paragraph.

Which do you want to do? Paste the revised thesis (or confirm it) and the topic sentence you want to work on.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T13:16:20.693Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement Enter bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-11-30T13:25:20.072Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — let’s follow the three-step process. Step 1 is required, so I need your actual revised thesis (not the placeholder). Paste your one-sentence revised thesis here, or confirm it meets the checklist below.

Quick checklist for the thesis (please answer yes/no or paste the sentence):
- States your position clearly (e.g., “I partly agree” or “I agree to some extent”)?  
- Previews the two main reasons in the order you will discuss them (citizen pressure on policy; personal lifestyle/consumer influence)?  
- Uses confident, precise language (no “I think,” “maybe,” or hedging)?  
- Is one concise sentence?

If you prefer, paste your thesis now. Once you confirm you’re happy with it, tell me which body paragraph you want to work on:
- Paragraph 2: how individuals influence government/policy, or
- Paragraph 3: personal lifestyle choices and consumer pressure.

Then paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence. I will:
- Give brief feedback on how well it connects to your confirmed thesis,
- Suggest short phrase-level improvements (no full rewritten sentence),
- Ask you to try revising the topic sentence yourself before we edit the rest of the paragraph.

Which thesis version will we use, and which paragraph/topic sentence would you like to work on now?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T13:25:30.507Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-30T13:33:09.613Z

**Assistant:** Great — I can help revise the rest of a body paragraph, but first we need to complete Step 1 (thesis) and Step 2 (topic sentence). Please do both so we follow the required three-step process.

Quick checklist before you paste:
- Thesis: one clear sentence that states your position (e.g., “I partly agree”) and previews the two reasons in order (citizen pressure on policy; individual lifestyle/consumer influence). No hedging like “I think.”
- Topic sentence: the first sentence of the body paragraph you want to work on (pick paragraph 2 about influencing government, or paragraph 3 about personal lifestyle choices).

Please reply with:
1) Your revised thesis sentence (paste it here).
2) Which body paragraph you want to work on (paragraph 2 or paragraph 3).
3) The current topic sentence for that paragraph (paste it exactly as written).

After you post those three items I will:
- Give brief feedback on the thesis and confirm it’s ready,
- Help you strengthen the topic sentence so it links clearly to the thesis (I’ll give focused suggestions and short phrase options),
- Then guide you through revising the rest of the paragraph (questions and targeted advice) — but I will not provide a full rewritten sentence or paragraph.

Ready when you are!
