            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing the detailed assessment report and chat history! It’s clear you have already made significant progress on revising your thesis and at least one body paragraph, which is excellent.

To move forward and help you improve further, here is a focused plan based on the recommendations:

1. **Rewrite the First Body Paragraph**  
   Right now, this paragraph still has grammar and clarity issues, and it doesn’t fully align with your stronger, clearer thesis.  
   - Start with a clear topic sentence that reflects one of your thesis points (for example, how automation boosts productivity but may reduce jobs).  
   - Develop the paragraph by explaining your point clearly and linking it back to the thesis. Use simpler sentences if needed to avoid grammar mistakes.  
   - Consider including an example or comparison, even if hypothetical, to illustrate your point.  

2. **Grammar and Sentence-Level Editing**  
   After rewriting the first paragraph, do a careful proofread focusing on:  
   - Verb tense and subject-verb agreement  
   - Correct articles (a, an, the) and prepositions  
   - Avoid run-on sentences and sentence fragments  
   - Use shorter, clearer sentences when you’re unsure about complex structures  

3. **Add Concrete Evidence and Examples**  
   Both your revised paragraph and the new first paragraph would benefit from:  
   - More specific examples or brief references to studies/statistics if you have access  
   - Explaining *why* automation affects employment, productivity, and retraining needs—not just stating it  

4. **Active Collaboration in AI Sessions**  
   Next time you work with AI, try to:  
   - Answer clarifying questions from the assistant (e.g., your main goals, what prompt you are addressing).  
   - Share your thoughts on AI suggestions—accept, reject, or ask for alternatives.  
   - Iterate your revisions by posting new drafts and asking for specific feedback on each.  

If you want, I can help you now by:  
- Providing a model rewrite for your first body paragraph to match your revised thesis, or  
- Doing a grammar and clarity pass on that paragraph once you revise it yourself  

Just let me know how you’d like to continue!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 15/25 - The main claim is present (“More technology get involved into our market will undermine the world's employment prospects in the long term.”) but ideas are underdeveloped and reasoning is repetitive rather than supported with clear evidence or explanation.
- Organization: 17/25 - There is a basic essay structure (intro, body, conclusion) but paragraph unity and logical progression are weak; topic sentences are unclear and transitions are rough.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Vocabulary is limited and often imprecise (“product” for produce, “they employee”), reducing clarity.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Frequent grammatical errors and sentence-fragment issues hinder readability (e.g., “Automation, which is keep rising, replacing some work processes.”).
- **Original Essay Total: 61/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The thesis is much clearer and previews reasons: “I argue that automation poses significant threats to global employment in the long term due to increased productivity, job displacement in routine tasks, and the need for employee retraining.” This improves focus, though development and evidence remain fairly general.
- Organization: 21/25 - Paragraphing and the third paragraph's topic sentence were improved (“Many routine jobs are increasingly being replaced by automation…”). The flow between ideas is better, but the first body paragraph still contains structural and clarity issues.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Word choice is improved in the revised third paragraph (e.g., “monotonous processes,” “precision”), but some errors and awkward phrases remain in other paragraphs.
- Grammar: 18/25 - Grammar and sentence structure are improved in the revised paragraph and thesis, but the first body paragraph still contains many errors (e.g., “Automation, which is keep rising,”; “they can help industries to product more, being more efficiency”).
- **Revised Essay Total: 79/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +18 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clear, stronger thesis that previews three supporting points (productivity, routine job displacement, retraining needs).
  - One topic sentence rewritten for clarity and academic tone: “Many routine jobs are increasingly being replaced by automation, leading to job displacement in industries reliant on repetitive tasks.”
  - The corresponding body paragraph was substantially revised for coherence, explanation, and clearer comparison between automation and human workers (quotes: “Employees performing monotonous processes—such as measuring ingredients in a production line—often experience fatigue and decreased efficiency... In contrast, automation can execute these repetitive tasks with precision...”).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - First body paragraph remains largely unrevised and contains many grammar and clarity errors; it should be rewritten to align with the clearer thesis and third paragraph.
  - Evidence is still mostly hypothetical and anecdotal (production-line example). Adding data, citations, or more specific real-world examples would strengthen persuasiveness and content depth.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 3** (assistant initial plan, student: “let's revise the thesis statement”, assistant follow-up with questions and diagnostic)
- **Conversation Quality:** The AI provided a clear revision plan and diagnostic. Student engagement was minimal but directive (chose to revise the thesis). There is little evidence of iterative back-and-forth or critique of AI suggestions.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 - The chat is short (3 messages). The assistant provided a detailed plan, but the student contributed only one short turn indicating a focus, so depth is limited.
  - Evidence: After the assistant’s full plan, the student replied only “let's revise the thesis statement.”
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - The student accepted the AI’s structure and proceeded to the thesis task without recorded critique or evidence of evaluating alternative suggestions.
  - Evidence: The assistant offered multiple options and scaffolding; the student did not ask follow-up questions or challenge recommendations in the visible chat.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - There is a clear plan for a three-step revision process, but the chat shows only the initial step being requested. Some revision occurred in the essay, but the chat lacks documentation of multiple revision cycles.
  - Evidence: Assistant outlined Steps 1–3; student selected Step 1 in chat, and the revised essay shows completed Step 1 and Step 2/3 for one paragraph, but the chat does not document iterative cycles or student-reflective edits.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 6/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Successful uptake of AI guidance to produce a stronger thesis: “I argue that automation poses significant threats...” — shows the student can incorporate structural advice.
- Improved paragraph-level clarity in the revised routine-jobs paragraph, with better topic sentence and logical examples.
- Student followed a clear revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), indicating willingness to work with the AI scaffolding.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Grammar and sentence-level accuracy across the essay need focused editing; many sentences remain ungrammatical and reduce credibility.
- The first body paragraph was not revised and contains many of the same problems as the original draft — rewrite it to match the clearer thesis and improved paragraph 3.
- Provide stronger, more concrete evidence (statistics, studies, or clearer real-world examples) to support claims rather than relying on generalizations.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Needs Improvement - The student provided the essay but in chat did not specify course prompt alignment or revision priorities beyond “revise the thesis statement.” The assistant asked clarifying questions that the student did not answer.
- Strategic Planning: Good - The student followed the assistant’s staged plan (thesis → paragraph) and completed the steps for one paragraph.
- Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement - Little evidence the student critically assessed alternative AI suggestions; they accepted guidance without documented questioning.
- Independent Editing: Needs Improvement - The student completed revisions but relied on AI scaffolding and did not show multiple self-initiated editing cycles in the chat.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise the first body paragraph fully to match the improved thesis: create a clear topic sentence, add explanation linking back to thesis, and fix grammar. Example: begin with a concise claim, then illustrate and analyze.
2. Focus a separate pass on grammar and sentence-level editing: correct verb forms, subject-verb agreement, article use, and run-on sentences. Use short, clear sentences where complex structures cause errors.
3. In future AI sessions, engage more actively: respond to the assistant’s clarifying questions, evaluate proposed alternatives aloud, and run multiple iterative drafts in the chat so the revision process is fully documented.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student met the session objectives by revising the thesis and one body paragraph; however, only partial revision of the essay was achieved. The revised thesis meaningfully improves focus, and the rewritten paragraph demonstrates improved academic phrasing. Recommend advising the student to schedule a follow-up revision to address remaining grammar issues and rewrite the unchanged paragraph for coherence with the revised thesis.

**Essay: Does Automation Help or Hurt Global Employment in the
Long Term?**

More technology get involved into our market will undermine the world's employment prospects in the long term. 

Automation, which is keep rising, replacing some work processes. The industries will more prefer on using AI, technology, or some machines rather than hiring new employee, because of the cost. Although a machine or a coding program is expensive in a higher cost than paying salary to employee, they can help industries to product more, being more efficiency, automation can work on 24 hours, seven days. However, the human employee need time to rest or back home, they cannot work for the whole day. Therefore, the industries using automation can product and sell more goods than hiring employee. The more goods are sold, the more profit can earn by the industries. Thats why more industries chose not to hire more employee. 

Moreover, more jobs, which is repeating on doing a work, replaced by automation. Employment will feel tired or bored when they are keep doing some process in their production line, such as add a cup of into flours to make cakes, they employee will feel tired when they working for long hours, their production efficiency will be lower and they may make some mistakes because of their illness. Yet, the machines or other automation can finish this work perfectly, because they must follow the coding entered by the industries, the machines can input direct milliliter of milk into flour to make cakes. According to the benefit which automation can be more useful, specify on producing goods, that attract more companies using automation to finish some boring process. 

All in all, automations can be more efficient and be more smart in working process. They are having a big comparison between human employment, they have more talents, more power then employee. If human keep stepping on their comfort zone, or not to do something, for instance learn some new skills and explore more interests, automation will totally replace the global employment on one day, in long term. Industries can also create more opportunities to employee, try not to use machines or AI to undermine them so far. 

Revised:
**Essay: Does Automation Help or Hurt Global Employment in the
Long Term?**

I argue that automation poses significant threats to global employment in the long term due to increased productivity, job displacement in routine tasks, and the need for employee retraining.

Automation, which is keep rising, replacing some work processes. The industries will more prefer on using AI, technology, or some machines rather than hiring new employee, because of the cost. Although a machine or a coding program is expensive in a higher cost than paying salary to employee, they can help industries to product more, being more efficiency, automation can work on 24 hours, seven days. However, the human employee need time to rest or back home, they cannot work for the whole day. Therefore, the industries using automation can product and sell more goods than hiring employee. The more goods are sold, the more profit can earn by the industries. Thats why more industries chose not to hire more employee. 

Many routine jobs are increasingly being replaced by automation, leading to job displacement in industries reliant on repetitive tasks. Employees performing monotonous processes—such as measuring ingredients in a production line—often experience fatigue and decreased efficiency. Mistakes may occur due to exhaustion or illness, which further diminishes productivity. In contrast, automation can execute these repetitive tasks with precision, following programmed instructions without fatigue. This capability attracts many companies to adopt automation, as it allows for consistent and efficient production, ultimately driving profits while diminishing the need for human labor. 

All in all, automations can be more efficient and be more smart in working process. They are having a big comparison between human employment, they have more talents, more power then employee. If human keep stepping on their comfort zone, or not to do something, for instance learn some new skills and explore more interests, automation will totally replace the global employment on one day, in long term. Industries can also create more opportunities to employee, try not to use machines or AI to undermine them so far.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

**You:** let's revise the thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-12-02T07:13:40.959Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s get started. First, a few quick questions so I can help you in the way you want.

1) What is your main goal for this session? (Pick one or two: clarity of ideas, making the argument stronger, clearer structure, improving grammar/vocabulary, or something else.)
2) Which prompt are you answering here? The draft you gave is about automation and employment, but the course prompt in the instructions is about individual actions vs governments/corporations on climate change. Do you want to continue with the automation topic (your draft) or switch to the climate-change prompt?

Once you confirm those two things, I’ll give a short diagnostic of your essay against the rubric and we’ll agree which weaknesses to focus on (you asked to revise the thesis — that’s fine, but tell me if you also want help with clarity or grammar). Then we’ll move to Step 1.

Brief diagnostic (quick, based on your draft)
- Thesis & Argument: The essay’s main claim is present (automation will harm long-term employment) but it’s grammatically weak and vague. It does not preview the main reasons you will use to support the claim.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: You have an introduction and clear body-paragraph ideas, but topic sentences and paragraph unity are unclear and some ideas jump around.
- Evidence & Development: You use concrete examples (production line, milk/flour) but they are not clearly explained or connected to the main claim. More explanation and clearer linking to the thesis are needed.
- Vocabulary & Grammar: Frequent grammar and word-choice errors make many sentences hard to follow. This reduces the essay’s clarity and persuasiveness.

Which of these would you like to focus on during this session? Your options:
- A: Thesis clarity & strength (I can help you craft a precise, confident thesis that previews your main points).
- B: Thesis plus one paragraph’s topic sentence and content (full three-step process).
- C: Thesis plus grammar corrections (but note: we can only revise the thesis and one paragraph in this session).

Please confirm: 1) your goal(s), 2) which prompt we’re answering, and 3) which option (A, B, or C) you choose. 

Step 1 (Thesis) — next actions once you confirm
- I see your current thesis: “More technology get involved into our market will undermine the world's employment prospects in the long term.”
- Quick feedback on that sentence:
  - Grammar: “get involved into” is incorrect; use “become involved in” or “enter” or “are introduced to.” “Will undermine the world's employment prospects” is understandable but wordy.
  - Clarity & focus: It states a claim but doesn’t say “why” or preview the reasons. A stronger thesis answers the question “to what extent” (complete agreement, partial agreement, or disagreement) and signals the main points you will discuss (for example: productivity gains, job displacement in routine tasks, and the need for worker retraining/policy).
  - Tone: Use confident language; avoid hedging.

Before I suggest sentence-starters, would you like to try rewriting the thesis now based on that feedback? Try a 1–2 sentence thesis that:
- Clearly states whether you agree or disagree (fully or partly)
- Gives 2–3 reasons you’ll discuss (these will become paragraph topics)
- Uses precise, confident language

If you’d like a little help, here are short sentence-starters you can adapt (pick one to begin with and finish it in your own words):
- “I agree/disagree that automation will undermine global employment in the long term because…”
- “While automation increases productivity, I argue that it will (or will not) reduce long-term employment overall due to…”
- “Automation poses significant threats to employment—specifically in X, Y, and Z—unless A, B, and C happen.”

Would you like to try revising the thesis now? If you do, paste your new thesis and I’ll give targeted feedback and help you polish it. If you prefer, I can show one model thesis first — tell me which you want.
