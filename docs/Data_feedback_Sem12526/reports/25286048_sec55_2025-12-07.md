## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The draft addresses a relevant idea (automation and job loss) and includes a concrete example (AI robots in manufacturing), but ideas are underdeveloped and the claim is unclear. Example: "This technological undermine global employment prospects in long term." is both unclear and grammatically weak.
- Organization: 15/25 - Paragraphing is present but the logical progression is weak; topic sentence is not clear and sentences run together (run-on structure). The paragraph lacks a clear preview of points.
- Vocabulary: 16/25 - Basic domain vocabulary (automation, manufacturing) appears but word choice is imprecise ("mark types") and phrasing is awkward.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Multiple grammatical errors (subject–verb agreement, articles, run-ons) impede clarity. Example: "This technological undermine..." and "this variation highlight" are ungrammatical.
- **Original Essay Total: 62/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised version offers a clear claim and previews reasons for disruption ("differences in technological adoption, industrial structures, and labor market dynamics") and adds a concise conclusion connecting implications and policy need.
- Organization: 21/25 - Paragraph structure is improved: a clear topic sentence appears ("While the adoption of AI-driven automation is advancing..."), followed by explanation and example, and a concluding sentence that restates the trajectory. Flow is generally logical.
- Vocabulary: 21/25 - Word choice is more precise ("AI-driven automation," "labor market dynamics," "job displacement"), demonstrating improved topical language and variety.
- Grammar: 21/25 - Major grammatical issues have been corrected; sentences are mostly accurate and more fluent. Some redundancy and slight verbosity remain but do not significantly impede comprehension.
- **Revised Essay Total: 84/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +22 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clear, grammatical thesis: changed from "This technological undermine global employment prospects in long term." to "This technology undermines global employment prospects in the long term." and then to a fuller thesis that specifies "AI-driven automation" and previews reasons.
  - Stronger paragraph topic sentence and structure: the paragraph now begins with a clear topic sentence: "While the adoption of AI-driven automation is advancing at different paces across economies, it will ultimately disrupt long-term global employment prospects..."
  - Improved language accuracy and precision: corrected subject–verb agreement, clearer noun phrases (e.g., "automation-driven" → "AI-driven automation"), and better use of domain terms ("labor market dynamics," "job displacement").
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The revised submission includes redundant or duplicated text (the original paragraph appears appended after the revised text), suggesting incomplete cleanup — remove duplicated material for a polished draft.
  - Evidence could be strengthened with specific data, citations, or a more detailed example (e.g., a brief statistic or named company/industry example) to support the claim more convincingly.
  - Limited engagement with counterarguments or mitigation strategies — the conclusion mentions policy and workforce adaptation but could be expanded with specific policy examples or proposed worker supports (retraining, education).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 12 messages (assistant and student back-and-forth)**
- **Conversation Quality:** Moderately focused and structured. The assistant provided a clear, stepwise revision workflow (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), diagnostic feedback, and models; the student followed the workflow, chose to keep the automation topic (A), and submitted revised sentences and paragraph text. The interaction shows purposeful guidance and student compliance, with some iterative revision.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Developing. Evidence: 12 exchanges produced a substantive discussion of thesis, organization, and language. The assistant provided rubric-style diagnostics and stepwise guidance (assistant opening: "Step 1: Revise your thesis statement..." and later detailed guidance). However, the chat did not reach the high volume or multi-layered depth associated with "Excellent" (no extended exploration of alternate arguments, evidence integration, or multiple full revision cycles).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 - Developing. Evidence: The student followed the assistant's structured prompts and produced revisions, but there is little explicit critique or selective rejection of AI suggestions. The student accepted the topic A and implemented the recommended thesis/paragraph changes rather than arguing for alternate approaches or deeply questioning suggestions.
- **Refining Process**: 4/5 - Proficient. Evidence: There is a clear iterative process: assistant sets the three-step workflow, asks the student to try a revision, provides targeted feedback, and the student submits a revised thesis and paragraph. At least two revision cycles are evident (initial thesis → assistant feedback → student rewrite → assistant feedback). The process is purposeful though could include more cycles and polishing.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 10/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear improvement in thesis clarity and paragraph-level organization (evidence: revised thesis and topic sentence quoted above).
- Effective use of AI guidance to produce grammatically improved text and sharper vocabulary (e.g., "AI-driven automation," "job displacement").
- Student followed a structured revision workflow and provided substantive revised text after prompts, demonstrating receptivity and ability to apply feedback.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Clean up the final document to remove duplicated original text appended to the revised version and ensure final coherence.
- Bolster evidence by adding specific data, named examples, or citations to substantiate claims and make the argument more persuasive.
- Increase critical engagement with AI suggestions (e.g., ask for alternatives, propose counterexamples, or test different thesis formulations) to develop independent editorial judgment.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided a draft and chose topic A, giving enough context for targeted feedback; however, they did not explicitly confirm revision priorities in the chat when prompted, which slightly limited clarity.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student and assistant agreed on a clear 3-step revision plan and followed it; the student executed the plan.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Developing/Good - The student applied suggestions but showed limited explicit critique or selection among AI proposals.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The student produced revisions themselves (rewrote thesis and paragraph), showing independent editing ability, though final polishing remains needed.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Before finalizing, perform a cleanup pass to remove duplicated or outdated text and ensure the revised version is the only text submitted.
2. Strengthen the argument with at least one concrete, cited example or statistic to support claims about job displacement and differing impacts across economies.
3. During AI-assisted revision, experiment with multiple alternative thesis/topic-sentence formulations and explicitly evaluate which best fits your intended argument to develop critical selection skills.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student clearly benefited from the guided workflow and produced measurable improvements between drafts (+22 points). Encourage the student to incorporate specific evidence and to do one more revision cycle focused on concision and removal of duplicated content.
- The chat shows good use of the assistant as a coach; remind students to explicitly confirm revision priorities when asked and to engage more critically with AI suggestions (e.g., request alternative phrasing or probe for weaknesses in recommended wording).

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
  This technological undermine global employment prospects in long term.
    A combination of situations between different mark types this variation highlight the different levels of automation driven employment disruption between developed and emerging economies which can be attributed to differences in technological adoption, industrial structures, and labor market dynamics.
  Although emerging markets such as Vietnam and Mainland China currently have low levels of automation, they will still face long-term challenges from this trend. As AI technology continues to spread globally, more industries in these regions will likely adopt automation to increase efficiency. For example, some manufacturing plants in emerging economies have already begun using AI robots for assembly and quality inspection, reducing the demand for low-skilled workers. With technology being adopted faster over time, more people in these markets could gradually lose their jobs.
   

Revised:
 This technology undermines global employment prospects in the long term.
     While the adoption of AI-driven automation is advancing at different paces across economies, it will ultimately disrupt long-term global employment prospects, regardless of a country's current level of technological development.  
    The extent and timing of this disruption, however, vary between developed and emerging economies due to differences in technological adoption, industrial structures, and labor market dynamics. For instance, in emerging markets such as Vietnam and Mainland China, automation levels are still relatively low. Nonetheless, as AI technology becomes more accessible and affordable globally, these regions are increasingly integrating automation to enhance productivity. Already, some manufacturing plants in emerging economies have begun deploying AI robots for tasks such as assembly and quality inspection, which reduces reliance on low-skilled labor. As this trend accelerates, even countries that currently rely heavily on labor-intensive industries will face gradual but significant job displacement.
   In conclusion, although the pace of impact may differ, the long-term trajectory points toward widespread employment disruption across both developed and emerging markets as automation continues to permeate global industries. This suggests that, without proactive policy and workforce adaptation, AI automation poses a sustained threat to job stability worldwide.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-07T05:55:35.889Z

**You:** Revise my paper to make it more fluent and natural.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:15:10.770Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I can help you revise this, but first we need to agree targets and diagnose the draft so our revision is focused and useful. Quick questions so we can start:

1) What are your top goals right now? (You already said “more fluent and coherent” — do you also want help with grammar, logical clarity, staying on the assignment, or something else?)

2) Which of these would you like us to focus on in this session? I can only revise three things in our workflow: the thesis statement, one body paragraph’s topic sentence, and that paragraph’s supporting sentences. Pick up to two priorities from these options:
- Make the essay respond to the assignment (task alignment)
- Improve the thesis (clarity, strength, preview)
- Improve paragraph organization and unity
- Fix language (grammar and word choice) for fluency

Diagnostic feedback (quick, based on the rubric categories) — this will help you choose:

- Thesis & Argument
  - Major problem: the current thesis (“This technological undermine global employment prospects in long term.”) is ungrammatical and unclear.
  - Bigger issue: the essay topic you drafted (AI/automation and employment) does not match the assignment prompt about individual actions vs government/corporate action on climate change. If the assignment is the climate-change prompt, we need to reorient the thesis and argument to answer that question.

- Organization
  - The paragraph lacks a clear, grammatical topic sentence that connects to a clear thesis.
  - Sentences include run-on phrasing and unclear transitions; unity is weak.

- Evidence & Development
  - You have a relevant example (AI robots in manufacturing) which is promising, but it needs clearer explanation and stronger linking to the main claim.

- Language Use
  - Several grammar issues (subject-verb agreement, article use, word order) and awkward phrasing reduce fluency.
  - Some sentences are fragments or run-ons and need simplification.

Strengths
- You show an understanding of a topical issue (automation and labor) and include a concrete example — good raw material to develop.
- You generally attempt to explain causes (technological adoption, industrial structure).

Before we move to Step 1 (thesis), please tell me:
- Do you want to keep the current topic (automation and employment) or do you want to rewrite the essay so it answers the climate-change prompt? (We must pick one.)
- Which two priorities from the list above would you like me to help with now?

Once you confirm, we’ll begin Step 1. I’ll ask you to share or try rewriting your thesis (I’ll guide you), then we’ll revise one paragraph’s topic sentence and then that paragraph’s supporting sentences. Would you like to start?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:15:30.127Z

**You:** My thesis statement is  "This technological undermine global employment prospects in long term."

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:17:03.039Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a helpful start. Before we revise, we need to agree targets and confirm the focus so the work is useful.

Quick points about your current thesis: "This technological undermine global employment prospects in long term."
- It’s ungrammatical (subject–verb agreement, article/word choice) and unclear.
- More importantly: your draft is about AI/automation and jobs, but the assignment prompt you gave asks about individual actions vs governments/corporations on climate change. We must choose one focus.

Please answer two quick questions so we can proceed:

1) Topic decision (choose one)
- A: Keep your current topic (automation and employment) and continue with that essay (note: this will not directly answer the climate-change prompt).
- B: Switch to the assignment topic about individual actions vs governments/corporations on climate change (we will rewrite the thesis/argument to answer that prompt).

2) Which up to two revision priorities do you want to focus on in this session? (You can pick up to two.)
- Make the essay respond to the assignment (task alignment)
- Improve the thesis (clarity, strength, preview)
- Improve paragraph organization and unity
- Fix language (grammar and word choice) for fluency

My recommendation (based on your goals: more fluent/coherent; language is awkward):
- If you choose B (switch to the climate prompt): pick Task alignment + Improve the thesis.
- If you choose A (keep automation topic): pick Improve the thesis + Fix language.

Diagnostic feedback (short, so you can decide)
- Thesis & Argument: Thesis is unclear and doesn’t answer the assignment prompt. Needs a clear claim and preview of main points.
- Organization: Paragraphs lack clear topic sentences tied to a thesis; there are run-on phrases and weak transitions.
- Evidence & Development: You have a concrete example (AI in manufacturing) — good — but it needs clearer explanation and stronger links to the claim.
- Language Use: Problems with grammar (subject–verb agreement, articles), word order, and some run-ons that reduce fluency.

Next step (Step 1: Thesis Revision) will start once you confirm the two choices above. I’ll ask you to try a revised thesis first and give guidance. Would you like to:
- A or B for topic? 
- Which two priorities do you choose?

If you already want me to suggest a corrected thesis for the automation topic right away, I can propose a model — but I’d prefer you tell me which topic and which priorities first.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:17:14.706Z

**You:** A

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:19:27.939Z

**Assistant:** Good — thanks for choosing A (keep the automation/employment topic). Before we begin Step 1, please pick up to two revision priorities from this list (tell me which you choose):
- Improve the thesis (clarity, strength, preview)
- Fix language (grammar and word choice) for fluency
- Improve paragraph organization and unity
- Make the essay respond to the assignment (task alignment)

My recommendation for your goals (more fluent and coherent) is: Improve the thesis + Fix language. Do you want to go with that?

Once you confirm the two priorities, we’ll start Step 1.

Step 1 — Thesis revision (next)
- Share your current thesis again (you already have: “This technological undermine global employment prospects in long term.”). I’ll give quick feedback, then I’d like you to try rewriting it once before I offer a model.
- Quick guidance for a stronger thesis:
  - Make a clear, specific claim about automation’s effect on employment.
  - Preview 2–3 main reasons or points you will use (e.g., differences in adoption rates, industry structures, skills mismatch).
  - Use precise, confident language and correct grammar (no hedging).
  - Keep it one sentence, direct.

Would you like to try revising the thesis now? If so, type your new sentence and I’ll give feedback.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:19:39.174Z

**You:** A combination of situations between different mark types this variation highlight the different levels of automation driven employment disruption between developed and emerging economies which can be attributed to differences in technological adoption, industrial structures, and labor market dynamics.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:21:58.322Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is good work trying to describe a complex idea. Before we begin Step 1, quick confirmation so we follow the agreed workflow:

1) Topic: You want to keep the automation-and-employment topic (A)?  
2) Priorities: Do you want to focus on (a) Improve the thesis and (b) Fix language for fluency? (These two are my recommended pair.)

Please answer yes/no to each. Once you confirm, we’ll move into Step 1.

Quick feedback on your sentence (“A combination of situations between different mark types this variation highlight the different levels of automation driven employment disruption between developed and emerging economies which can be attributed to differences in technological adoption, industrial structures, and labor market dynamics.”)

- Main issues (brief):
  - Grammar: it’s a run-on with subject–verb problems (“this variation highlight” should be “this variation highlights” or rephrased).
  - Clarity: phrases like “different mark types” and “this variation” are unclear — I can’t tell what you mean by “mark types.”
  - Word choice and punctuation: missing hyphen in “automation-driven”; you need commas or splitting into shorter clauses.
  - Purpose: this line feels like an explanation sentence rather than a clear thesis that makes a claim and previews main points.

- What a stronger thesis should do here:
  - Make a clear, confident claim about the impact of automation on employment.
  - Preview 2–3 main reasons you will discuss (e.g., different adoption rates, industrial structure, skills mismatch or labor market flexibility).
  - Be one clear sentence, grammatically correct, and specific.

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Try one sentence that follows this pattern:
- [Claim about automation’s effect on employment] + because/for three reasons: [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].

Example structure (don’t copy—just a pattern): “Automation will significantly reduce employment opportunities worldwide because of X, Y, and Z.” — now try your own version using your three main points.

Type your new thesis and I’ll give focused feedback. If you prefer, I can show a model after you try.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:22:15.484Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for all that text. Let’s set clear targets and diagnose before we start revising.

Quick negotiatation (two questions)
1) What is your primary goal for this session? From what you wrote, I see “more fluent and coherent” plus grammar and logic problems. Do you confirm those as your goals, or add anything (e.g., stronger argument, task alignment)?
2) Which up to two revision priorities do you want us to focus on now? (Pick up to two)
- Improve the thesis (clarity, strength, preview)
- Fix language (grammar and word choice) for fluency
- Improve paragraph organization and unity
- Make the essay respond to the assignment (task alignment)

My recommendation for your goals and draft: Keep the automation topic and choose Improve the thesis + Fix language. Do you agree? (Yes / No / change choice)

Brief diagnostic feedback (based on the rubric)
- Thesis & Argument: Current thesis versions have grammar problems and are a bit vague (“this technology” is unclear). Also they don’t preview the specific reasons you’ll discuss. We need one clear, confident sentence that states your claim and previews 2–3 reasons.
- Organization: Paragraphs lack a strong topic sentence explicitly linked to a clear thesis. Some sentences are long and need clearer transitions.
- Evidence & Development: You have a useful concrete example (AI robots in manufacturing) — good — but it should be more tightly connected to the paragraph’s main claim and explained briefly.
- Language Use: Frequent grammar issues (subject–verb agreement, articles, run-ons) and awkward phrasing reduce fluency.

Please confirm the two priorities above before we begin Step 1.

Step 1 — Thesis statement revision (we’ll do this now once you confirm)
- Share the thesis you want to work on. You already wrote: “This technology undermines global employment prospects in the long term.” That’s a fine starting point but needs improvement: it’s a little vague (“this technology” → “AI-driven automation”), and it doesn’t preview your main reasons.
- Quick guidance (one-sentence pattern to follow): Claim + because (or due to) + three brief reasons. Example pattern (do not copy word-for-word): “AI-driven automation will significantly reduce employment opportunities worldwide because of differences in adoption rates, industrial structures, and skills mismatches.”
- Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Please type one sentence that:
  - names the technology clearly (e.g., “AI-driven automation”),
  - makes a confident claim about employment,
  - previews 2–3 reasons you’ll discuss (short phrases).

Try one revision now; I’ll give focused feedback and then we’ll confirm it before moving to Step 2. Would you like to try revising the thesis?
