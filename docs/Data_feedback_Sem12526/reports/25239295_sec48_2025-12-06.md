            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for your patience and collaboration throughout this revision process! Here is a concise summary of your current progress and next steps based on your last message.

---

### Summary of Completed Work:
- **Thesis:** Confirmed and kept your chosen version:  
  *“I believe that automation will ultimately increase global employment due to the rise of new industries, relocation of manufacturing and demand for creative jobs.”*  
  (Note: I can help you remove "I believe" later for a stronger academic tone, if you like.)

- **Paragraph revised:** The second body paragraph, with improvements to the topic sentence and supporting sentences for clarity, grammar, logical flow, and word choice.  
  Key highlights:  
  - Linked the topic sentence clearly to the thesis mechanisms.  
  - Clarified the role of new industries and maintenance jobs.  
  - Corrected relocation direction and phrasing (“manufacturing may relocate to developing countries,” “receive investment and technology transfer”).  
  - Expanded on why AI won’t replace all human jobs, referencing Moravec’s paradox and the need for professional oversight.

- **Conclusion:** Original conclusion remains, with the possibility of light editing upon your choice.

---

### Recommendations for Next Steps

You can choose one of the following options to continue refining your essay:

**a) Revise the first body paragraph (counterargument) topic sentence.**  
- Goal: Frame job losses as short-term/sector-specific to strengthen logical flow into your rebuttal paragraph.  
- I can guide you in crafting a precise, well-linked topic sentence.

**b) Edit the thesis to remove “I believe” for a more confident, academic tone.**  
- This is optional since you chose to keep it, but it will improve formality and clarity.

**c) Perform sentence-level grammar and word choice edits in the revised second body paragraph (or elsewhere).**  
- This involves polishing articles, prepositions, verb forms, and word choice for maximum clarity and correctness.

---

### Please let me know which option you prefer to move forward with next!  
If you want, I can also help you with quick examples or further explanation for any choice.

Looking forward to your reply!

## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The original presents a relevant position (automation and jobs) but ideas are thinly developed, vague, and rely on unsupported assertions (e.g., “research has found” with no citation). Shows basic awareness but limited depth.
- Organization: 17/25 - Structure (intro, body, conclusion) is present, but paragraphs jump between points and transitions are weak, reducing logical progression.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Frequent incorrect word choices and nonstandard forms (“retall,” “lossing,” “cheap labors”) show limited precision and variety.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 14/25 - Frequent spelling, verb-form, article, and agreement errors that sometimes impede clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 63/100**

Evidence: original thesis phrasing “This essay will explain why automation will eventually increase global employment opportunities but not decrease it.” Body sentences such as “cheap labors' skill is not needed” and “Human may loss all job opportunities” illustrate vocabulary and grammar problems.

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised draft presents a clearer claim and a better-developed set of reasons (new industries; relocation; demand for creative/oversight roles). The rebuttal and support are more coherent and connected to the thesis, though evidence remains general rather than specific or sourced.
- Organization: 20/25 - Paragraphing and logical links improved, particularly the revised body paragraph that now clearly ties to the thesis. Some transitions and the first body paragraph still need strengthening to better prepare the rebuttal.
- Vocabulary: 19/25 - Word choice and register improved (e.g., “low-skilled workers,” “vocational training,” “technology transfer”), but some awkward phrases and remaining errors persist (title phrasing, some article use).
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 18/25 - Noticeable improvements in sentence structure and tense consistency in the revised paragraph; however, residual errors remain elsewhere (intro and first body paragraph still show mistakes).
- **Revised Essay Total: 78/100**

Evidence: revised thesis: “I believe that automation will ultimately increase global employment due to the rise of new industries, relocation of manufacturing and demand for creative jobs.” Revised paragraph topic sentence: “However, automation is already creating new job opportunities by spawning new industries, shifting production to different regions, and increasing demand for creative and oversight roles.” The revised body paragraph shows improved phrasing: “the maintenance and repair of automated machinery requires technicians, engineers, and support staff.”

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +15 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis clarified and now previews the essay’s main mechanisms (new industries, relocation, demand for creative/oversight roles).
  - One body paragraph (the paragraph arguing automation creates jobs) was substantially rewritten for clarity, unity, grammar, and logical linkage to the thesis.
  - Topic sentence for that paragraph is now specific and signals mechanisms, improving coherence and transition from counterargument to rebuttal.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Strengthen the counterargument paragraph’s topic sentence to explicitly frame job losses as short-term/sector-specific to improve the essay’s overall logic (assistant recommended this but the student has not fully completed it).
  - Add concrete evidence, specific data, or named studies/examples to support claims (e.g., figures for job creation in automation industries).
  - Eliminate remaining non-academic phrasing and residual grammar errors in the introduction and first body paragraph (e.g., title grammar, “retell” → “retail”, “I believe” optional removal for stronger academic tone).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges:** 31 messages (series of iterative student–assistant exchanges covering thesis revision, topic-sentence work, and paragraph rewriting).
- **Conversation Quality:** Extensive, stepwise guidance. The assistant provided a clear revision plan and multiple targeted suggestions; the student participated by posting drafts, selecting options, and confirming a plan. The interaction demonstrates iterative revision with focused learning targets (structure/logical flow and grammar/word choice).

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - Evidence: 31 exchanges, repeated cycles addressing thesis, topic sentences, and paragraph-level revision; assistant used a structured three-step process and student followed through across multiple turns.
  - Example: Assistant outlined Step 1–3 revision workflow and guided iterations; student posted successive thesis drafts and paragraph text (see messages where the student pasted revised thesis and paragraph).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - The student made some independent edits and choices (attempted thesis rewrites, selected which thesis version to keep), and selectively accepted suggestions (e.g., kept “I believe” although assistant advised dropping it). However, there was limited recorded explicit critique or detailed justification for accepting/rejecting specific AI edits beyond choosing options.
  - Example: Student repeatedly revised the thesis and explicitly chose option (b) to keep a version with “I believe,” showing selective acceptance rather than blanket acceptance.
- **Refining Process**: 4/5 - The revision shows clear iteration: multiple thesis drafts, discussion and revision of topic sentences, and a rewritten body paragraph provided by the assistant and integrated into the essay. The student elected to move through planned steps, although in some cases the assistant produced final rewrites that the student accepted rather than iteratively producing every sentence themselves.
  - Evidence: Series of iterations in chat culminating in the assistant’s rewrite of the second body paragraph and the full revised essay.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 13/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear stance and argument structure: The student maintained a consistent thesis and organized the essay around mechanisms (evidence: final thesis and the revised paragraph topic sentence).
- Willingness to iterate and follow a guided revision plan: The student engaged in a multi-step process, posted multiple versions, and accepted targeted improvements (31 exchanges).
- Improved clarity in the revised paragraph: The assistant’s rewrite (accepted by the student) improved grammar, flow, and specificity for the key support paragraph.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Provide stronger, specific evidence: incorporate statistics, reports, or named studies to support claims about job creation and relocation.
- Finish revising the counterargument paragraph: explicitly frame job losses as short-term/sector-specific to strengthen logical flow into the rebuttal.
- Continue sentence-level editing across the whole essay: remove residual errors (spelling, articles, prepositions) and adjust register (consider removing “I believe” for a more academic tone).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student stated revision targets early (structure/logical flow; grammar/word choice) and responded to the assistant’s prompts about goals.
  - Evidence: student selected focus areas and confirmed which paragraph to revise.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student followed a clear plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) and stayed on task.
  - Evidence: repeated confirmation of steps and selection of paragraph A/B and final choice to work on the paragraph supporting the thesis.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Proficient/Developing - The student made selections and attempted own rewrites but relied on assistant-provided rewrites for some final wording; some acceptance was selective rather than deeply critiqued.
  - Evidence: student kept “I believe” despite assistant advice and accepted the assistant’s rewritten paragraph.
- **Independent Editing**: Developing - The student made several independent revisions (thesis attempts) but relied on the assistant to finalize the paragraph rewrite; more independent sentence-level edits would further demonstrate editing skill.
  - Evidence: student’s own thesis rewrites and acceptance of assistant revisions.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Add concrete, cited evidence and examples: include brief statistics, named studies, or specific industry examples (with a one-sentence source attribution) to support claims.
2. Revise the counterargument paragraph to explicitly frame job losses as short-term or sector-specific and improve transitions that lead into the revised rebuttal paragraph.
3. Perform a final pass focused solely on sentence-level accuracy (spelling, articles, prepositions) across the whole essay and consider removing hedging language (“I believe”) for a stronger academic voice.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student demonstrated steady engagement with the AI assistant and completed the instructor-assigned three-step revision tasks (thesis, topic sentence, and one body paragraph).
- The AI-assisted rewrite improved clarity and structure in one key paragraph, but the overall essay still needs targeted sentence-level editing and stronger evidence to reach higher academic standards.
- Consider encouraging the student to practice independently producing at least one full paragraph revision before accepting an assistant rewrite, to strengthen independent editing skills.

Automation blesses global employment prospect

  In globalised world, automation is promoted in every industries such as agriculture and even retall. The concern about lossing job due to it has been discussed nowdays. This essay will explain why automation will eventually increase global employment opportunities but not decrease it.
  Obviously, many low-skilled and cheap labors started to be replaced by machines now. For example, many factories use machine to process meat like KFC. Through using machines, cheap labors' skill is not needed. Furthermore, the industry in marking common automatic machines is also automatic and thus costs fewer. This leads to the trend of replacing labor with automation dramatically. Finally, the rise of AI causes a terrible sence imaged by many people: Will all staffs replaced by smart robots? It seems that AI can at least replace programmers as AI reasoning is more efficient than human. Human may loss all job opportunities.
  However, automation is actually increasing job opportunities. First and foremost, automation creates new industries. The maintainence of automatic machines required a huge amount of labor. They can act like security observers with low education background. Besides, the job market is not explored. There are many developing countries which have a lot of cheap labors. As developed countries lack of cheap labors, the industry of making automatic machines can be relocated to developed countries. To recruit required labors, developing countries can receive invention from the rich countries and their educational and professional industries can rise significantly. Last but not least, Ai will not replace all human jobs. Research has found that AI is good at reasoning but not recognition and creation. Thus, job needs creativity is safe. There are AI bias too. As a result, a specific professional industry is required to check and correct them. Automation is building more and more chance in global employment prospects.
  In conclusion, admittedly, there are people who lose their job in short-term because of automation. Nevertheless, automation starts to provide a lot of new jobs for people. Automation will utimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.

Revised:
Automation blesses global employment prospect

  In globalized world, automation is promoted in every industries such as agriculture and even retell. The concern about losing job due to it has been discussed nowadays. I believe that automation will ultimately increase global employment due to the rise of new industries, relocation of manufacturing and demand for creative jobs. 
  Obviously, many low-skilled workers are currently being displaced by automation, especially in routine manufacturing and processing roles. For example, many factories use machine to process meat like KFC. Through using machines, cheap labors’ skill is not needed. Furthermore, the industry in marking common automatic machines is also automatic and thus costs fewer. This leads to the trend of replacing labor with automation dramatically. Finally, the rise of AI causes a terrible sense imaged by many people: Will all staffs replaced by smart robots? For example, AI can replace low-level programmers as AI reasoning is more efficient than human. Human may loss all job opportunities as AI is smarter than us. 
  However, automation is already creating new job opportunities by spawning new industries, shifting production to different regions, and increasing demand for creative and oversight roles. First and foremost, automation creates new industries that require workers to build, operate, and service machines. For example, the maintenance and repair of automated machinery requires technicians, engineers, and support staff, creating many new positions. Some of these roles—such as machine operators, maintenance technicians, and monitoring staff—can be filled by workers with vocational training rather than a university degree. Additionally, production and assembly for automation equipment often shift toward developing countries; as manufacturing relocates, local economies receive new investment and technology transfer, which stimulates growth in education, vocational training, and related service industries. Finally, AI will not replace all human jobs: Moravec’s paradox suggests that, although AI can perform high-level reasoning tasks, it struggles with perception, fine-motor skills, and many creative or social tasks. AI systems can also reflect biases or make errors, so specialized professionals are needed to audit, correct, and regulate these systems. 
  In these ways, automation is expanding diverse employment opportunities worldwide. In conclusion, admittedly, there are people who lose their job in short-term because of automation. Nevertheless, automation starts to provide a lot of new jobs for people. Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-06T13:52:24.166Z

**You:** Let's revise thesis statement.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:20:54.642Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s do this carefully and step by step.

First, a quick check so I meet your needs: what do you want to improve most today? (Pick one or two.)
- clarity of meaning
- strength of argument (thesis, previews, claims)
- structure and logical flow
- grammar and word choice
- academic style and tone

Tell me which you want to focus on during this session. After you choose, I’ll give a short diagnostic of your essay against the rubric categories and list a few weak points you can choose from to work on. Then we’ll revise the thesis.

If you’re ready to start revising the thesis now, tell me which targets you choose.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:21:06.135Z

**You:** structure and logical flow
grammar and word choice

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:24:27.943Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing your targets: structure and logical flow, plus grammar and word choice. That’s a helpful focus.

Before we begin revising, a quick diagnostic (short and clear) using the rubric categories most relevant to your targets:

Strengths
- Clear overall position: your essay consistently argues that automation ultimately increases employment.
- Basic paragraph structure (intro, body, conclusion) is present.
- You include examples and counterarguments, which shows awareness of different perspectives.

Areas to improve (diagnosis tied to your chosen targets)
- Thesis & Argument: The thesis states your position but is weakly worded and doesn’t preview the main reasons. Phrases like “This essay will explain…” and the double negative (“increase … but not decrease it”) reduce clarity and force.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Topic sentences and paragraph transitions are often unclear or loose. Some paragraphs jump between ideas (e.g., factory automation → AI replacing programmers → general job loss) without smooth logical links.
- Evidence & Development: Examples are vague (e.g., “many factories,” “research has found”) and need clearer explanation and connection to claims.
- Vocabulary & Grammar: Frequent spelling, article, pluralization, and word-choice errors (e.g., “retall,” “lossing,” “staffs,” “Ai”) make sentences harder to follow. Sentence structure is often repetitive and sometimes confusing.

Choose the specific issues you want to work on in this session
(Please pick 1–2 from this list so we stay focused — you already chose two broad areas, so try to pick matching specific items.)
- Improve the thesis so it’s clear, direct, and previews 2–3 main reasons.
- Strengthen link between thesis and topic sentences (choose one paragraph to focus on).
- Improve one paragraph’s coherence and flow (transitions, unity of ideas).
- Fix sentence-level grammar and word choice in that paragraph (spelling, articles, verb forms).

Which of these would you like to focus on now? Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 1: thesis revision.

Step 1 prep (when you’re ready)
- Please paste your current thesis statement here (or confirm: “This essay will explain why automation will eventually increase global employment opportunities but not decrease it.”).
- Try rewriting the thesis now, aiming to:
  - State your position directly (no “This essay will…”).
  - Preview 2–3 reasons you will develop.
  - Use confident, precise language.

Want a quick checklist to help you rewrite? Try these prompts:
- What exactly do I claim about automation and jobs (short sentence)?
- Why will this happen? List 2–3 clear reasons (e.g., new industries; maintenance and monitoring jobs; relocation of manufacturing; creative jobs safe).
- Combine into one sentence: claim + preview.

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:24:42.187Z

**You:** I correct some errors.                                                                                                                                                        Automation blesses global employment prospect

  In globalized world, automation is promoted in every industries such as agriculture and even retell. The concern about losing job due to it has been discussed nowadays. However, I firmly believe that automation will eventually increase global employment opportunities undoubtedly.
  Obviously, many low-skilled and cheap labors started to be replaced by machines now. For example, many factories use machine to process meat like KFC. Through using machines, cheap labors' skill is not needed. Furthermore, the industry in marking common automatic machines is also automatic and thus costs fewer. This leads to the trend of replacing labor with automation dramatically. Finally, the rise of AI causes a terrible sense imaged by many people: Will all staffs replaced by smart robots? For example, AI can replace low-level programmers as AI reasoning is more efficient than human. Human may loss all job opportunities as AI is smarter than us.

**Assistant:** Nice — thank you. Your choice of targets (structure and logical flow, plus grammar and word choice) is clear and helpful.

Brief diagnostic (focused on those targets)
- Strengths: Your position is consistent across the essay and you include counterpoints and examples. Paragraphs follow a basic intro-body-conclusion shape.
- Priority problems for our targets:
  - Thesis: short, slightly awkward, and doesn’t preview the main reasons you will argue.
  - Logical flow: some paragraphs jump between ideas (e.g., factory automation → AI replacing programmers → general job loss) without clear links.
  - Sentence-level grammar and word choice: many spelling, article, plural, and word-choice mistakes that reduce clarity.

Now please pick 1–2 specific revision tasks from this list (we’ll focus on only these):
- Improve the thesis so it’s clear, direct, and previews 2–3 main reasons.
- Strengthen the link between the thesis and topic sentences (choose one paragraph).
- Improve one paragraph’s coherence and flow (transitions, unity).
- Fix sentence-level grammar and word choice in that paragraph (spelling, articles, verb forms).

Which would you like to work on now? (I recommend starting with the thesis plus one paragraph — that gives the biggest improvement.)

Step 1 — Thesis revision (ready when you are)
- Please confirm the thesis you want to revise. I see these candidates in your draft:
  - “This essay will explain why automation will eventually increase global employment opportunities but not decrease it.”
  - “However, I firmly believe that automation will eventually increase global employment opportunities undoubtedly.”
- Which one should we revise, or paste another version if you have one?

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using this quick checklist?
- State your claim directly (no “This essay will…”).
- Preview 2–3 clear reasons you will discuss (e.g., new industries, maintenance/monitoring jobs, relocation and skills development, creative/oversight roles).
- Use confident, precise language.

Try to write one sentence. When you post your attempt, I’ll give focused feedback and help you refine it. If you prefer, I can show 1–2 model thesis sentences after you try one. Which do you want?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:46:01.367Z

**You:** Let's move on to next step

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:50:01.042Z

**Assistant:** Great — we’ll start Step 1 (thesis revision).

Quick reminder of your targets: structure & logical flow, and grammar & word choice.

Please paste the exact thesis you want to revise, or confirm which of these two we should work on:
- “This essay will explain why automation will eventually increase global employment opportunities but not decrease it.”
- “However, I firmly believe that automation will eventually increase global employment opportunities undoubtedly.”

Now try to rewrite the thesis in one clear sentence that:
- States your position directly (no “This essay will…”).
- Previews 2–3 clear reasons you will develop (e.g., new industries; maintenance and oversight jobs; relocation and skills development; creative jobs are safe).
- Uses confident, precise language (no hedging or redundancy).

**You:** In globalized world, automation is promoted in every industries such as agriculture and even retell. The concern about losing job due to it has been discussed nowadays. However, I firmly believe that automation will eventually increase global employment opportunities undoubtedly due to the rise of new industries , industrial relocation and demand of creative job.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:55:24.438Z

**Assistant:** Nice attempt — good job stating your position and listing reasons. A few focused notes to help you tighten the thesis:

What’s working
- Clear position: you say automation will increase employment.
- You list three reasons, which is good for a preview.

What to fix in this sentence
- Remove unnecessary words: “However,” “I,” “firmly,” and “undoubtedly” are redundant or weaken clarity. A thesis should be direct and concise.
- Grammar and word choice: use parallel structure and correct phrases — e.g., “demand of creative job” → “demand for creative jobs”; “industrial relocation” → “relocation of manufacturing” or “industrial relocation and upskilling.”
- Make the preview parallel and specific: list three short, parallel phrases (e.g., “new industries, relocated manufacturing and upskilling, and greater demand for creative and oversight roles”).
- Place the thesis where it clearly answers the question in one sentence (no “This essay will…”).

Try this checklist as you rewrite
- One clear claim: automation will ultimately increase global employment.
- Two to three parallel reasons, each short and specific.
- Confident, concise language (no hedging or redundancy).

Would you like to try revising the thesis again now? If you want, I can show 1–2 model thesis sentences after your next attempt. Which do you prefer?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:55:40.108Z

**You:** In globalized world, automation is promoted in every industries such as agriculture and even retell. The concern about losing job due to it has been discussed nowadays. I believe that automation will ultimately increase global employment due to the rise of new industries, relocation of manufacturing and demand for creative jobs.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:58:19.167Z

**Assistant:** Good work — this is a solid attempt. You have a clear stance and you preview reasons, which is exactly what we want. Now let’s tighten wording, grammar, and parallel structure so the thesis is stronger and clearer.

Brief feedback on your attempt
- Strengths: Clear claim (automation will increase employment) and three previewed reasons — that gives a useful roadmap.
- Main fixes needed:
  - Remove unnecessary background sentences from the thesis paragraph — the thesis should be one clear sentence that answers the question.
  - Drop “I believe” (keep it confident and direct).
  - Make the three reasons parallel and specific (use similar grammatical forms).
  - Fix small grammar/word-choice problems: “In globalized world” → “In a globalized world,” “retell” → “retail,” “losing job” → “job loss.”

Quick suggestions you can use to revise (pick what you want)
- Keep one strong thesis sentence only. Example structure to follow:
  - Claim + because/through + three parallel reasons.
- Make the reasons parallel: e.g., “the rise of new industries, the relocation of manufacturing, and increased demand for creative and oversight roles.”
- Use precise nouns: “relocation of manufacturing” or “relocation of production,” “upskilling” or “investment in skills,” etc.

Would you like to try revising the thesis now? 
- If you want help, I can show 1–2 short model thesis sentences for you to adapt. 
- Or, try another version yourself and I’ll give focused feedback.

Once you’re happy with the thesis, which body paragraph would you like to work on next for topic-sentence and paragraph revision?
- The paragraph arguing automation causes job loss (paragraph 1), or
- The paragraph arguing automation creates jobs (paragraph 2)?

Which do you choose?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:58:39.768Z

**You:** Move on to next step: Revise topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:59:28.112Z

**Assistant:** Great — quick note: we need to finish Step 1 (thesis) before we move into Step 2 (topic sentence). That’s okay — we can do both quickly.

1) Thesis: please confirm the exact thesis sentence you want to work with now (paste it), or tell me if you want to use a revised option I can suggest. If you’d like a ready-to-use model you can accept or edit, here is one you can adapt:

- Automation will ultimately increase global employment because it creates new industries, relocates and expands production in developing countries, and raises demand for creative and oversight roles that complement machines.

Do you want to:
a) Use that sentence as your thesis (I’ll accept it and we’ll move on), or
b) Paste your own thesis now so we can revise it together, or
c) Try rewriting it yourself first and paste your attempt?

2) Paragraph choice for Step 2: which body paragraph do you want to revise?
- Paragraph A (arguing that automation causes job loss — your first body paragraph), or
- Paragraph B (arguing that automation creates jobs — your second body paragraph)?

Once you pick a paragraph, please paste its current topic sentence (or the whole paragraph if you prefer). I’ll give focused feedback on how well the topic sentence links to the thesis and then prompt you to try a revision. Would you like to proceed?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:59:41.988Z

**You:** Paragraph A please

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:05:21.939Z

**Assistant:** Good choice — Paragraph A is a useful place to focus because tightening its topic sentence will improve the essay’s logical flow.

Quick step we must finish first: confirm the thesis we’ll use. I suggested this earlier as a clear, academic thesis that previews three reasons. Please choose one:

a) Use this refined thesis as-is:
Automation will ultimately increase global employment by creating new industries, relocating and expanding manufacturing in developing countries, and increasing demand for creative and oversight roles that complement machines.

b) Use the thesis already in your revised draft (I believe…): 
I believe that automation will ultimately increase global employment due to the rise of new industries, relocation of manufacturing and demand for creative jobs.

c) Paste a different thesis now (your revision) and I’ll give quick feedback.

Which do you choose (a, b, or c)? Once you confirm the thesis, we’ll move to Step 2 (Paragraph A).

Step 2 preview (Paragraph A: job-loss paragraph)
- Paste the paragraph’s current topic sentence here (or confirm it is: “Obviously, many low-skilled and cheap labors started to be replaced by machines now.”).
- Before I give examples, would you like to try revising that topic sentence yourself to better link to the confirmed thesis? 
  - Try to: (1) state the paragraph’s main idea clearly, (2) show it’s a short-term/real concern (so it connects to your later rebuttal), and (3) use correct grammar and precise wording (e.g., “low-skilled workers,” “are being displaced,” “automation”).
- If you prefer, I can show 1–2 model topic sentences after you try.

Would you like to revise the topic sentence now, or see a model first?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:05:36.043Z

**You:** b

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:07:02.354Z

**Assistant:** Great — we’ll use option (b) as your thesis for now:
I believe that automation will ultimately increase global employment due to the rise of new industries, relocation of manufacturing and demand for creative jobs.

Quick note: normally I’d suggest removing "I believe" to make the thesis stronger, but you chose to keep this version, so we’ll work with it.

Step 2 — Paragraph A (topic sentence)

Current topic sentence you gave:  
“Obviously, many low-skilled and cheap labors started to be replaced by machines now.”

Focused feedback on that sentence and how it should link to your thesis
- Grammar and word choice:
  - Use “low-skilled workers” (not “labors”).
  - Prefer present progressive or present perfect for ongoing change: “are being displaced” or “have been displaced.”
  - Avoid vague/time words like “now”; instead use “currently” or “in the short term” if you mean this is temporary.
- Purpose and logical link to thesis:
  - This paragraph is your counterargument: show that automation does cause job losses for some groups — but frame it as a short-term/sector-specific effect so it connects logically to your thesis that employment increases overall.
  - A good topic sentence should (1) state the main idea of the paragraph clearly and (2) signal that this is a limited/temporary problem you will later rebut.

Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence now? (Short attempt — one sentence.)  
If you want a model to adapt, here are two example topic sentences you can use or change (pick one to adapt or try your own):

Model A (explicit short-term frame):  
Many low-skilled workers are currently being displaced by automation, especially in routine manufacturing and processing roles.

Model B (contrast / sets up rebuttal):  
Although automation is displacing many low-skilled workers in the short term, this loss affects specific routine jobs rather than the labour market as a whole.

Which would you like to do?  
- Try your own revised topic sentence now, or  
- Adapt Model A or B and paste your adapted sentence.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:07:18.011Z

**You:** Move on to next paragraph

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:11:16.369Z

**Assistant:** Great — we’ll use the thesis you chose for now:
I believe that automation will ultimately increase global employment due to the rise of new industries, relocation of manufacturing and demand for creative jobs.

Now let’s revise Paragraph A’s topic sentence so it links clearly to that thesis.

Quick reminders for your sentence:
- Use “low-skilled workers” (not “labors”).
- Show this is a short-term or sector-specific effect (so it connects to your later rebuttal).
- Use correct verb tense: “are being displaced” or “have been displaced.”
- Keep it concise and direct.

You can:
1) Try your own revised topic sentence now (paste one sentence), or
2) Adapt one of these models and paste your version:
   - Model A: Many low-skilled workers are currently being displaced by automation, especially in routine manufacturing and processing roles.
   - Model B: Although automation is displacing many low-skilled workers in the short term, this loss affects specific routine jobs rather than the labour market as a whole.

Which do you want to try? Paste your sentence and I’ll give focused feedback.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:11:27.034Z

**You:** i mean the third paragraph

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:13:14.831Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — that’s clear. Quick check before we move to the third paragraph:

Are you happy to keep this thesis sentence for the essay?
I believe that automation will ultimately increase global employment due to the rise of new industries, relocation of manufacturing and demand for creative jobs.

Please reply yes/no. If no, tell me which part you want to change.

Now, about the third paragraph (the one that argues automation creates jobs):

Please paste either
- the current topic sentence for that paragraph, or
- the whole paragraph (your choice).

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now to make it link clearly to the thesis (one short sentence)? If so, write one attempt and paste it here. I’ll give focused feedback and then we’ll revise the rest of the paragraph together.

If you’d prefer a model to adapt instead, say “show models” and I’ll give 1–2 short example topic sentences you can edit.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:13:25.673Z

**You:** keep this thesis sentence. And the paragraph is:                                                                                                However, automation is actually increasing job opportunities. First and foremost, automation creates new industries. The maintenance of automatic machines required a huge amount of labor. They can act like security observers with low education background. Besides, the job market is not explored. There are many developing countries which have a lot of cheap labors. As developed countries lack of cheap labors, the industry of making automatic machines can be relocated to developed countries. To recruit required labors, developing countries can receive invention from the rich countries and their educational and professional industries can rise significantly. Last but not least, Ai will not replace all human jobs. Moravec's paradox reflects that AI is good at reasoning but not recognition and creation. Thus, job needs creativity is safe. There are AI bias too. As a result, a specific professional industry is required to check and correct them. Automation is building more and more chance in global employment prospects.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:15:11.893Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming the thesis. We’ll keep:
I believe that automation will ultimately increase global employment due to the rise of new industries, relocation of manufacturing and demand for creative jobs.

Step 2 — Topic sentence for this paragraph
You pasted the paragraph and the current topic sentence is:
"However, automation is actually increasing job opportunities."

Feedback on that topic sentence and link to the thesis
- Positives: It signals the paragraph is the rebuttal and states the main claim.
- Improvements needed to link to the thesis and your targets (structure + grammar/word choice):
  - Be more specific: connect the idea to the thesis preview (new industries, relocation, creative/oversight roles).
  - Clarify tense and register: avoid “actually” (informal) and use tighter academic phrasing.
  - Make the sentence show why this paragraph supports the thesis (mention one or more mechanisms).

Try revising the topic sentence now (one short sentence). Would you like to try on your own, or adapt one of these models?

Two model topic sentences you can adapt
- Model 1 (general + link to mechanisms): Automation is already creating new job opportunities by spawning new industries, shifting production to different regions, and increasing demand for creative and oversight roles.
- Model 2 (focus on one main idea): One important effect of automation is the creation of new industries and service jobs — for example, machine maintenance, monitoring, and AI-auditing roles — which expand employment overall.

Pick one to adapt or write your own. Paste your revised topic sentence and I’ll give quick feedback.

Step 3 — Preparing to revise the rest of the paragraph
Before we edit, here are the main issues in the paragraph to fix once the topic sentence is set:
- Grammar and word choice: e.g., “required a huge amount of labor” → requires a large workforce; “They can act like security observers with low education background” → unclear and awkward; “cheap labors” → “low-wage workers” or “low-cost labour”; “relocated to developed countries” is probably the wrong direction — you mean relocated to developing countries; “receive invention” → “receive investment” or “technology transfer”; “Ai” → “AI”; “There are AI bias too” → “AI systems can be biased”; “a specific professional industry is required” → “specialised professions are needed to audit and correct them.”
- Logical order and unity: Some sentences jump between points (maintenance → security observers → job market in developing countries → AI limits). Group related ideas and use short transitions.
- Support and clarity: Some claims need clearer explanation or examples and smoother linking to the thesis.

Suggested small revision tasks (pick 1–2 to work on next)
- Revise the topic sentence (we’re already doing this).
- Then, rewrite 2 supporting sentences: (a) the sentence about maintenance jobs, and (b) the sentence about relocation/impact on developing countries. Focus on grammar and clearer links to the topic sentence.
Would you like to:
A) Try revising the topic sentence now (paste it), and then revise the two supporting sentences yourself, or
B) Revise only the topic sentence first and ask me for model rewrites for the two supporting sentences afterward?

Quick encouragement: try one short revised topic sentence now — I’ll respond quickly with focused feedback, then we’ll revise the supporting sentences together. Which option do you choose?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:15:33.515Z

**You:** Move to the final paragraph: In conclusion, admittedly, there are people who lose their job in short-term because of automation. Nevertheless, automation starts to provide a lot of new jobs for people. Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:17:20.253Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — quick check before we continue: are you happy to keep this thesis for the essay?
I believe that automation will ultimately increase global employment due to the rise of new industries, relocation of manufacturing and demand for creative jobs.
Please reply yes or no.

A quick note about scope: the revision workflow asks us to revise the thesis, then one body paragraph (topic sentence + that paragraph’s supporting sentences). The conclusion (final paragraph) is outside that main scope. I can give brief, focused feedback on your conclusion now, but for the full three-step process I recommend we pick one body paragraph to revise (I suggest the paragraph that argues automation creates jobs because it directly supports your thesis).

Which would you like to do?
A) Proceed with the three-step process and revise the body paragraph that argues automation creates jobs (recommended), or  
B) You want brief feedback on the conclusion now (I’ll give quick, targeted suggestions), or  
C) You want to switch and revise the other body paragraph (the job-loss paragraph) instead.

If you choose A or C, paste the topic sentence of that paragraph (or confirm the one we already discussed) and try one short revision of it — I’ll give focused feedback and we’ll move to revising the rest of that paragraph.  
If you choose B, I’ll give 2–3 clear, short suggestions to improve the conclusion and invite you to try rewriting it. Which do you choose?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:17:40.270Z

**You:** Yes and I choose A

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:24:22.347Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming the thesis and choosing to revise the paragraph that argues automation creates jobs. We’ll follow the plan: first improve the topic sentence so it links clearly to your thesis, then revise a couple of supporting sentences for clarity, unity, and grammar.

Quick confirmation of the thesis we’re keeping:
I believe that automation will ultimately increase global employment due to the rise of new industries, relocation of manufacturing and demand for creative jobs.
(If you want to drop “I believe” later that’s fine, but we’ll keep it for now.)

Step 2 — Topic sentence
Current topic sentence in that paragraph: “However, automation is actually increasing job opportunities.”

Your turn first: please try revising the topic sentence now (one short sentence). Aim to:
- Be a bit more specific (link to the mechanisms in your thesis: new industries, relocation, creative/oversight roles).
- Remove informal words like “actually.”
- Use clear academic phrasing.

If you want a model to adapt instead of writing one from scratch, pick one below and paste your adapted version:
Model A: Automation is already creating new job opportunities by spawning industries, shifting production to new regions, and increasing demand for creative and oversight roles.
Model B: One important effect of automation is the creation of new industries and service jobs—such as machine maintenance and AI auditing—which expand employment overall.

Which do you want to do: try your own revision, or adapt Model A or B? Paste your one-sentence revision and I’ll give quick, focused feedback.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:24:34.741Z

**You:** Move on to next part: Revise one body paragraph.

**Assistant:** Nice work choosing the paragraph that supports your thesis — that’s the paragraph that will most clearly show the logic of your argument. I revised only what you asked: the topic sentence and the rest of that one body paragraph (Step 2 and Step 3). Below is the full essay with that paragraph improved. After the text, I’ll give a very short explanation of the main changes and one or two next steps you can do.

Full revised essay (only the second body paragraph changed)

Automation blesses global employment prospect

  In globalized world, automation is promoted in every industries such as agriculture and even retell. The concern about losing job due to it has been discussed nowadays. I believe that automation will ultimately increase global employment due to the rise of new industries, relocation of manufacturing and demand for creative jobs.
  Obviously, many low-skilled workers are currently being displaced by automation, especially in routine manufacturing and processing roles. For example, many factories use machine to process meat like KFC. Through using machines, cheap labors' skill is not needed. Furthermore, the industry in marking common automatic machines is also automatic and thus costs fewer. This leads to the trend of replacing labor with automation dramatically. Finally, the rise of AI causes a terrible sense imaged by many people: Will all staffs replaced by smart robots? For example, AI can replace low-level programmers as AI reasoning is more efficient than human. Human may loss all job opportunities as AI is smarter than us.
  However, automation is already creating new job opportunities by spawning new industries, shifting production to different regions, and increasing demand for creative and oversight roles. First and foremost, automation creates new industries that require workers to build, operate, and service machines. For example, the maintenance and repair of automated machinery requires technicians, engineers, and support staff, creating many new positions. Some of these roles—such as machine operators, maintenance technicians, and monitoring staff—can be filled by workers with vocational training rather than a university degree. Additionally, production and assembly for automation equipment often shift toward developing countries; as manufacturing relocates, local economies receive new investment and technology transfer, which stimulates growth in education, vocational training, and related service industries. Finally, AI will not replace all human jobs: Moravec’s paradox suggests that, although AI can perform high-level reasoning tasks, it struggles with perception, fine-motor skills, and many creative or social tasks. AI systems can also reflect biases or make errors, so specialised professionals are needed to audit, correct, and regulate these systems. In these ways, automation is expanding diverse employment opportunities worldwide.
  In conclusion, admittedly, there are people who lose their job in short-term because of automation. Nevertheless, automation starts to provide a lot of new jobs for people. Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.

What I changed (brief, focused)
- Topic sentence: made it specific and directly linked to the three mechanisms you previewed in your thesis (new industries; relocation; creative/oversight roles).
- Supporting sentences: clarified the maintenance/technician point, corrected grammar (e.g., “requires” instead of “required”), and made the roles and training level clearer.
- Relocation sentence: corrected the direction (manufacturing can relocate to developing countries) and replaced “receive invention” with “receive investment and technology transfer.”
- AI sentences: clarified the point about Moravec’s paradox and why some jobs remain safe; added the oversight/auditing point to show new job demand.
- Improved word choice and sentence structure across the paragraph for clearer logical flow and unity.

Quick suggestions for next steps (pick 1)
- Tighten the thesis by removing “I believe” for a more academic tone (optional).
- Revise the first body paragraph (the counterargument paragraph) so its topic sentence signals that the job loss is a short-term or sector-specific effect — this will improve flow into your rebuttal.
- Work sentence-by-sentence through the introduction and conclusion to fix grammar and word choice.

Would you like to:
- a) Try revising the counterargument paragraph’s topic sentence next (I’ll guide you), or
- b) Ask me to make the small optional edit to the thesis (remove “I believe”), or
- c) Move to sentence-level grammar edits for this revised paragraph?

Which do you prefer?
