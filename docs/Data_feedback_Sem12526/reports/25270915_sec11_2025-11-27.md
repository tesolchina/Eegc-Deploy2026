**Revised Essay:**

With the developments of automatic technology, advanced methods like AI tools are applied to industries and many other aspects. Although technological shifts are necessary, they must be managed carefully to protect workers from unemployment and to ensure access to retraining and social support. That transformation has enhanced efficiency a lot but also caused the unemployment rate to rise. The application of new technology meets the needs of a rapidly changing society. It is significant for companies to stimulate efficiency; therefore, the shift to automation has become a demand in the current era. With higher efficiency, people can potentially save more time and enjoy a more convenient lifestyle. One example is the success of electronic payments. With apps on mobile devices, people no longer need to use cash, and the safety of financial transactions has also improved.

On the other hand, rapid automation threatens widespread job losses that require retraining and social policies. Some jobs may be replaced by technology, so there is a high risk of unemployment. Despite the fact that new opportunities will emerge, such as AI engineers, it will take time for people and society to adapt to these changes. For example, many routine jobs can be automated, causing low-skilled workers to lose employment; without retraining programs and social support, these workers may face long-term hardship. New types of employees will need time for education and development, and the employment structure will be reshaped as well.

In conclusion, the transformation of technological industries is possible in the long term. What we need to pay attention to is the potential consequences of this progress and how we can respond to the demands of a changing era instead of being unprepared.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The original communicates a clear position (accept technological change but call for caution) and gives one example (electronic payments), but ideas are only somewhat developed and lack depth and clear cause/effect explanation.
- Organization: 17/25 - The essay has an intended structure (benefits then drawbacks) but paragraph unity, transitions, and logical sequencing are weak.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Some useful topic terms appear (automation, efficiency), but word choice is often imprecise and inconsistent (e.g., “automatic technology,” “electric payments,” “applicants in mobile Facilities”).
- Grammar: 13/25 - Frequent errors (articles, verb forms, punctuation, capitalization) impair clarity (e.g., “needs to be cautiously,” “being unemployment,” run‑ons and fragments).
- **Original Essay Total: 63/100**

Evidence (original):
- Thesis: “the technological shift is necessary but it also needs to be cautiously” (grammatical and clarity problems).
- Topic sentence (original P2): “On the other side, the direct shift may cause the society, couldn’t afford the rapidly transformation.” (ungrammatical and vague)

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised essay makes the central stance clearer and introduces policy/education as responses to unemployment; Paragraph 2 adds an explanatory example linking automation to worker hardship.
- Organization: 20/25 - Structure is clearer after inserting a stronger thesis and a focused topic sentence for Paragraph 2; paragraph-level unity improved, but some sentences elsewhere still lack clear sequencing.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Better lexical choices appear in revised sentences (e.g., “rapid automation,” “retraining and social policies”), though other parts of the essay remain awkwardly phrased and inconsistent in register.
- Grammar: 17/25 - Noticeable improvement: the thesis and topic sentence are grammatical and clear; Paragraph 2 support sentence is well formed. However, many remaining errors persist in other paragraphs (capitalization, punctuation, articles, awkward phrasing).
- **Revised Essay Total: 76/100**

Evidence (revised):
- Revised thesis (assistant’s polished suggestion used in essay): “Although technological shifts are necessary, they must be managed carefully to protect workers from unemployment and to ensure access to retraining and social support.”
- Revised topic sentence (P2): “On the other hand, rapid automation threatens widespread job losses that require retraining and social policies.”
- New supporting sentence (P2): “For example, many routine jobs can be automated, causing low-skilled workers to lose employment; without retraining programs and social support, these workers may face long-term hardship.”

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +13 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clearer, stronger thesis that links benefits of technology to social safeguards.
  - A grammatically correct, focused topic sentence for Paragraph 2 that directly connects to the thesis.
  - Added a focused supporting sentence clarifying how automation causes job loss and why retraining/support are needed.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Global mechanical and sentence-level issues remain throughout the essay (capitalization, punctuation, article use, verb forms). A full pass for grammar/ proofreading is needed.
  - Development and evidence: only one clear example (electronic payments) is discussed—more varied and detailed examples, statistics, or citations would strengthen arguments.
  - Organization across the whole essay still needs work: improve transitions, remove repeated/contradictory phrasing (there are duplicated ideas and awkward insertions).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 21**
- **Conversation Quality:** The interaction followed a structured revision workflow (diagnosis → thesis → topic sentence → paragraph support). Exchanges were frequent and iterative; the assistant guided with prompts and examples, and the student engaged by choosing targets, submitting revised text, and accepting/adapting suggestions.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - Evidence: ~21 exchanges across multiple revision steps; the assistant and student worked through a multi-step plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph support) with detailed back-and-forth. Example: assistant’s stepwise plan and multiple follow-ups (timestamps and step labels in chat).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - Evidence: The student actively rewrote the thesis and selected/adapted topic-sentence models rather than blindly accepting everything. They asked for examples and chose which suggestion to use. However, most AI suggestions were accepted without extensive critique or alternative proposals from the student; some independence shown but not thorough evidence-based rejection of specific AI options.
- **Refining Process**: 4/5 - Evidence: Clear iterative process — student provided an original thesis, proposed a revision, received targeted feedback, accepted and polished a refined thesis, then revised paragraph topic sentence and added a supporting sentence. There were multiple meaningful steps, though the student did not complete a full paragraph-level rewrite independently (the assistant supplied the model supporting sentence).

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 13/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Adopted a clear revision workflow and followed it diligently (student selected focus areas and paragraph).
- Showed willingness to revise and incorporate feedback (produced a new thesis and accepted a stronger topic sentence).
- Engaged in iterative collaboration: asked for examples and chose specific revisions (thesis and P2 topic sentence).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Grammar and mechanics: systematic proofreading required (capitalization, punctuation, articles, verb forms).
- Expanded development: add more specific, varied evidence and deepen analysis (why and how automation causes specific harms, economic data, examples of successful retraining).
- Independent revision: practice rewriting whole paragraphs in your own words to demonstrate independent editing after AI guidance.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - Student provided the full original essay and clear revision targets (“Grammar/word choice + Paragraph 2”).
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - Student chose specific goals and followed the assistant’s stepwise plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph support).
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good - Student adapted suggestions (wrote a revised thesis) and selected an AI-provided topic sentence rather than accepting an unmodified output, but could push further by challenging or testing alternatives.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement to Good - Student made some independent edits (thesis) but relied partly on the assistant for supporting sentence generation; more independent paragraph rewriting would strengthen this skill.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Do a focused grammar/proofreading pass across the entire essay (use a checklist: capitalization, articles, verb agreement, punctuation, sentence boundaries). Consider using sentence-level editing tools or peer review.
2. Expand evidence in body paragraphs: add at least one additional concrete example or brief data point for each claim, and explain how each example supports the thesis.
3. Practice independent paragraph rewrites after receiving AI suggestions: try producing your own version first, then compare with AI models to build editing confidence and critical evaluation skills.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student followed the assistant’s structured revision workflow and made measurable changes to thesis and Paragraph 2. The interaction record shows strong engagement and clear targeted edits.
- Remaining work: the essay still requires substantial global editing for grammar and cohesion and additional development (more examples and clearer transitions). The student would benefit from in-class work on sentence-level mechanics and paragraph development strategies.
- Recommendation: require one more revision round focusing on full-essay proofreading and adding one extra piece of evidence for each body paragraph; assess the student’s independent paragraph rewriting ability next time.

If you would like, I can now:
- Provide a full copyedit of the entire revised essay (mechanics + clarity),
- Suggest two more supporting examples and show how to integrate them,
- Or give a checklist the student can use for final proofreading. Which would you prefer?

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-27T13:46:24.225Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a good place to start. First, let’s agree goals and diagnose the draft so we can pick clear targets for revision.

1) Negotiating targets
- What do you most want to improve in this session? (Choose one or two)
  - Clarity of the thesis / stronger argument
  - Organization and paragraph unity (topic sentences)
  - Development and evidence (examples, explanation)
  - Grammar, word choice and sentence clarity
  - Style and academic tone

Tell me which one or two you want to focus on today.

2) Quick diagnostic feedback (using rubric categories)
I read your draft. Here’s a short diagnosis with strengths and areas to work on.

- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: You have a clear overall position: you accept technological change but want caution about social effects.
  - Needs work: The thesis sentence is unclear, unfocused and hedged. It doesn’t clearly preview the main points you will discuss.

- Organization
  - Strengths: Your essay attempts a logical balance (benefits first, drawbacks next).
  - Needs work: Paragraphing and sentence sequencing need to be clearer. Topic sentences should directly link to the thesis and preview the paragraph’s idea.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: You use an example (electronic payments) — good start.
  - Needs work: Evidence is limited and not explained in depth. You should explain how examples support your point and add at least one more concrete example or explanation.

- Language Use (grammar, vocabulary, clarity)
  - Strengths: Meaning is often recoverable — your ideas are understandable.
  - Needs work: Many grammar, punctuation, and word-choice errors interrupt flow. Academic tone needs to be more formal. Sentences are often fragmented or run-on and need editing for clarity.

3) Suggested priorities (pick up to two)
- Option A: Improve the thesis and then revise one body paragraph’s topic sentence and content (good if you want stronger argument & structure).
- Option B: Focus on grammar and sentence clarity across one paragraph (good if you want clearer language).
- Option C: Improve evidence and development in one paragraph (good if you want stronger support for your ideas).

Which option do you choose? Also, please tell me which body paragraph you want to work on:
- Paragraph 1: the paragraph about efficiency and examples (electronic payments).
- Paragraph 2: the paragraph about job losses and social adjustment.

When you confirm your targets and the paragraph, we’ll begin Step 1: revising the thesis. I’ll ask you to share your current thesis sentence exactly as it is, then give feedback and invite you to try a revision. Ready?

*Time:* 2025-11-27T13:46:37.380Z

**You:** "the technological shift is necessary but it also needs to be cautiously." is my thesis statement, can you help me revise it?

*Time:* 2025-11-27T13:47:51.863Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for sharing your thesis. Before we start revising it, let’s confirm two quick things so we follow the agreed workflow.

1) Targets — which one or two do you want to focus on today?
- Clarity of the thesis / stronger argument
- Organization and paragraph unity (topic sentences)
- Development and evidence (examples, explanation)
- Grammar, word choice and sentence clarity
- Style and academic tone

Which of these one or two would you like us to work on? (If you’re not sure, I recommend focusing on “Clarity of the thesis / stronger argument” and “Grammar, word choice and sentence clarity.”)

2) Which body paragraph do you want to revise later?
- Paragraph 1 (efficiency and the electronic payments example)
- Paragraph 2 (job losses and social adjustment)

Once you confirm those, we’ll move to Step 1.

Brief feedback on your current thesis — “the technological shift is necessary but it also needs to be cautiously.”
- What’s good: It states a clear position: you accept the shift but call for caution.
- What to fix:
  - Grammar and wording: “needs to be cautiously” is incorrect. Use “approached cautiously” or “managed carefully.”
  - Strength and clarity: it’s vague and doesn’t preview the specific reasons you will discuss.
  - Tone: remove hedging and make it confident and precise.

Hints to help you rewrite (try one first before I give a model):
- Use a structure that shows your stance and previews two main points. For example: While I agree that technological change is necessary, it must be managed carefully to X and Y.
- Replace “needs to be cautiously” with “must be managed cautiously,” “should be implemented with safeguards,” or “requires careful planning to protect workers.”
- Make it one clear sentence that answers the question and previews your main supporting points (efficiency/benefits and unemployment/social response).

Would you like to try revising the thesis now? If you want, write your new version and I’ll give focused feedback and help you refine it. If you prefer, say “show me an example” and I’ll provide one model thesis for you to adapt.

*Time:* 2025-11-27T13:48:11.094Z

**You:** 1.Grammar, word choice and sentence clarity
2.Paragraph 2

*Time:* 2025-11-27T13:50:28.095Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for picking targets. I’ve noted that you want to focus on:
- Grammar, word choice and sentence clarity
- Revising Paragraph 2 (the paragraph about job losses and social adjustment)

Confirming that — shall we proceed? If yes, please paste the exact thesis sentence you want to revise (copy it exactly as it appears in your essay). That will be Step 1.

Quick, focused feedback on the thesis you showed earlier (“the technological shift is necessary but it also must be managed cautiously.”):
- Grammar: change “needs to be cautiously” → “must be managed cautiously” (or “must be managed carefully” / “requires careful management”).
- Clarity & strength: it states a position but doesn’t preview the reasons you will give (e.g., benefits like efficiency and risks like unemployment and the need for training).
- Tone: make it more confident and concise; remove extra words.

Hint for rewriting: try a one-sentence thesis that:
- States your stance clearly,
- Previews two specific reasons you will discuss (for example, economic/efficiency benefits and social/ employment costs and the need for policy/education).

Would you like to try revising the thesis now? Write your new sentence and I’ll give focused feedback. If you’d prefer an example to adapt, say “Show me an example.”

*Time:* 2025-11-27T13:50:35.906Z

**You:** "On the other side, the direct shift may cause the society, couldn’t afford the rapidly transformation."is my topic sentences of paragraph 2, please revise it

*Time:* 2025-11-27T14:09:36.625Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is helpful. Before I revise that topic sentence, we need to follow the agreed workflow so we focus our work and make the revision most effective.

1) Quick check — pick your targets (choose one or two)
- Clarity of the thesis / stronger argument
- Organization and paragraph unity (topic sentences)
- Development and evidence (examples, explanation)
- Grammar, word choice and sentence clarity
- Style and academic tone

Which one or two do you want us to focus on today? (If you’re not sure, I recommend: Grammar/word choice + Paragraph 2 — since you asked about that paragraph.)

2) Confirm the paragraph to work on
You said the topic sentence for Paragraph 2 is:
"On the other side, the direct shift may cause the society, couldn’t afford the rapidly transformation."

Is Paragraph 2 the one about job losses and social adjustment? Confirm yes/no.

3) Step 1 (Thesis) — before we change a topic sentence, we revise the thesis so the paragraph links clearly.
Please paste the exact thesis sentence from your essay (copy it exactly). I’ll give quick feedback and then ask you to try a revision. If you’d rather skip and go straight to the topic sentence, tell me and I’ll note that — but the recommended order is thesis first.

Quick hint about the thesis you shared before (“the technological shift is necessary but it also must be managed cautiously.”):
- Fix grammar (“must be managed cautiously” is better than “needs to be cautiously”).
- Make it stronger by previewing the two main points you’ll discuss (e.g., benefits like efficiency AND social risks like unemployment/need for policy).
Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Write one sentence and I’ll give focused feedback.

When you’re ready, paste the thesis and confirm your selected targets and paragraph choice. Then we’ll move through Step 1.

*Time:* 2025-11-27T14:09:56.675Z

**You:** 1.Grammar/word choice + Paragraph 2
2.yes
3.the technological shift is necessary but it also needs to be cautiously
my whole passage:

*Time:* 2025-11-27T14:11:59.685Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. I’ve noted your confirmed targets:
- Focus: Grammar, word choice and sentence clarity
- Paragraph to revise later: Paragraph 2 (job losses and social adjustment)

You pasted your current thesis exactly:  
"the technological shift is necessary but it also needs to be cautiously"

Quick, specific feedback on that thesis
- Grammar: “needs to be cautiously” is incorrect. Use an adjective or a passive verb: e.g., “must be managed cautiously,” “should be approached with caution,” or “requires careful management.”
- Clarity & strength: It states a position but is vague. It does not preview the reasons you will give.
- Tone: Start with a capital letter and remove hedging; make the sentence confident and precise.

A simple thesis structure to aim for (use this as a template, then try your own sentence):
- Although I agree that technological shifts are necessary, they must be managed carefully to [benefit/example 1] and to [address risk/example 2].
Example ideas to fill the brackets:
- benefit/example 1: increase efficiency, improve services (e.g., electronic payments)
- risk/example 2: protect workers from unemployment, provide retraining and social policy

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now? Please write one clear sentence that:
1) States your stance (accepts the shift but calls for caution), and
2) Previews two specific points you will discuss (for example: efficiency/benefits AND unemployment/need for retraining or policy).

Write your new thesis sentence when you’re ready. If you prefer, say “Show me an example” and I’ll give one model sentence for you to adapt.

*Time:* 2025-11-27T14:12:16.817Z

**You:** From my opinion, the technological shift is necessary but it also must be managed cautiously to protect workers from unemployment, provide retraining and social policy.

*Time:* 2025-11-27T14:15:53.482Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that thesis already shows a clearer position. Let’s polish it so it’s grammatically correct, confident, and previews the two main points you’ll discuss (benefits and social risks). First, quick feedback, then I’ll offer one suggested revision and show the full essay with that thesis inserted. Tell me if you want to try another version yourself or accept this one.

Feedback on your sentence:
"From my opinion, the technological shift is necessary but it also must be managed cautiously to protect workers from unemployment, provide retraining and social policy."

- Good: Clear stance (accepts the shift) and mentions two main concerns (protect workers / retraining & policy).
- Fixes needed:
  - “From my opinion” → incorrect; use “In my opinion” or remove the phrase and state the position directly.
  - Parallelism: the list should be parallel. Change “protect workers from unemployment, provide retraining and social policy” to something like “protect workers from unemployment and provide retraining and social support” or “protect workers from unemployment by providing retraining and social policies.”
  - Tone: drop weak phrasing like “From my opinion.” Use a confident structure: “Although… , …” or “While I agree… , …”

Suggested revision (one clear, formal version you can use or adapt):
"Although technological shifts are necessary, they must be managed carefully to protect workers from unemployment and to ensure access to retraining and social support."

I’ve placed that thesis into your current essay below (I changed only the thesis sentence so we stay within our agreed scope). Read it and tell me:
- Do you want to keep this version, or
- Would you like to try rewriting the thesis yourself first?

Full essay with the suggested thesis inserted (only thesis sentence changed):

with the developments of Automatic technology, advanced methods like Al tools are applied to industries and many other aspects. Although technological shifts are necessary, they must be managed carefully to protect workers from unemployment and to ensure access to retraining and social support. That transformation enhanced efficiency a lot but also made the unemployment rate rises From my opinion, the technological shift is necessary but it also must be managed cautiously.(.The application of new technology meets the need of more and more rapidly pace of society .it is significant for companies to stimulate efficiency, Therefore, the shift to automation has become the demand under era background. With the higher efficiency, people could possibly save more time and realize more convenient life style. The example is the success of electric payments, With applicants in mobile Facilities, people could no longer need to use cash, and the safety of finance has also improved.
On the other side, the direct shift may cause the society, couldn’t afford the rapidly transformation. Some jobs may be replaced by the technology, so there might be a high risk of being unemployment. Despite the fact that there will be new opportunities of work like AI Engineers, it needs time for people ,for society to deal with the Coming problems. New types of employees demand time to be educated and developed, new structure of employment will be reshaped as well
In a word, the transformation of technological industries is possible in long term,. What me need to be paying attention to is what the progress may be led to and how we could respond to the different era demanding instead of without any preparation about it.

Next step
If you’re happy with the revised thesis, we’ll move to Step 2: pick Paragraph 2 (the job-loss paragraph) and work on its topic sentence. Paste the exact topic sentence you want to revise (copy it exactly), and I’ll give focused feedback and ask you to try a revision. If you want to try another thesis first, write it now and I’ll respond. Which do you prefer?

*Time:* 2025-11-27T14:16:26.825Z

**You:** step 2: On the other side, the direct shift may cause the society, couldn’t afford the rapidly transformation.

*Time:* 2025-11-27T14:18:22.150Z

**Assistant:** Nice — thanks for pasting the topic sentence. Quick reminder of our agreed targets: we’re focusing on grammar/word choice and sentence clarity, and working on Paragraph 2 (job losses and social adjustment). Now let’s look at this sentence and prepare you to revise it.

Your topic sentence (copied):  
"On the other side, the direct shift may cause the society, couldn’t afford the rapidly transformation."

Feedback — what to fix and why (short and specific)
- Connector: use “On the other hand” (not “On the other side”).
- Word choice: “direct shift” is vague — use “rapid automation” or “rapid technological change.”
- Grammar: “may cause the society, couldn’t afford the rapidly transformation” is ungrammatical. Use “society could not afford” or “society may not be able to cope with” + “rapid transformation” (not “rapidly transformation”).
- Focus & link to thesis: right now it doesn’t preview what you will explain (job losses, need for retraining/support). A strong topic sentence should connect clearly to the thesis by naming the risk (unemployment/social strain) and hinting at the solution (retraining, policy) if that’s what the paragraph will discuss.

A simple structure to aim for (try this pattern):  
On the other hand, [short statement of the risk] unless/without [brief mention of what is needed to prevent it].

Examples of useful language to include: rapid automation, job loss, unemployment, social hardship/strain, retraining, social support, policy.

Would you like to try rewriting that one sentence now? Try one clear version that:
- Uses “On the other hand,”
- Names the main risk (job loss/unemployment/social strain),
- Hints at what’s needed (retraining/support/policy).

Write your revision and I’ll give focused feedback. If you prefer, say “Show an example” and I’ll give one model sentence you can adapt.

*Time:* 2025-11-27T14:18:43.018Z

**You:** Show an example

*Time:* 2025-11-27T14:19:31.603Z

**Assistant:** Great — here are three model topic sentences you can adapt. Each one links clearly to your thesis (need to manage change to protect workers) and fixes the grammar and word choice problems.

1) Concise/academic:
"On the other hand, rapid automation threatens widespread job losses that require retraining and social policies."

2) More explicit link to thesis and paragraph content:
"On the other hand, without careful management, rapid technological change can cause significant unemployment and social strain, so governments must provide retraining and social support."

3) Focus on society’s capacity to cope:
"On the other hand, society may not be able to cope with the speed of automation, since many workers could lose jobs before adequate retraining and protections are in place."

Would you like to:
- Pick one of these and adapt it, or
- Try writing your own revised topic sentence now?

Paste the exact sentence you choose (copy it exactly) and I’ll give quick feedback. After that, we’ll move to Step 3 and revise the supporting sentences in that paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-27T14:19:44.968Z

**You:** On the other hand, rapid automation threatens widespread job losses that require retraining and social policies.

*Time:* 2025-11-27T14:20:05.903Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that topic sentence is clear, grammatically correct, and it links well to the thesis. Quick confirmation of our agreed targets: you’re focusing on grammar, word choice and sentence clarity, and we’re revising Paragraph 2 (job losses and social adjustment).

Step 2 check — feedback on your topic sentence
Your sentence:  
"On the other hand, rapid automation threatens widespread job losses that require retraining and social policies."

- What’s good: It uses “On the other hand,” names the risk (job losses) and signals what’s needed (retraining, policy). It links directly to the thesis about managing change to protect workers.
- Small optional tweak (only if you want it): consider making the object of “require” a little more specific and parallel: e.g., “...that require retraining programs and social protection policies.” Either version is fine; your sentence is already strong.

Now I’ve inserted your chosen topic sentence and the revised thesis into your essay. Because you made a specific edit, here is the full revised essay (I only changed the thesis sentence and Paragraph 2 topic sentence as we agreed):

with the developments of Automatic technology, advanced methods like Al tools are applied to industries and many other aspects. Although technological shifts are necessary, they must be managed carefully to protect workers from unemployment and to ensure access to retraining and social support. That transformation enhanced efficiency a lot but also made the unemployment rate rises From my opinion, the technological shift is necessary but it also must be managed cautiously.(.The application of new technology meets the need of more and more rapidly pace of society .it is significant for companies to stimulate efficiency, Therefore, the shift to automation has become the demand under era background. With the higher efficiency, people could possibly save more time and realize more convenient life style. The example is the success of electric payments, With applicants in mobile Facilities, people could no longer need to use cash, and the safety of finance has also improved.
On the other hand, rapid automation threatens widespread job losses that require retraining and social policies. Some jobs may be replaced by the technology, so there might be a high risk of being unemployment. Despite the fact that there will be new opportunities of work like AI Engineers, it needs time for people ,for society to deal with the Coming problems. New types of employees demand time to be educated and developed, new structure of employment will be reshaped as well
In a word, the transformation of technological industries is possible in long term,. What me need to be paying attention to is what the progress may be led to and how we could respond to the different era demanding instead of without any preparation about it.

Step 3 — revise the rest of Paragraph 2 (your turn first)
Now let’s improve the supporting sentences in Paragraph 2 for clarity and unity (remember our targets: grammar, word choice, sentence clarity).

Quick guiding questions to use as you revise each sentence:
- Does this sentence clearly support the topic sentence (job loss + need for retraining/policies)?
- Does it explain how automation causes job loss, or how retraining/policy would help?
- Are verbs, articles, and word forms correct? (e.g., “being unemployment” → “unemployment”; “it needs time for people ,for society” → “it will take time for people and society”)
- Do sentences flow logically from one idea to the next? Use linking words (For example, However, Although, Therefore).

Try revising one or two sentences from Paragraph 2 now. Here are short model sentence starters you can adapt (I’m not giving a full paragraph rewrite — try to use these to make your own sentences):
- “For example, many routine tasks can be automated, which may cause low-skilled workers to lose their jobs.”
- “Although new roles such as AI engineers will appear, these jobs often require different skills and time for training.”
- “Therefore, governments and companies should provide retraining programs and temporary support so workers can transition.”

Which sentence would you like to revise first? Paste your revised sentence(s) when you’re ready and I’ll give focused feedback and then update the full essay (again, I’ll include the whole text when you make changes). If you prefer, I can give one example revision of a single supporting sentence for you to adapt — say “show one example” and I’ll provide a short model. Would you like to try revising now?

*Time:* 2025-11-27T14:20:37.211Z

**You:** show one example

*Time:* 2025-11-27T14:22:09.490Z

**Assistant:** Good — here’s one short example sentence you can adapt and use in Paragraph 2. It follows the topic sentence and stays focused on your targets (grammar, word choice, clarity):

Example sentence:
"For example, many routine jobs can be automated, causing low-skilled workers to lose employment; without retraining programs and social support, these workers may face long-term hardship."

Would you like to:
- Try adapting that sentence now and paste your version? (I’ll give quick feedback.)
- Or ask me to insert this sentence into your essay and show the full revised text?

When you revise, keep the guiding questions in mind:
- Does the sentence clearly support the topic sentence?
- Does it explain how automation causes job loss or how retraining/policy would help?
- Are verbs, articles, and word forms correct?
