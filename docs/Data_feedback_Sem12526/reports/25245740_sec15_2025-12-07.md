            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your work and questions! Here’s a focused analysis and concrete suggestions for strengthening your introduction and conclusion based on your draft and concerns:

---

### Introduction

**What works:**  
- Attempts to address the big topic of automation’s impact on employment.  
- Shows an intention to take a stance (automation “enhances” employment).  

**Areas to improve:**  
- **Engagement & clarity:** The opening sentence is unclear and awkward (“Automation means one provided us many benefits, including the world developed.”). This can confuse readers or fail to spark interest.  
- **Context:** You should briefly introduce automation as a concept relevant to your essay, so readers know the scope.  
- **Clear thesis:** Your thesis needs to be a single, clear sentence that precisely states your position and previews your main supporting ideas. Your current intro mixes several ideas without a focused statement.  

**Suggestions to strengthen your introduction:**  
- **Start with a clear hook/context sentence** that briefly defines automation and why it matters:  
  *Example:* “Automation—the use of machines and AI to perform tasks—has expanded rapidly across many industries.”  
- **Then narrow to the key issue or debate:**  
  *Example:* “This rapid change raises questions about its long-term effects on global employment.”  
- **End with a concise thesis statement:**  
  *Option 1 (direct):* “This essay argues that, despite some short-term job losses, automation will ultimately enhance employment opportunities worldwide by boosting productivity and creating new roles.”  
  *Option 2 (balanced):* “Although automation displaces certain routine jobs, it improves overall employment prospects by generating demand for specialized skills and creating new industries.”  

**Putting it together (sample revised intro):**  
“Automation—the use of machines and AI to perform tasks—has expanded rapidly across many industries. This rapid change raises questions about its long-term effects on global employment. This essay argues that, despite some short-term job losses, automation will ultimately enhance employment opportunities worldwide by boosting productivity and creating new roles.”

---

### Conclusion

**What works:**  
- Attempts to end on an advisory note about adapting to automation and using technology responsibly.  

**Areas to improve:**  
- **Restate your thesis clearly:** Remind readers of your position on automation and employment without introducing new ideas.  
- **Summarize main reasons:** Briefly highlight your key arguments supporting the thesis.  
- **End with a forward-looking or practical recommendation:** Leave readers with a memorable takeaway linked to your argument.  
- Avoid vague or unrelated points (e.g., crime or unclear social outcomes not developed in the essay).  

**Suggestions to strengthen your conclusion:**  
- **Restate thesis with a transition:**  
  *Example:* “Overall, while automation disrupts some jobs in the short term, its long-term impact on employment is positive.”  
- **Summarize key points:**  
  *Example:* “By increasing productivity and creating new roles in technology management and human-centered services, automation fosters economic growth and job creation.”  
- **Provide a forward-looking recommendation:**  
  *Example:* “To fully realize these benefits, workers and policymakers must invest in reskilling and lifelong learning to adapt to the evolving labor market.”  

**Putting it together (sample revised conclusion):**  
“Overall, while automation disrupts some jobs in the short term, its long-term impact on employment is positive. By increasing productivity and creating new roles in technology management and human-centered services, automation fosters economic growth and job creation. To fully realize these benefits, workers and policymakers must invest in reskilling and lifelong learning to adapt to the evolving labor market.”

            # STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 13/25 - The central stance (automation enhances employment) is present but expressed unclearly and inconsistently, with unsupported and off-track claims (e.g., “It can cause many stealing cases and robber becoming popular in future”). Ideas are underdeveloped and often hard to interpret.
- Organization: 12/25 - Paragraphing exists but lacks clear topic sentences and logical flow. Ideas jump from translation to office apps to crime without clear links (“Then, some official work has be replaced by AI already” followed by crime predictions).
- Vocabulary: 10/25 - Frequent inaccurate, unnatural, or vague word choices (e.g., “bossiness” for businesses; “losing six” likely intended “system failures”; “low layer” for lawyer). Overuse of general terms like “many” and “people,” and misused technical terms reduce clarity.
- Grammar: 8/25 - Numerous errors in verb forms, articles, prepositions, word order, and sentence structure (e.g., “it can easily to slow,” “has be replaced,” “AI translate can make sure correctly”). Errors significantly impede understanding.
- **Original Essay Total: 43/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 23/25 - Clear, balanced thesis and well-developed arguments. The essay argues: “despite short-term job displacement, automation will enhance global employment prospects by increasing productivity and creating new roles in technology supervision and human-centered services.” It acknowledges challenges and responds with policy and skill-development solutions.
- Organization: 24/25 - Strong structure: clear introduction with thesis, focused body paragraphs (“The primary benefit of automation…,” “However, the transition also poses significant challenges…,” “To harness the benefits and mitigate the risks…”), and a cohesive conclusion that restates the thesis and provides a forward-looking recommendation.
- Vocabulary: 23/25 - Precise, formal, topic-appropriate language (“economic efficiency,” “mismatched labor market,” “human-centered services,” “reskilling programs”). Terminology is accurate and varied.
- Grammar: 24/25 - High accuracy with varied sentence structures. Nearly error-free; complex sentences are used effectively.
- **Revised Essay Total: 94/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +51 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clear, defensible thesis explicitly stated in the introduction.
  - Strong topic sentences and coherent development within body paragraphs.
  - Substantial grammar and syntax improvement; errors removed and academic style adopted.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Limited use of concrete evidence (data, brief case examples) to substantiate claims about productivity and job creation.
  - The course’s current thematic focus (climate change and individual actions) appears misaligned with the essay topic (automation). If the assignment required climate change, topic alignment needs correction.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 11**
- **Conversation Quality: The student asked several targeted questions (thesis clarity, counterarguments, sentence structure, vocabulary, intro/conclusion). The assistant provided structured, detailed guidance and proposed a three-step revision workflow. However, the student did not engage in iterative revision within the chat (no shared revised sentences/topic sentences/paragraphs as part of the workflow).**

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Adequate depth with multiple focused questions. The assistant responses were detailed and rubric-based; the student’s engagement was question-driven but not iterative. Evidence: user queries on thesis consistency (Message 2), counterarguments (Message 4), sentence structure (Message 6), vocabulary precision (Message 8), and intro/conclusion (Message 10).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - The student requested options and analysis but did not explicitly evaluate, accept, or reject suggestions or demonstrate evidence-based decisions. Example: Assistant offered multiple rewrite options (e.g., for “Automation means…”), but the student did not respond with choices or rationale.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - The assistant proposed a three-step process (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph), but the chat shows minimal iterative revision. The revised essay is provided outside the visible step-by-step process; no in-chat revision cycles are documented.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear, well-argued revised thesis: The introduction presents a precise position with previewed reasons, improving argumentative focus.
- Effective organization: Each body paragraph advances a distinct, logical point with strong topic sentences and cohesive development.
- Substantially improved language control: Vocabulary is precise and formal; grammar accuracy and sentence variety greatly enhance professionalism.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Evidence and specificity: Integrate brief, concrete examples (e.g., industry cases of automation’s productivity effects, employment data/trends, named roles and growth statistics) to validate claims.
- Iterative collaboration: Engage in the structured revision workflow within the chat (post a sentence/paragraph; revise; reassess) to demonstrate and strengthen human-AI co-editing skills.
- Prompt alignment: Confirm assignment topic. If the module requires climate-change focus, adjust content to align; otherwise, note alignment in submissions to instructors.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The assistant repeatedly queried prompt alignment (climate change vs. automation), but the student did not clarify the assignment context.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The assistant outlined a three-step plan; the student did not commit to targets or a step-by-step revision path in chat.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - Student asked for alternatives but did not explicitly assess or decide among AI suggestions with justification.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The revised essay shows substantial independent improvement, suggesting effective application of guidance, though the process was not documented in chat.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. For essay writing: Add concise evidence and examples (e.g., cite a report showing productivity gains from automation, mention specific roles created like “AI operations analyst” or “maintenance technician”) to strengthen credibility.
2. For AI collaboration: Follow an explicit revision workflow in chat—post your thesis, revise it with feedback, then share a topic sentence and a full paragraph for iterative refinement; explain why you accept or reject AI suggestions.
3. Overall improvement: Clarify assignment prompt alignment early. If the course topic is climate change, adapt your thesis and examples to that domain; otherwise, note your chosen topic and goals to your instructor to ensure appropriate assessment.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student’s final essay quality is strong, with major improvements across all rubric areas. However, the chat history shows limited iterative revision and minimal critical engagement with AI suggestions. Also note potential misalignment with the course’s current theme (climate change); if the assessed task required that topic, this submission should be flagged for topic alignment guidance.

        **Assistant:** Original:

Automation means one provided us many benefits, including the world developed. If you ask me this technological shift ultimately causes enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term, I will answer it is enhance what the new can earn more money when which using less time and people. They want to win using easy way to get getting more advantages. AI Automation has been the suitable for them gains. Such as some translation work in the system global employment even at AI can not handle well as the human, to show emotion correctly. But in the other hand, AI translate can make sure correctly than the human, and tecnology developed fast and fast, it can easily to slow.

Then, some official work has be replaced by AI already. For example, some most, if not all people were using the I or AI apps to helping them done the work nowadays, such as some plan, excel and power powerful. Paying more money to people using AI, why the bossiness using it by themselves, some easy work can completely replace by AI.

But the professional work still need the high professional people to do the job, such as the low layer or accouting and and the eco in the employment. At court duty, learning of this kind is knowledge and the feeling to other situations. And reducing jobs, so it would make the poor people can't available to their life, the people The number of the people who lose their job will increasing in this trend. It can cause many stealing cases and robber becoming popular in future, not good for society safety.

Alough there was also many disadvantages of the automation, it will having two solutions to face the difficulties. If the AI replace many people work, also need the job or for using and control of the technology, and losing six need someone to fix at it. Even putting more job, but there also creating more job for society, we can following the trend. Change our view, learning more about the automation.

In the end, I have a number of the technology are bring to us, we also need the increasing ourself. Trying to learn how using AI or other technological shift, but not reliance with them, following the step of the world.


Revised:

The rapid advancement of automation and artificial intelligence is transforming the global workforce. While there is debate about its long-term impact on jobs, this essay argues that despite short-term job displacement, automation will enhance global employment prospects by increasing productivity and creating new roles in technology supervision and human-centered services.

The primary benefit of automation lies in its ability to boost economic efficiency and generate new job categories. By performing repetitive tasks faster and with fewer errors, technologies like AI reduce operational costs for businesses. This gain in productivity allows companies to scale and invest, fostering economic growth. Furthermore, while automation handles routine work, it simultaneously creates demand for new skills. For example, although AI translation tools excel in speed and consistency, they often fail to convey nuance and emotion, highlighting the enduring value of human linguists in creative and diplomatic fields. More directly, the deployment and maintenance of complex automated systems themselves generate employment for technicians, data analysts, and AI supervisors—roles that did not exist on the same scale a generation ago.

However, the transition also poses significant challenges, including the displacement of routine jobs and potential social inequality. For instance, AI has already automated many routine administrative tasks, such as data entry and basic scheduling. This displacement concentrates among workers in repetitive roles, potentially threatening livelihoods and exacerbating economic divides. While highly skilled professionals in fields like law, accounting, and economics remain less susceptible due to their reliance on complex judgment and emotional intelligence, the broader risk of a mismatched labor market persists. If not addressed through proactive measures, this could lead to sustained unemployment for vulnerable groups, undermining social stability.

To harness the benefits and mitigate the risks, a dual approach focusing on systemic support and individual skill development is essential. Governments and educational institutions must collaborate to provide robust reskilling programs and safety nets for displaced workers. On an individual level, adapting to the future of work means shifting one's mindset from fearing replacement to embracing collaboration with technology. This involves proactively learning to use AI tools to augment one's capabilities while cultivating uniquely human skills like critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence.

In conclusion, while automation disrupts certain job markets in the short term, its net effect on long-term global employment is positive due to gains in productivity and the emergence of new industries. This transition, however, requires concerted efforts in education and policy to ensure equitable access to new opportunities. Individuals, therefore, must proactively develop digital literacy and adaptive skills to thrive in the evolving economy, ensuring that the promise of automation leads to broadly shared prosperity.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-06T18:39:50.841Z

**You:** Please analyze my essay on the impact of automation on employment. What is my core thesis statement? Is it clearly stated in the introductory paragraph? Does my stance ('enhance') remain consistent throughout the entire essay?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T18:53:44.191Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing your draft and your questions. Before we start the three-step revision, let’s do the Preliminary Stage: negotiate targets and give diagnostic feedback. I’ll also answer your specific questions about your thesis and stance.

Negotiating Targets
- What would you most like to improve today? Possible goals: clarity and grammar, strength of argument, organization and logical flow, vocabulary precision, or academic style.
- Quick check: your course’s “current topic” mentions climate change and individual actions, but your essay is about automation and employment. Is your assignment topic definitely automation? If the climate-change prompt is the one you must answer, we should address the topic alignment first.

Diagnostic Feedback (based on your automation essay)
- Thesis & Argument (Content and Ideas): Your intended thesis appears to be “automation will enhance global employment prospects in the long term.” You also acknowledge disadvantages and propose solutions. Strength: you attempt a clear stance and consider both sides. Area to improve: the thesis is not clearly or confidently stated in one precise sentence, and the argument sometimes contradicts itself. Likely rubric level: Developing (around 3), but lower if off-topic for the assigned prompt.
- Organization & Logical Progression: You have multiple paragraphs, but topic sentences are unclear, and ideas jump without smooth transitions. Some claims (e.g., AI replacing official work; crime increasing) are not logically connected or explained. Likely level: Basic–Developing (2–3).
- Evidence & Development: You offer examples (translation, office tasks), but they’re general, unclear, or not supported with specific evidence or reasoning. Explanations need clarification. Likely level: Basic–Developing.
- Vocabulary: You use topic terms (automation, AI), but many word choices are inaccurate or confusing (e.g., “enhance what the new can earn more money,” “low layer”). Aim for precise, academic vocabulary. Likely level: Basic (2).
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Frequent errors make meaning hard to follow (verb forms, articles, word order). This reduces clarity significantly. Likely level: Limited–Basic (1–2).
- Alignment to Prompt (important if your task is climate change): If your assignment requires the climate change topic, your current essay is off-topic. That would heavily affect the Content & Ideas score. Please confirm the correct prompt.

Direct answers to your questions
- What is my core thesis statement? Core thesis (as I read it): “Automation will enhance global employment prospects in the long term.” You also suggest it may create new jobs even as it replaces some existing ones.
- Is it clearly stated in the introductory paragraph? Not clearly. The introduction contains your stance, but it’s embedded in unclear phrasing and does not appear as one strong sentence that previews main points.
- Does my stance (“enhance”) remain consistent throughout the essay? Not fully. At times you claim automation reduces jobs and may increase crime, which contradicts “enhance.” Later you return to the idea of creating jobs. So the stance wavers.

Student Priority Selection
Which two or three targets would you like to focus on today? Options:
1) Clarify and strengthen the thesis statement
2) Make the stance consistent across the essay
3) Improve organization with clear topic sentences
4) Enhance paragraph coherence (explanations and evidence)
5) Grammar accuracy
6) Vocabulary precision

Please choose your top targets. Also, confirm the assignment prompt (automation vs. climate change). Once we agree on the targets, we’ll begin Step 1 with your thesis statement.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T18:54:12.373Z

**You:** I mentioned the drawbacks of automation (e.g., unemployment, crime). Is my way of addressing these counterarguments effective? Does this content strengthen my argument or weaken the main logical thread? How can I better integrate or respond to these opposing viewpoints?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T18:56:01.502Z

**Assistant:** Great to meet you, and thank you for sharing your draft and questions. I’ll keep things supportive and focused. Before we start the three-step revision workflow, let’s complete the Preliminary Stage.

Negotiating Targets
- What would you most like to improve today? Options:
  1) Clarity and grammar
  2) Strength of argument
  3) Organization and logical flow
  4) Vocabulary precision
  5) Academic style (formal tone, hedging, cohesion)
- Important: Your course’s “current topic” mentions climate change and individual actions, but your essay is about automation and employment. Which prompt are you required to answer for this assignment? If it’s the climate-change prompt, we should address topic alignment first.

Diagnostic Feedback (on your automation essay)
- Thesis & Argument (Content and Ideas): I read your intended thesis as “automation will enhance global employment prospects in the long term.” Strength: you take a stance and consider the opposite view. Needs work: the thesis isn’t clearly stated in one precise sentence, and your stance sometimes wavers (e.g., predicting crime increases without linking it back to your main claim). Likely rubric level: Developing (around 3), but lower if off-topic for the assigned prompt.
- Organization & Logical Progression: Paragraphs exist, but topic sentences are unclear and ideas jump (e.g., from AI translation to office apps to crime). Transitions and logical links need strengthening. Likely: Basic–Developing (2–3).
- Evidence & Development: Examples are very general and sometimes inaccurate or unclear. Claims need explanation and, where possible, simple supporting evidence or concrete examples. Likely: Basic–Developing.
- Vocabulary: Good attempt to use topic terms (automation, AI), but many word choices are inaccurate or confusing, which affects clarity. Aim for simpler, precise wording. Likely: Basic (2).
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Frequent errors in verb forms, articles, word order, and sentence boundaries make meaning hard to follow. Likely: Limited–Basic (1–2).

Your question about counterarguments
- Is your treatment of counterarguments effective?
  - Partially. You mention unemployment and social risks, which shows awareness. However:
    - The claims aren’t clearly connected to your thesis (long-term employment prospects).
    - Some claims are too broad (e.g., “crime will increase”) and not supported, which can weaken your credibility.
    - You present disadvantages but don’t consistently explain why they do not outweigh your main claim.
- Does it strengthen or weaken the logical thread?
  - As written, it tends to weaken it because it shifts focus away from employment and introduces unsupported social predictions. It also makes your stance look inconsistent.
- How to integrate counterarguments better (simple, reliable approach):
  1) Make one clear concession that is directly related to your thesis.
     - Example frame: “It is true that automation will displace some routine roles in the short term, particularly in X.”
  2) Limit the counterargument with scope or conditions.
     - “However, this impact is concentrated in routine, predictable tasks.”
  3) Refute or outweigh it with your main reasons and any simple evidence.
     - “At the same time, automation raises productivity and creates demand for new roles in Y and Z (e.g., system maintenance, data work, human-centered services).”
  4) Reaffirm your thesis clearly.
     - “Therefore, while short-term disruption is real, the long-term outlook for employment is positive.”
- Useful language for concession + refutation:
  - Concession: “It is true that…,” “Admittedly…,” “Critics point out that…”
  - Turn: “However, this does not mean…,” “Nevertheless…,” “In the long term…”
  - Reaffirm: “Therefore…,” “Overall…,” “On balance…”
- Tip: Avoid unsupported social predictions (e.g., crime). Keep the counterargument strictly tied to employment. If you keep it, use cautious wording: “may,” “could,” and connect it back to your thesis with a solution (e.g., reskilling, safety nets).

Student Priority Selection
Please choose your top 2–3 targets for today so I can tailor the guidance:
- 1) Clarify and strengthen the thesis statement
- 2) Make the stance consistent across the essay
- 3) Improve organization with clear topic sentences
- 4) Enhance paragraph coherence (explanations and evidence)
- 5) Grammar accuracy
- 6) Vocabulary precision

Two quick questions so we can begin Step 1:
1) Which prompt are you writing on for this assignment: automation/employment or climate change and individual actions?
2) Based on the targets above, which would you like to focus on first?

If you confirm the prompt and targets, we’ll move to Step 1 (Thesis Statement Revision). I’ll ask you to share your current thesis in one sentence, and we’ll refine it together. Would you like to proceed that way?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T18:56:28.092Z

**You:** Please evaluate my sentence structures. Are there too many simple sentences or repetitive patterns? Are there any long, convoluted, or grammatically problematic sentences (e.g., 'it can easily to slow,' 'why the bossiness using it') that affect professionalism? Please provide a few different rewriting options for me to choose from.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T19:00:01.376Z

**Assistant:** Great to meet you, and thanks for sharing your draft. Let’s complete the Preliminary Stage before we start the three-step revision workflow.

Negotiating Targets
- What would you most like to improve today? Options:
  1) Clarity and grammar (including sentence structure)
  2) Strength and consistency of argument
  3) Organization and logical flow
  4) Vocabulary precision
  5) Academic style (formal tone, cohesion)
- Important: Your course’s “current topic” is climate change and individual actions, but your essay discusses automation and employment. Which prompt are you required to answer for this assignment? If you need to write about climate change, we should fix topic alignment first.

Diagnostic Feedback (based on your automation essay)
- Thesis & Argument (Content and Ideas): You seem to argue that automation will enhance long-term employment overall, with some short-term job losses. Strength: you attempt a clear stance and mention counterarguments. Needs work: the thesis is not clearly stated in one precise sentence; stance sometimes wavers. Likely rubric level: Developing (around 3) if on-topic; much lower if the assigned prompt is climate change.
- Organization & Logical Progression: Paragraphs exist but topic sentences are unclear; ideas jump (translation → office apps → crime) without linking logic. Likely: Basic–Developing (2–3).
- Evidence & Development: Examples are general and sometimes unclear. Claims about crime lack support and drift from the employment focus. Likely: Basic–Developing (2–3).
- Vocabulary: Good attempt to use topic terms, but many words/phrases are inaccurate, which hurts clarity. Likely: Basic (2).
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Frequent problems with verb forms, articles, prepositions, word order, and run-ons. This is the main barrier to clarity. Likely: Limited–Basic (1–2).

Your specific question: sentence structure evaluation
- Are there too many simple sentences? Not exactly. The main issue is a mix of fragments, run-ons, and long, convoluted sentences that are hard to follow. Some sentences try to do too much; others are incomplete.
- Repetitive patterns? Yes, several sentences start with “But” or “Then,” and some ideas repeat without adding new information.
- Problematic examples:
  - “it can easily to slow” → incorrect verb pattern (should be “can easily slow down”).
  - “why the bossiness using it” → word choice and form errors (“businesses,” “use,” sentence structure).

Below are a few high-impact sentences from your draft with multiple rewrite options. Choose the option that best matches your meaning and tone, or use them as models to craft your own version.

1) Original: “Automation means one provided us many benefits, including the world developed.”
- Option A (clear, simple): “Automation has provided many benefits and supported global development.”
- Option B (more academic): “Automation has delivered significant benefits, contributing to global economic and technological development.”
- Option C (balanced): “Despite its risks, automation has brought substantial benefits and accelerated development worldwide.”

Quick sentence-structure tips you can apply immediately
- One main idea per sentence. If a sentence has multiple ideas, divide it or use clear connectors (because, although, therefore).
- Keep subject–verb pairs close, and choose a clear subject (e.g., “AI,” “companies,” “automation”).
- Prefer active voice: “AI automates routine tasks” (not “routine tasks are automated by AI” unless you need the passive).
- Use consistent parallel structures (e.g., “to operate, monitor, and repair”).
- Review common patterns:
  - Modal + base verb: “can slow down,” “can reduce,” not “can to slow.”
  - Article use: “the technology,” “a job,” “an effect.”
  - Prepositions: “rely on,” “replace by/with,” “depend on.”

Student Priority Selection
- Please confirm the assignment prompt (automation/employment vs. climate change and individual actions).
- Choose your top 2–3 targets from the earlier list so we can focus our work.
- When you’re ready, share your thesis as one clear sentence. Then we will begin Step 1 (Thesis Statement Revision). If you want, pick one of the thesis options above as a starting point, or draft your own, and I’ll help you refine it.

**You:** Please circle words in the essay that are inaccurate, unnatural, or highly repetitive (e.g., frequent use of 'get,' 'many,' 'people'; 'bossiness,' 'losing six' might be typos). Provide more precise, formal alternatives for these words.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T19:02:45.938Z

**Assistant:** Great to meet you, and thank you for sharing your draft. Let’s complete the Preliminary Stage before we start the three-step revision workflow.

Negotiating Targets
- What would you most like to improve today? Options:
  1) Clarity and grammar
  2) Strength and consistency of argument
  3) Organization and logical flow
  4) Vocabulary precision
  5) Academic style (formal tone, cohesion)
- Important: Your course’s “current topic” is about climate change and individual actions, but your essay discusses automation and employment. Which prompt are you required to answer for this assignment? If you need to write about climate change, we should fix topic alignment first; being off-topic can significantly lower your score.

Diagnostic Feedback (based on your automation essay)
- Thesis & Argument (Content and Ideas): You seem to argue that automation will enhance long-term employment overall while acknowledging short-term job losses. Strength: you try to take a clear stance and mention counterpoints. Needs work: the thesis is not stated clearly in one sentence, and your stance wavers when you predict negative social effects without linking them back to your main claim. Likely rubric level: Developing (around 3) if on-topic; much lower if the assigned prompt is climate change.
- Organization & Logical Progression: You have paragraphs, but topic sentences are unclear and ideas jump (translation → office apps → crime). Transitions and logical links need strengthening. Likely: Basic–Developing (2–3).
- Evidence & Development: Examples are very general or unclear (e.g., “official work,” “crime increasing”). Claims need explanation and, where possible, simple evidence or concrete examples. Likely: Basic–Developing (2–3).
- Vocabulary: You use topic words (automation, AI), but many choices are inaccurate or unnatural, which affects clarity. Aim for simpler, precise words. Likely: Basic (2).
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Frequent errors in verb forms, articles, word order, and run-ons make meaning hard to follow. This is the main barrier to clarity. Likely: Limited–Basic (1–2).

Your vocabulary request: inaccurate/unnatural/repetitive words and better alternatives
Below are words/phrases from your draft that are inaccurate, unnatural, or overused. I list clearer, more formal options. Choose the ones that best fit your meaning.

- get (very general) → obtain, receive, achieve, gain, earn, secure, acquire, become (choose based on context)
- many → numerous, several, a number of, multiple, a considerable number of, substantial
- people → workers, employees, individuals, consumers, citizens, employers, policymakers (use the specific group)
- bossiness → businesses, firms, companies, employers, organizations
- losing six (likely a typo) → system failures, downtime, when systems fail, outages
- AI translate → machine translation, AI-powered translation
- official work → administrative work, clerical tasks, back-office tasks, routine office tasks
- the system global employment → the global labor market, global employment, global workforce
- can not handle well as the human → cannot handle as well as humans, is less effective than humans at
- show emotion correctly → convey tone and nuance accurately, capture nuance and emotion
- in the other hand → on the other hand, conversely
- tecnology developed fast and fast → technology is advancing rapidly, technology is evolving quickly
- has be replaced → has been replaced, is being replaced
- I or AI apps → AI apps, AI tools, AI applications
- some plan, excel and power powerful → planning tools, Excel, and PowerPoint; spreadsheets and presentation software
- why the bossiness using it by themselves → therefore businesses use it; which is why companies adopt it
- the professional work → professional work, specialized work
- low layer → lawyer; or the field: law/legal profession
- accouting → accounting
- the eco → economics (the field), or economists (people)
- at court duty → in legal practice, in court, in legal proceedings
- can’t available to their life → cannot afford basic needs, cannot sustain their livelihoods
- stealing cases and robber → theft and robbery, property crime
- society safety → public safety, community safety
- Alough/Although there was also many disadvantages → Although automation has disadvantages
- it will having two solutions → there are two solutions, this can be addressed in two ways
- If the AI replace many people work → If AI replaces many tasks/roles/jobs
- also need the job or for using and control of the technology → new jobs are needed to operate and supervise the technology
- need someone to fix at it → need technicians to maintain and repair it
- Even putting more job, but there also creating more job → While some jobs are removed, others are created
- we can following the trend → we can follow this trend, we can adapt to this trend
- Change our view, learning more about the automation → We should change our perspective and learn more about automation
- Trying to learn how using AI → We should learn how to use AI
- not reliance with them → without overreliance on them, avoiding overreliance
- following the step of the world → keeping pace with global trends, staying up to date

If you’d like, I can show you how to replace a few of these directly in your sentences once we choose our focus area.

Student Priority Selection
Please confirm two things so we can begin Step 1 next:
1) Which prompt are you required to answer: the climate-change prompt or the automation/employment topic?
2) Choose your top 2–3 targets for today from:
   - Clarify and strengthen the thesis statement
   - Make the stance consistent across the essay
   - Improve organization with clear topic sentences
   - Enhance paragraph coherence (explanations and evidence)
   - Grammar accuracy
   - Vocabulary precision

Once you confirm the prompt and targets, we’ll start Step 1. I’ll ask you to share your thesis as one clear sentence, and we’ll refine it together. Would you like to proceed that way?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T19:03:11.271Z

**You:** Does my introduction effectively engage the reader and introduce the topic? Does my conclusion powerfully summarize the argument and leave a lasting impression? Please provide specific suggestions for strengthening these two sections.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T19:06:38.116Z

**Assistant:** Great work sharing your draft and your questions. I’ll keep things friendly and focused. Before we begin the three-step revision workflow, let’s complete the Preliminary Stage.

Preliminary Stage — Negotiating Targets and Diagnosing the Essay

1) Negotiating targets
- Which skills would you most like to improve today? Please choose your top 2–3:
  1) Clarify and strengthen the thesis statement
  2) Make the stance consistent across the essay
  3) Improve organization with clear topic sentences
  4) Enhance paragraph coherence (clear explanations/evidence)
  5) Grammar accuracy
  6) Vocabulary precision
- Important: Your course’s current topic is about climate change and individual actions, but your essay is about automation and employment. Which prompt are you required to answer for this assignment? If you must write about climate change, we should fix the topic first to avoid a low score for being off-topic.

2) Diagnostic feedback (brief and clear)
- Thesis & Argument (Content and Ideas): You seem to argue that automation will enhance long-term employment overall, but your stance sometimes shifts (e.g., predicting more crime). Strength: you attempt a clear viewpoint and mention a counterargument. Needs work: make the thesis one precise sentence and keep the stance consistent. Likely rubric level: Developing (around 3) if the topic is correct; much lower if off-topic.
- Organization & Logical Progression: You have paragraphs, but topic sentences are unclear and ideas jump (translation → office apps → crime). Needs clearer structure and links. Likely: Basic–Developing (2–3).
- Evidence & Development: Examples are very general or unclear. Claims need simple, specific explanation and, where possible, brief evidence. Likely: Basic–Developing (2–3).
- Vocabulary: Good attempt to use topic terms, but many word choices are inaccurate or unnatural. Aim for simpler, precise words. Likely: Basic (2).
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Frequent errors make meaning hard to follow (verbs, articles, word order). This is the main barrier to clarity. Likely: Limited–Basic (1–2).

Focused feedback on your Introduction and Conclusion (as you asked)

Introduction
- What works:
  - You point to a big idea (automation and its benefits).
  - You try to take a stance about long-term employment.
- What to improve:
  - Start with a clear, simple context sentence (what automation is and why it matters).
  - State one precise thesis sentence (your position + main reasons).
  - Avoid vague or incorrect phrases (e.g., “including the world developed”).
- A simple, reliable structure for your intro:
  - Hook/context (1 sentence): Define the topic briefly.
  - Narrow the focus (1 sentence): Indicate the debate or key issue.
  - Thesis (1 sentence): Your clear position + 2 reasons that preview your structure.

- Model sentence frames you can adapt (choose one and rewrite in your words):
  - Context: “Automation—the use of AI and machines to perform tasks—has expanded rapidly in many industries.”
  - Issue: “This change raises a key question about its long-term impact on jobs.”
  - Thesis (option A, direct): “In the long term, automation will enhance global employment because it boosts productivity and creates new roles.”
  - Thesis (option B, balanced): “Although automation displaces some routine work in the short term, it will improve overall employment prospects by increasing efficiency and generating new kinds of jobs.”

Conclusion
- What works:
  - You try to end with advice (learn to use AI but avoid overreliance).
- What to improve:
  - Restate your thesis clearly (not just “technology brings benefits”).
  - Summarize your two main reasons, not new ideas (avoid introducing crime or unrelated points at the end).
  - End with a forward-looking implication or recommendation that matches your essay’s focus.
- A simple, reliable structure for your conclusion:
  - Restate thesis (1 sentence): Start with “Overall,” or “On balance,” to show your final position.
  - Synthesize key reasons (1–2 sentences): Briefly remind the reader of your main points.
  - Final implication/recommendation (1 sentence): A practical or forward-looking statement.

- Model sentence frames you can adapt:
  - Restate thesis: “Overall, despite short-term disruption, automation will strengthen employment in the long run.”
  - Synthesize reasons: “It raises productivity, lowers costs, and creates demand for new roles in maintenance, data, and human-centered services.”
  - Recommendation: “Therefore, workers and policymakers should invest in reskilling so that more people benefit from the jobs automation creates.”

Student priority selection
- Please confirm:
  1) Which prompt are you required to answer (automation/employment or climate change and individual actions)?
  2) Your top 2–3 targets from the list above.
- After you confirm, we will begin Step 1 of the revision workflow.

Main Workflow: Three-Step Revision Process (we will start after you confirm)

Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision
- Please share your thesis as one sentence now (your best attempt). Use one of the frames above if helpful.
- I’ll give quick feedback on clarity, strength, and focus.
- You’ll then try a revised version. We’ll confirm you’re happy with it before moving on.

Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision
- Choose one body paragraph to work on first.
- Share its current topic sentence, and we’ll strengthen its link to your revised thesis.

Step 3 — Revising the Rest of the Chosen Paragraph
- We’ll check supporting sentences for clarity, unity, and coherence.
- I’ll ask guiding questions and give hints so you can make focused improvements.

Would you like to confirm the prompt and your top targets now? Also, would you like to try rewriting your thesis sentence using one of the models above?
