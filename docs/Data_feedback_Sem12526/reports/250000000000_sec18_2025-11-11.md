            ## Contribution Analysis

            You’ve done solid work revising the thesis and topic sentence, which shows growing confidence and clarity. The key next step is fully revising the body paragraph that follows this topic sentence to strengthen your support and coherence, as per the assessment report.

Here’s a focused plan to revise the body paragraph about individual actions:

---

### Step 3: Full Body Paragraph Revision Guidance

**Current paragraph excerpt:**  
> On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

**Revision approach:**

1. **Start with your improved topic sentence:**  
   *On a smaller scale, individual actions can help in the overall goal of encouraging eco-friendly practices.*

2. **Clarify and expand your supporting ideas:**  
   - Explain *why* small actions matter (e.g., influence social norms, consumer demand).
   - Give examples to support these reasons.
   - Acknowledge challenges but frame them calmly and logically, with clear transitions.

3. **Use clearer and more grammatically correct sentences:**  
   Replace informal or awkward phrases (“this is problem,” “so it not really enough”) with polished language.

4. **Add linking words for flow:**  
   E.g., “However,” “Moreover,” “Therefore,” to connect ideas smoothly.

---

### Example Revised Paragraph (model for you):

> On a smaller scale, individual actions can help in the overall goal of encouraging eco-friendly practices. When many people choose to recycle, conserve water, or use alternative transportation such as walking, they set a positive example for others and reduce their personal environmental impact. Moreover, widespread consumer demand for green products encourages companies to adopt more sustainable business practices, as they seek to attract environmentally conscious customers. However, some people may be reluctant to change their habits because it requires effort or is less convenient. Despite these challenges, even small individual actions are important because they contribute to a larger cultural shift toward sustainability. Together with government policies, personal behavior can help build a stronger response to climate change.

---

### How to proceed:

- Try rewriting your paragraph now, focusing on the points above.
- If you want, share your revised paragraph in parts (one or two sentences at a time).
- I can provide targeted feedback to help polish grammar, coherence, and vocabulary.
  
Would you like to start with rewriting the first two supporting sentences after your topic sentence? Or if you prefer, share your full draft paragraph and I can help you revise it step-by-step.

### ESSAY REVISION TASKS CHECK

**Required Tasks:**
1. Revised the thesis statement: **COMPLETED**
   - The student provided a clearer and more confident thesis, moving from “I partly agree...” to “I strongly agree that citizens can influence the government, but I think personal choices are important too.”
2. Revised one of the topic sentences: **COMPLETED**
   - The student worked through multiple drafts and arrived at “On a smaller scale, individual actions can help in the overall goal of encouraging eco-friendly practices.”
3. Revised one of the body paragraphs: **NOT COMPLETED**
   - While the student attempted to review supporting sentences, there is no evidence in the chat nor in the revised essay of a substantive body paragraph revision. The revised essay’s paragraph about individual actions remains unchanged from the original, except for the topic sentence.

**Status:** not finished

- **Refining Process:** 3/5  
  *Justification:* Good iterative cycles for thesis and topic sentence, but the refining process did **not** extend to full paragraph revision. The body paragraph did not undergo the recommended sentence-level reworking or full integration of feedback.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total:** **11/15**

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- **Willingness to Engage:** Student actively asks for feedback and clarification (e.g., “I need more help”), showing motivation to improve.
- **Responsiveness to Feedback:** Multiple exchanges demonstrate genuine effort to incorporate AI suggestions.
- **Improved Clarity in Structure:** The revised topic sentence shows better logical alignment and flow.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- **Full Paragraph Revision:** Student did not complete the revision of supporting sentences/body content. (Recommendation: go beyond topic sentence to edit and strengthen supporting ideas and details.)
- **Proofreading and Grammar:** Persistent errors suggest need for more attention to editing and proofreading sentences for accuracy.
- **Vocabulary Variety:** Revision phase could include attempts to diversify word choice, use more topic-specific language.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision:** **Good**  
  *Evidence:* Student responds to prompts about thesis focus and paragraph selection, but could provide more detailed self-assessment.
- **Strategic Planning:** **Developing**  
  *Evidence:* Student follows AI’s suggested steps but does not independently propose next steps for full paragraph revision.
- **Critical Evaluation:** **Good**  
  *Evidence:* Student questions strength of statements, e.g., “make significant differences,” and seeks help when uncertain.
- **Independent Editing:** **Developing**  
  *Evidence:* Several revisions are AI-prompted; student attempts own rewrites but relies on guidance especially for topic sentence.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing Skills:**  
   - Prioritize full paragraph revision, including supporting evidence, examples, and transitions for improved clarity and development.
   - Dedicate time to grammar and sentence error correction after main ideas are revised.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills:**  
   - Share more information about your revision goals (e.g., what you struggle with) to help AI tailor feedback.
   - Be proactive and take initiative in suggesting next steps, such as full paragraph revisions, beyond what the AI prompts.
3. **Overall Improvement:**  
   - After revising thesis/topic sentences, always revise the rest of the paragraph for coherence and detail.  
   - Try to use more varied and precise vocabulary in each revision round.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- Student shows consistent engagement with AI and is trainable; good candidates for modeling critical review and revision process.
- Needs encouragement and coaching to complete *all* required revision steps, especially full paragraph editing.
- With guidance, can achieve further improvement in organization and language use—consider additional scaffolding for grammar and independent editing.  
- Next session: focus on guiding the student through sentence-level and supporting idea revision to complete the paragraph drafting process.

---

**Progress Status:** NOT FINISHED — The student must revise at least one full body paragraph, not just the topic sentence, to complete the module requirements.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:48:29.245Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:59:17.258Z

**Assistant:** Great work sharing your thesis statement! Here’s the thesis you’re currently using:

> I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

Let’s review it together. Here are some notes for improvement based on your course expectations:

**Clarity & Strength:**  
- The main argument is clear, but the wording is a bit long and could be made more direct.
- It contains two points, which is good, but they could be previewed more explicitly.
- Avoid phrases like “I partly agree…” because they can make your thesis sound hesitant. Instead, state your position more confidently.

**Focus:**  
- Consider more precise language (“citizens can still influence the government” could become “citizens play a crucial role in shaping government policies…”)
- Can you briefly preview what your main arguments/paragraphs will be? This helps guide the reader.

Would you like to revise your thesis to make it more confident and clear? Try rewriting it, and I’ll review your new version! If you need some help starting, I’m here to give a few model phrases (but I want you to try first).

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:59:20.711Z

**You:** I strongly agree that citizens can influence the government, but I think personal choices are important too.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:01:30.211Z

**Assistant:** Nice work taking a step toward a stronger thesis! Let’s look at your revised version:

> I strongly agree that citizens can influence the government, but I think personal choices are important too.

Here’s some feedback to help you refine it further:

**Strengths**
- Your position is more confident—great job removing “I partly agree.”
- You mention both citizens influencing government and personal choices, which matches your essay content.

**Suggestions**
- The thesis could be more specific and preview how you’ll support your viewpoint.
- Avoid beginning with “I strongly agree that…” Instead, directly state your argument as a general statement.
- Try to include phrases that link both ideas (“While government action is essential, individuals play key roles…”).
- Preview how you’ll expand on these two points (government influence and personal action).

**Guiding Question:**  
Can you try rewriting your thesis to combine these improvements? For example, can you specify how citizens influence government policy and what types of personal choices matter?

Would you like to try revising it now? I’m here to help!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:01:33.129Z

**You:** I'm reading to consider my topic sentences.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:04:05.667Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! Before we move on, let’s make sure you’re satisfied with your revised thesis. If you’d like to share your new version now, I can review it once more.

Otherwise, let’s start on **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**.

**Instructions:**
1. **Pick one body paragraph to revise the topic sentence.**  
   - You wrote about citizens influencing government and personal lifestyle choices.  
   - Which paragraph would you like to work on first? (The first body paragraph about influencing government, or the second about personal choices?)

2. **Share the current topic sentence from that paragraph.**  
   - Paste it here and I’ll give you specific feedback on how well it connects to your (revised) thesis.

Which paragraph would you like to focus on for topic sentence revision? Please let me know, and then share that topic sentence!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:04:08.862Z

**You:** Let's move on to step 2. 

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:04:53.939Z

**Assistant:** Great choice! You’ve selected the topic sentence from your second body paragraph, focusing on personal lifestyle choices:

> On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.

Let’s review this topic sentence using your revised thesis:

**Strengths:**
- It clearly transitions to the idea of individual action.
- It mentions specific examples, which helps the reader understand your focus.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
1. **Connection to Thesis:**  
   - Try to link this sentence more directly to your thesis by stating *why* personal choices matter (even if they are less impactful).
   - Consider using a phrase that previews the main idea you’ll address in the paragraph (for example, how individual actions have influence, even if limited).

2. **Generalization First:**  
   - Start with a more general statement about individual responsibility or impact, and introduce the examples after.

**Guiding Question:**  
- Can you revise this topic sentence to make the connection to your thesis even clearer, and mention the effect of individual choices (even if small)?  
For example, can you first state the value of individual actions before listing the examples?

Would you like to try rewriting this topic sentence now? If you’d like, I can offer a couple of starter phrases for you!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:04:57.591Z

**You:** Individual actions can make significant differences towards waste reduction and overconsuption by taking actions like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:12:15.560Z

**Assistant:** Great effort trying a revision! Let’s look at your new topic sentence:

> Individual actions can make significant differences towards waste reduction and overconsumption by taking actions like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.

Here are some helpful comments and guiding questions:

**Strengths:**  
- You start with the idea that individual actions have an impact, which helps connect to your thesis.
- You list relevant examples, showing specific personal choices.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**  
1. **Clarity & Focus:**  
   - The phrase “make significant differences” might be a bit strong, since your thesis recognizes that individual actions are useful but less impactful than government action.
   - Focus the topic sentence on how personal choices contribute positively, even if they are not the main solution.

2. **Generalization:**  
   - Try not to immediately list examples; save those for the supporting sentences.
   - You could mention why these small changes matter (such as creating positive habits, influencing companies, or setting examples), before giving details.

**Guiding Questions:**  
- Can you rephrase the topic sentence so it more carefully matches your thesis—suggesting that personal choices have some influence, even if limited?  
- Try to sum up the paragraph’s main idea in a single, clear sentence before listing examples.

Would you like to revise your topic sentence one more time? If you want, I can give a couple of model sentence starters!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:12:18.763Z

**You:** Others believe that small changes in one's own life can make a difference--though it's impact isn't entirely known.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:14:10.167Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing your revised topic sentence:

> "Others believe that small changes in one's own life can make a difference--though its impact isn't entirely known."

**Feedback:**

**Strengths:**
- You’re introducing the idea that individual actions could contribute, which shows both sides—as your thesis does.
- You are careful not to overstate the impact (good!).

**Suggestions:**
- The phrase “Others believe…” distances your own voice from the argument. Since your thesis includes that individuals play a role, try to connect this topic sentence more directly to *your own* viewpoint rather than stating it as "what others believe."
- Instead of focusing on the uncertainty of the impact, try to focus the sentence on the *potential benefits* of individual choices, even if limited.
- For clear flow, try a sentence that summarizes how individual actions can support the overall fight against climate change.

**Guiding Question:**
- How can you state that individual actions contribute positively—according to your argument—even if they aren’t the biggest factor?

**Would you like to try rewording your topic sentence** so it more directly connects to your thesis and is stated from *your* point-of-view?  

For example, you might start with:  
- “Although individual choices may have less impact than government policies, they still contribute to addressing climate change by…”  

Would you like to give it another try? I’m happy to help further if you need ideas!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:14:15.324Z

**You:** I need more help.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:15:04.232Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely—no problem at all! You’re doing great, and it’s normal to need a bit more guidance.

Let’s break it down together. For a good topic sentence in this paragraph, you want to:

- Connect directly to your thesis (show personal choices matter—even if their impact is smaller).
- Use your own voice; not “others believe,” but your own point-of-view.
- Make a general claim about the value or role of individual action, *before* listing specific examples.

**Here’s a starter formula you might use:**
“While individual actions cannot solve climate change alone, making positive lifestyle changes still plays a useful part in protecting the environment.”

Or you could try:
“Even though personal choices may seem less powerful than government action, they are still important for encouraging eco-friendly practices and setting examples for others.”

**Your turn:**  
Would you like to try rewriting your topic sentence using one of these starters, or making up your own based on this structure?  
Just start with a general statement about the value of individual action, and you can add examples in your next sentences.

Let me know what you come up with, and I’ll help you polish it further!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:15:08.078Z

**You:** On a smaller scale, individual actions can help in the overall goal of encouraging eco-friendly practices.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:16:24.135Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic—this revised topic sentence is clear, focused, and connects directly to your thesis! Well done!

**Strengths:**
- You start with “On a smaller scale,” which acknowledges that individual actions are less impactful than large-scale efforts—matching your thesis.
- The phrase “can help in the overall goal of encouraging eco-friendly practices” communicates the positive, contributive role of personal choices without overstating their effect.
- You use your own voice, which is perfect.

Would you like to make any final tweaks, or are you happy to use this as your improved topic sentence? If you’re satisfied, let’s move on to revising the supporting sentences in this paragraph.

---

**Step 3: Revising the Rest of the Paragraph**

Let’s look at the rest of your paragraph (the one about individual lifestyle choices):

> On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

**Guiding Revision Questions:**
- Do all the supporting sentences directly relate to your new topic sentence?
- Are your examples specific and clearly explained?
- Could any ideas be clarified or made more logical?

**Suggestions:**
1. Make sure your first supporting sentences give reasons or explanations before offering examples.
2. When you mention both benefits and limitations, signal the contrast clearly.
3. Expand on how individual choices help (e.g., set examples, encourage companies) and then discuss the challenges.

Would you like to try revising a couple of your supporting sentences now to make sure everything ties back strongly to your improved topic sentence?  
If you want, you can share just one sentence at a time and I’ll give focused feedback!

Let’s make your paragraph as clear and unified as possible. Would you like to begin with the next sentence after your topic sentence?
