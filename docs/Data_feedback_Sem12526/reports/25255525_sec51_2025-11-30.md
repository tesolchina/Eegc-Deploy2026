            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for sharing your essay and the full assessment context. Here’s a focused, actionable summary of what you’ve done well and what to do next, drawing on the instructor’s recommendations and the chat history:

---

### What You’ve Done Well
- **Thesis Revision**: You transformed a vague, hedged thesis into a confident, specific statement that previews your two main points: displacement of routine workers and increased employment pressure.
- **Topic Sentence**: You crafted a clear, focused topic sentence for the first body paragraph that links directly to your thesis and frames the paragraph’s argument effectively.
- **Paragraph Revision Process**: You’ve engaged deeply with feedback and guidance, making multiple attempts at revising the paragraphs about job losses and education/upskilling.
- **Iterative Collaboration**: You have worked step-by-step through the revision plan, showing good strategic planning and openness to revision.

---

### What To Focus on Next

**1. Provide Concrete Examples and Evidence**  
- Add one or two brief, concrete examples or statistics to support claims. For example:  
  - “For instance, the automotive industry has replaced many assembly line jobs with robots, leading to immediate job losses.”  
  - “In IT sectors, workers must acquire advanced programming certifications, which can cost thousands of dollars and take months—barriers for many.”  
- This strengthens your content by turning general claims into persuasive arguments.

**2. Final Copy-Edit for Grammar and Clarity**  
- Run a thorough grammar and punctuation check. Watch for:  
  - Correct use of commas (e.g., avoid run-ons or comma splices).  
  - Capitalization at the start of sentences and proper nouns.  
  - Subject-verb agreement (e.g., “automation **makes**” not “make”).  
  - Clear phrasing (replace vague or awkward expressions like “education is forced into involution” with simpler alternatives like “education faces overcrowding” or “degree inflation”).  
- Consider using a grammar checking tool (like Grammarly or Microsoft Editor) as a final step.

**3. Tighten Paragraph Unity and Logical Flow**  
- Each paragraph should:  
  - Start with a strong topic sentence that connects to the thesis.  
  - Have 2–3 sentences developing that claim with clear support (examples, explanation).  
  - End with a sentence that ties the paragraph back to your main argument.  
- Avoid repeating ideas. Each sentence should add a new point or explanation.

**4. Improve the Conclusion**  
- Make your final paragraph more than a restatement of the thesis.  
- Synthesize the two main points you’ve discussed and offer a clear, reasoned judgment or policy suggestion. For example:  
  - “While automation has spurred new opportunities through upskilling, the barriers many workers face mean that without targeted support, overall employment prospects will decline. Governments and companies should invest in accessible retraining programs and balance technological adoption with worker protections to create a fair labor market.”

---

### Next Steps Recommendation:

- **Revise the education/upskilling paragraph using the 3-sentence structure:**  
  1. Topic sentence acknowledging upskilling but stating its limits.  
  2. Example or reason explaining why not all workers can transition successfully.  
  3. Tie-back showing this limitation contributes to long-term harm.  

- **Add 1–2 brief, concrete examples to your body paragraphs (first and second).**  
- **Do a focused line-edit pass or use an automated grammar tool for punctuation, capitalization, and sentence clarity.**  
- **Rewrite your conclusion to synthesize your argument and propose a clear takeaway or recommendation.**

---

If you want, I can help you draft:  
- A polished paragraph on education/upskilling using the templates.  
- One or two specific example sentences for the job loss paragraph.  
- A stronger concluding paragraph.

Just say which you want to tackle first!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The original states a clear position that automation will harm employment, but ideas are underdeveloped, repetitive, and lack supporting examples or explanation.
- Organization: 15/25 - Paragraphs show an attempt at structure (problem → counterpoint → conclusion) but sentences repeat ideas, topic sentences are weak, and transitions are poor.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Limited range and some inaccurate word choices (e.g., "multi..", "involution") that reduce clarity.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Frequent errors in punctuation, capitalization, agreement, and sentence structure that impede readability.
- **Original Essay Total: 61/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The thesis is much clearer and previews two reasons: displacement of routine workers and increased employment pressure. The essay attempts balance by discussing upskilling, but claims remain general and need concrete evidence.
- Organization: 20/25 - The revised topic sentence for the first body paragraph (“By replacing many routine and dangerous tasks, automation increases job variety in some sectors but decreases opportunities for low‑skilled workers...”) anchors the paragraph and improves logical flow, but some paragraphs still contain mixed or repeating ideas.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Better use of specific terms (e.g., "routine," "low‑skilled," "skills mismatch," "upskill"), though occasional awkward phrases remain.
- Grammar: 18/25 - Noticeable improvement (capitalization, some sentence fixes), but many sentences still contain punctuation errors, run-ons, and informal constructions that reduce clarity.
- **Revised Essay Total: 79/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +18 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis: Moved from hedged and vague (“i think this technology shift will undermine...”) to a confident, previewing thesis: “I strongly agree with the idea that automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long term by displacing routine workers and increasing employment pressure.” (chat evidence: user's revised thesis at 2025-11-29T16:28:55.398Z)
  - Topic sentence: First body paragraph revised to a clear, focused topic sentence: “By replacing many routine and dangerous tasks, automation increases job variety in some sectors but decreases opportunities for low‑skilled workers...” (chat evidence: user's topic sentence at 2025-11-29T16:37:01.730Z)
  - Paragraph-level editing: The student revised the second (education/upskilling) paragraph several times to better link upskilling to limits and consequences, showing iteration and clearer focus even though further tightening is needed (revised paragraph present in the final essay).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Use concrete evidence: no statistics, studies, or concrete industry examples were added to support claims (assistant suggested templates such as “For example, [industry]…” but these were not filled with real-world detail).
  - Grammar and sentence-level polishing: many sentences still need punctuation fixes, correction of run-ons, capitalization, and clearer phrasing (e.g., replace “Education is forced into involution” with a clearer term).
  - Stronger concluding synthesis: the final paragraph repeats the thesis but does not synthesize the two strands into a persuasive, evidence-backed final judgment or policy recommendation with detail.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 21**
- **Conversation Quality:** Focused, iterative, and task-oriented. The AI set a clear revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), and the student followed it, repeatedly submitting rewrites and accepting guidance. Exchanges include targeted templates, example phrasings, and the student’s multiple drafts.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - The chat contains 21 turns, extended iterative work over multiple steps, and focused guidance across thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph revision. Evidence: multi-step plan and repeated drafts (assistant initial plan at 2025-11-29T16:25:37.395Z; many follow-ups through 2025-11-29T16:44:59.313Z).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - The student engaged with AI suggestions actively, produced revisions based on templates, and chose which suggestions to accept (e.g., adopting the stronger thesis and the revised topic sentence). However, there is limited explicit rejection or deep critique of suggested alternatives (the student generally followed guidance rather than debating or providing independent critique).
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - Clear iterative cycles: thesis rewrite, topic-sentence rewrite, and multiple drafts of the body paragraph. The assistant provided incremental templates and the student repeatedly revised text (evidence: successive submissions of thesis, the topic sentence, and paragraph drafts across the chat).
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear adoption of structure and process: The student followed the AI’s stepwise plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) and implemented concrete changes (e.g., new thesis and topic sentence).
- Ability to revise: The student produced multiple improved drafts and accepted stylistic and structural suggestions (thesis and topic sentence revisions are good evidence).
- Goal focus: The student clearly stated the revision priority (“clarify of argument”) and stayed on that target throughout the dialogue.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Add evidence and examples: Incorporate specific industry examples, data, or studies to support claims (e.g., automation in manufacturing or retail) to strengthen Content and Ideas.
- Sentence-level editing: Systematically address punctuation, capitalization, run-ons, and phrasing. A final copy-edit pass is needed.
- Tighten coherence and synthesis: Make the counterpoint (upskilling) clearly contextualized and show why it does not fully offset the harm using concrete barriers (training cost, time, geographic mismatch).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the essay and specified the revision target (“clarify of argument”), enabling focused assistance.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student followed the AI’s staged plan and proceeded sequentially across the thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Developing/Good - The student accepted and applied suggestions but rarely provided explicit critique of alternative AI proposals; some independent choices were made (e.g., moving to next step).
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The student produced original rewrites rather than copying AI output verbatim and iterated on language.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Add specific, credible evidence: cite a brief statistic, study, or concrete industry example to support claims about displacement and skills mismatch.
2. Do focused grammar editing: perform a line-edit pass to fix punctuation, capitalization, subject-verb agreement, and run-on sentences; consider using an automated grammar tool as a final check.
3. Strengthen paragraph unity and synthesis: ensure each paragraph begins with a tight topic sentence, follows with 2–3 concrete, logically sequenced supporting sentences, and ends with a sentence tying back to the thesis.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student successfully completed the AI-assigned revision tasks (thesis, topic sentence, and at least one body paragraph) and demonstrated effective iterative collaboration.
- The main remaining weaknesses are lack of concrete evidence and recurring mechanical errors; a focused revision session on integrating one or two brief citations and a final copy-edit would substantially raise the essay score.
- The chat shows strong engagement and appropriate use of AI as a coach rather than a generator — a positive model for AI-assisted revision pedagogy.

A coin has two sides. Automation is generally replacing some simple, handy work with our technology developed quickly, while some workers lose their job and the employment pressure was more serious .it's no doubt that automation decreases the global employment now ,and i think this technology shift will undermine global employment prospects in the long term.
Automation replaces simple and dangerous job , making the job more diverse and multi..Automation refresh the world and change the rule .this change make us reflect and create new work which is more detailed and makes the employment system more delicate .in the long term , more and more people will go these newly created jobs  and be in a more comfortable work environment, but i think this will not make up for the people who lose job in the end.
From my perspective, another point is that although automation make employment more serious, it can boost our education and create more talent in advanced areas. More and more people will enhance themselves to avoid being replaced by automation , this will also increase our employment level. People study and work hard, but they can't find job after they graduate. it is what we have faced, and this problem will last for many years in the future. This situation also makes people more and more tired of finding jobs and work.
From two points above, I think automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long term. to solve that, I think we should balance the automation and human ,find a situation that benefits both sides. Another important point is making the employment environment more comfortable and relax. Enhancing is a good thing ,but too much is not.



Revised:
As technology advances, automation is transforming industries. I strongly agree with the idea that automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long term by displacing routine workers and increasing employment pressure

By replacing many routine and dangerous tasks, automation increases job variety in some sectors but decreases opportunities for low‑skilled workers — a change that contributes to the broader skills mismatch and harms long‑term employment prospects. This change makes us reflect and create new work which is more detailed and makes the employment system more delicate, more and more people will go to these new created jobs and be in a more comfortable work environment, but i think this will not make up for the people who lose jobs in the end.
From my perspective, automation can boost our education and create more talent in advanced areas. Because employers demand new technical skills, workers must upskill to remain employable so that machines won’t replace them. However, this will also increase our employment level. Education is forced into involution. People study and work hard, but they often struggle to find a job after graduation. It is what we have faced, and this problem will last for many years in the future. This situation also makes people more and more tired of finding jobs and working
From the two points above, I think automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long term. To solve that, I think we should balance the automation and the human,  find a situation that benefits both sides. Another important point is making the employment environment more comfortable and relaxed. Enhancing is a good thing, but too much is not.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-29T16:25:37.395Z

**You:** i think this technology shift will undermine global employment prospects in the long term.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T16:27:10.349Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s get started. First, I want to learn about your goals so we can focus the session.

1) Negotiating targets
- What do you most want to improve in this essay today? (Choose one or two: clarity of argument, thesis strength, paragraph organization, use of evidence, grammar/word choice, or style/tone.)
- Any personal goals for this writing task or things your teacher will mark you on?

2) Quick diagnostic feedback (brief)
I read your draft. Here’s a short diagnosis using the rubric headings:

- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: You state a clear position (automation will harm global employment).
  - Areas to improve: The thesis is hedged (“i think”) and doesn’t preview the main reasons you’ll discuss. It should be more confident and specific.

- Organization
  - Strengths: You attempt logical progression (problem, possible benefit, conclusion).
  - Areas to improve: Paragraphs repeat ideas and lack clear topic sentences that tie back to the thesis. Transitions are weak.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: You mention two plausible points (job loss; education/upskilling).
  - Areas to improve: Claims are general and unsupported by examples or explanation. Need clearer development of how each point supports the thesis.

- Language Use
  - Strengths: The meaning is usually recoverable.
  - Areas to improve: Many grammar, punctuation, capitalization, and word-choice errors distract the reader. Sentence structure and word form need work.

3) Student priority selection
- Which of these would you like to focus on in this session? (Pick up to two: solidifying the thesis, improving one paragraph’s topic sentence and content, or fixing grammar in that paragraph.)
Please confirm which target(s) you choose.

Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 1 (Thesis). You already shared your current thesis: “i think this technology shift will undermine global employment prospects in the long term.” I’ll respond in Step 1 after you confirm your chosen targets. Would you like to focus on the thesis and one body paragraph’s development?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T16:27:23.362Z

**You:** clarify of argument

*Time:* 2025-11-29T16:27:50.153Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — that’s a clear goal. I’ll help you sharpen the argument so your essay says exactly what you mean and shows why you believe it.

First, quick confirmation and one brief question
- Do you want us to focus on: (A) solidifying the thesis statement and (B) revising one body paragraph’s topic sentence and content so it clearly supports that thesis? (I’m assuming yes based on “clarify of argument.”)
- Which body paragraph would you like to work on after the thesis — the first paragraph about job losses, or the second about education/upskilling?

Brief reminder of the diagnosis (very short)
- Main strength: You have a clear overall position (automation will harm employment).
- Main weaknesses for our target: Your thesis is hedged and doesn’t preview main reasons; paragraphs repeat ideas and lack clear topic sentences that connect to the thesis; explanations are general and need clearer links to the claim.

Step 1 — Thesis feedback and a short template to guide your rewrite
You wrote: “i think this technology shift will undermine global employment prospects in the long term.”
What to improve:
- Remove hedging: don’t use “I think.” Use a confident verb or statement.
- Be specific: say briefly why or how automation will undermine employment.
- Preview the main points you’ll develop (so the reader knows the essay’s structure).
- Fix capitalization and punctuation.

Guiding template (fill the blanks; this is a structure, not a complete rewritten sentence):
- [Strong claim about automation’s impact: e.g., “Automation will …”] + because + [main reason 1: immediate effect, e.g., widespread displacement of low-skill jobs] + and + [main reason 2: longer-term effect, e.g., failure of upskilling/new jobs to fully replace those losses or timing/mismatch problems].
Example fragments you can use in the blanks: undermine/erode/reduce; displace/replace; mismatch between skills and new jobs; insufficient time/training; uneven benefits across industries.

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using that template? Type your revised thesis and I’ll give quick feedback. Also tell me which paragraph (first or second) you want to revise next.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T16:28:02.666Z

**You:** I strongly agree with the idea that automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long term by displacing routine workers and increasing employment pressure

*Time:* 2025-11-29T16:28:55.398Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that revised thesis is a big improvement: confident and it previews two clear reasons (displacement of routine workers; rising employment pressure). Before we move on, a couple quick checks so we stay focused.

1) Confirm targets
- Do you want to focus on:
  A) solidifying the thesis (we’ve just revised it), and
  B) revising one body paragraph’s topic sentence and content (choose one)?
- Which paragraph would you like to work on next: the first body paragraph about job losses, or the second about education/upskilling?

2) Quick praise and one small suggestion about your new thesis
You wrote: “I strongly agree with the idea that automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long term by displacing routine workers and increasing employment pressure.”

What’s good:
- Confident tone (no hedging).
- Previews two main reasons — that helps readers follow your essay.

One tiny wording suggestion (optional): “increasing employment pressure” is okay, but you could make that clearer with phrases such as “increasing unemployment and job insecurity” or “exacerbating unemployment.” Would you like to keep your exact sentence or tweak it to one of these alternatives?

3) Updated full essay with your new thesis inserted
(You made a specific edit to the thesis, so here’s the full essay text with that change included. I did not change any other sentences yet.)

Next step (Step 2 — Topic sentence)
- Which paragraph would you like to revise: the first (job losses) or the second (education/upskilling)?
- When you tell me, I’ll ask you to paste the paragraph’s current topic sentence (or point to which sentence you want to be the topic sentence). Then I’ll give brief feedback and a short template to help you rewrite it so it connects clearly to your revised thesis.

Would you like to try drafting the new topic sentence now? If so, write one sentence that links to the thesis (mention displacement or job insecurity, for example), and I’ll give quick feedback.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T16:29:15.065Z

**You:** move to step 2:Automation replaces simple and dangerous job , making the job more diverse and multi..Automation refresh the world and change the rule

*Time:* 2025-11-29T16:30:16.582Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for picking the first body paragraph. That sentence you pointed to looks like it’s meant to be the paragraph’s topic sentence, so let’s work on making it clear, direct, and tightly connected to your revised thesis (automation displacing routine workers and increasing job insecurity).

Quick feedback on your current sentence
- Strengths: You’re trying to say automation changes work and replaces simple or dangerous jobs — that’s a useful point that can support the thesis.
- What to fix:
  - Grammar and word choice: “job” should be “jobs”; “multi..” is unclear; “refresh the world and change the rule” is vague.
  - Focus: A topic sentence should state one clear claim that directly links to the thesis. Right now it mixes several ideas and doesn’t explicitly connect to job displacement or rising unemployment.
  - Clarity: Use more precise terms (“routine,” “low-skilled,” “dangerous”) and a clear result (e.g., “leads to job loss” or “increases unemployment/job insecurity”).

A short template to help you rewrite (fill the blanks)
- “Automation [verb] [which type of jobs], causing [effect] and contributing to [link to thesis].”
Possible phrases to use in the blanks:
- Verbs: replaces, displaces, removes
- Types of jobs: routine/manual/low-skilled jobs; dangerous or repetitive tasks
- Effects: immediate job losses; fewer available entry-level jobs; increased unemployment/job insecurity
- Link to thesis: “thereby undermining employment prospects” or “contributing to long-term unemployment and insecurity”

Two short sentence fragments you can borrow (not full replacements — use them as building blocks)
- “by displacing routine and low-skilled workers”
- “this leads to immediate job losses and greater job insecurity”

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now using the template? Paste your new single-sentence topic sentence and I’ll give quick feedback.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T16:30:28.896Z

**You:** By replacing many routine and dangerous tasks, automation increases job variety in some sectors but decreases opportunities for low‑skilled workers — a change that contributes to the broader skills mismatch and harms long‑term employment prospects.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T16:37:01.730Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that topic sentence is clear, focused, and directly tied to your thesis. Good job connecting the immediate effect (fewer opportunities for low‑skilled workers) to the bigger problem (skills mismatch and long‑term harm).

Quick, gentle feedback and tiny options (you don’t have to change anything)
- Strengths: It names the types of jobs affected, acknowledges a short-term positive (job variety), and links to the skills mismatch and long‑term prospects — exactly what we want a topic sentence to do.
- Small wording ideas (optional): you could make “decreases opportunities” more specific (e.g., “reduces entry‑level jobs” or “limits openings for low‑skilled workers”), and consider replacing the dash with a short connector (e.g., “and” or “which”) if you want a slightly more formal tone. But your sentence as written works well.

Step 3 — Revising the rest of this paragraph
Next, let’s make sure the supporting sentences clearly develop that claim. I’ll guide you with focused prompts and short templates; please try revising the paragraph after that.

Focus each supporting sentence on one of these moves:
1) Give a brief, specific example or fact that shows displacement (industry or job type).
   - Template: “For example, [industry/place] has replaced [routine job] with [automation], which [result].”
2) Explain why the new jobs don’t fully replace the old ones (skills mismatch, time lag, training costs, fewer openings).
   - Template: “Because [reason], the new positions often require [different skills/certifications], so [consequence for displaced workers].”
3) Link back to your thesis clearly: show how those effects add up to harm long‑term employment prospects.
   - Template: “Together, these trends [phrase], undermining long‑term employment prospects.”

Guiding questions as you revise each sentence
- Does this sentence make the connection to the topic sentence explicit?
- Is there a concrete example or clear explanation (not just a general claim)?
- Does each sentence stick to one idea and flow logically into the next?
- Do you end the paragraph by tying the details back to the thesis?

Would you like to try revising the supporting sentences now? Paste the paragraph’s current supporting sentences (or your revised version) and I’ll give quick, specific feedback and point out any grammar or clarity fixes. If you want, I can then insert your accepted topic sentence plus your revised paragraph into the full essay.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T16:37:25.470Z

**You:** By replacing many routine and dangerous tasks, automation increases job variety in some sectors but decreases opportunities for low‑skilled workers ,a change that contributes to the broader skills mismatch and harms long‑term employment prospects.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T16:40:19.946Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that topic sentence is focused and clearly tied to your thesis. Small copy-editing suggestion (only if you want it): fix spacing and hyphenation so it reads smoothly. One corrected version you can accept or ignore:

"By replacing many routine and dangerous tasks, automation increases job variety in some sectors but decreases opportunities for low‑skilled workers, a change that contributes to a broader skills mismatch and harms long‑term employment prospects."

I’ve inserted that (with the thesis we already revised) into your full essay below so you can see how it fits. I didn’t change any other sentences.

Step 3 — Next move: revise the supporting sentences (your turn)
I’ll guide you, but please try revising the rest of that paragraph first. Use one sentence for each move below:

1) Give a short, specific example showing displacement:
- Template: "For example, [industry/place] has replaced [routine job] with [automation], which [result]."

2) Explain why new jobs don’t fully replace old ones (skills mismatch, training time/cost, fewer openings):
- Template: "Because [reason], the new positions require [different skills/certifications], so [consequence for displaced workers]."

3) Tie the details back to the thesis:

**You:** move tostep three:From my perspective, another point is that although automation make employment more serious, it can boost our education and create more talent in advanced areas. More and more people will enhance themselves to avoid being replaced by automation , this will also increase our employment level. People study and work hard, but they can't find job after they graduate. it is what we have faced, and this problem will last for many years in the future. This situation also makes people more and more tired of finding jobs and work.

**Assistant:** Thanks — helpful move. Before I revise anything, one quick clarification so we stay on the agreed plan:

- Do you want me to focus Step 3 on the second paragraph you just pasted (the paragraph about education and upskilling)? Earlier we worked on the first paragraph; now you’ve pasted the second. Please confirm which paragraph you want to finish in Step 3: the first (job losses) or the second (education/upskilling).

If you confirm the second paragraph, here’s a short, focused diagnosis and a clear, doable plan to revise it yourself (I’ll guide and give templates — please try the rewrites and paste them back).

Brief diagnosis of the pasted paragraph
- Strengths: It raises an important counterpoint — automation can encourage education and higher-skilled jobs — which can balance your argument.
- Areas to improve for our targets (clarity, paragraph development):
  - Topic sentence is weakly linked to the thesis (it says automation “can boost our education” but doesn’t show how this affects long-term employment prospects).
  - Sentences are repetitive and vague (e.g., “enhance themselves,” “increase our employment level”).
  - No clear explanation of why upskilling often fails to fully replace lost jobs (time, cost, mismatched skills, limited openings).
  - Grammar and punctuation errors make the logic harder to follow.

Step 3: What to write now (please try this)
Revise this paragraph with 2–3 focused sentences that do these three moves. Keep each sentence focused on one idea.

1) Brief topic sentence that links to the thesis
- Template: “Although automation can encourage upskilling and create advanced roles, [limitation that links to thesis].”
(You can reuse this if you like, but please rewrite it in your own words.)

2) Concrete example or reason why upskilling helps but is limited
- Template: “For example, [industry] now requires [new skill/certificate], so workers must [retrain/get degrees], which [costs/time/limits access].”

3) Clear explanation tying back to thesis (why this does not fully prevent harm)
- Template: “Because [reason: training cost/time/skills mismatch/fewer openings], many displaced workers cannot transition, so automation still threatens long‑term employment prospects.”

Try to write 2–3 sentences now using those templates. Keep each sentence short and explicit. Paste your revised sentences here and I’ll give quick feedback on clarity, logic, and language and then we’ll insert them into your essay if you’re happy.

If you want a single short model sentence for inspiration, say “hint” and I’ll give one. But try writing first — you’ve got this!

**You:** From my perspective, automation can boost our education and create more talent in advanced areas. Because employers demand new technical skills, workers must upskill to remain employable so that machines won’t replace them. However, this will also increase our employment level.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T16:42:07.902Z

**Assistant:** Good work — thanks for trying those revised sentences. Quick confirmation: we’re focusing Step 3 on the second body paragraph (the one about education/upskilling). Below I’ll give brief, focused feedback and short templates to help you try another revision. Then I’ll paste the full essay with your new paragraph inserted so you can see how it fits.

Brief, focused feedback on your three sentences
- Strengths: You made the point that upskilling is a response to automation and that employers want new technical skills. That supports your essay’s balance and shows you understand the issue.
- Main problems to fix:
  1. The paragraph needs a clearer link to your thesis (explain why upskilling often cannot fully prevent long‑term harm).
  2. The middle sentence is a bit wordy and slightly unclear in purpose — make it a direct cause/effect statement (employers demand X, so workers must do Y, which leads to Z).
  3. The final sentence (“However, this will also increase our employment level.”) is vague and contradicts your thesis unless you explain its limits. If you mean “it helps, but not enough,” say that and explain why (time/cost/limited openings, skills mismatch).

Three short templates to rewrite each sentence (fill the blanks)
1) Topic sentence that links to the thesis:
- “Although automation can encourage upskilling and create advanced roles, [limit that connects to thesis].”
(e.g., “Although automation can encourage upskilling and create advanced roles, these gains are limited for many displaced workers.”)

2) Concrete reason/example why upskilling helps but is limited:
- “For example, [industry] now requires [new skills], so workers must [retrain/get certifications], but [cost/time/access] often prevents many from making the transition.”
(e.g., “For example, manufacturing now requires programmers and technicians, so former assembly-line workers must retrain — a process that takes time and money.”)

3) Clear tying sentence that shows the net effect on long-term employment:
- “Because [reason], many displaced workers cannot move into new roles, so automation still [verb phrase that matches your thesis].”
(e.g., “Because of these barriers, many displaced workers are left behind, so automation continues to undermine long‑term employment prospects.”)

A few tiny grammar/wording notes you can apply immediately
- Avoid “From my perspective” — it’s okay to be direct: “Although automation can…”
- “This will also increase our employment level” is unclear — decide whether you mean “increase employment” (positive) or “increase pressure on employment” (negative), and make the limit explicit.
- Use concrete nouns: “upskill,” “retrain,” “technical skills,” “entry‑level jobs,” “skills mismatch.”

Full essay with your recent second paragraph inserted (I did not change anything else)
---
A coin has two sides. Automation is generally replacing some simple, handy work with our technology developed quickly, while some workers lose their job and the employment pressure was more serious. it's no doubt that automation decreases the global employment now, I strongly agree with the idea that automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long term by displacing routine workers and increasing employment pressure.
By replacing many routine and dangerous tasks, automation increases job variety in some sectors but decreases opportunities for low‑skilled workers, a change that contributes to a broader skills mismatch and harms long‑term employment prospects. Automation replaces simple and dangerous job , making the job more diverse and multi..Automation refresh the world and change the rule .this change make us reflect and create new work which is more detailed and makes the employment system more delicate .in the long term , more and more people will go these newly created jobs  and be in a more comfortable work environment, but i think this will not make up for the people who lose job in the end.
From my perspective, automation can boost our education and create more talent in advanced areas. Because employers demand new technical skills, workers must upskill to remain employable so that machines won’t replace them. However, this will also increase our employment level.
From two points above, I think automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long term. to solve that, I think we should balance the automation and human ,find a situation that benefits both sides. Another important point is making the employment environment more comfortable and relax. Enhancing is a good thing ,but too much is not.

**You:** MOVE TO STEP 4:From my perspective, automation can boost our education and create more talent in advanced areas. Because employers demand new technical skills, workers must upskill to remain employable so that machines won’t replace them. However, this will also increase our employment level. Education is forced into involution. People study and work hard, but they often struggle to find a job after graduation.

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for the update and for pasting your revised paragraph. Quick confirmation so I stay on track:

- Confirmed targets: we’re focusing on (1) the thesis (already revised) and (2) revising the second body paragraph (education/upskilling). Is that right?
- I’ll only guide changes to that one paragraph now; when you paste your revision I’ll give focused feedback and templates to help you try another revision.

Brief, focused diagnosis of the paragraph you pasted
Text you gave:
"From my perspective, automation can boost our education and create more talent in advanced areas. Because employers demand new technical skills, workers must upskill to remain employable so that machines won’t replace them. However, this will also increase our employment level. Education is forced into involution. People study and work hard, but they often struggle to find a job after graduation. It is what we have faced, and this problem will last for many years in the future. This situation also makes people more and more tired of finding jobs and working"

Strengths
- You raise a useful counterpoint: automation can encourage upskilling and advanced roles.
- You note the reality that employers demand new technical skills and that retraining is required.
- You also point to a real problem: graduates still struggle to find jobs, which supports the idea that upskilling is not a complete solution.

Main problems to fix (so the paragraph clearly supports your thesis)
1. Unity and focus: the paragraph mixes several ideas (benefit of upskilling, a positive claim about employment level, then negatives about graduates). Pick one clear claim per sentence and show how it connects to the thesis (that automation undermines long‑term employment prospects).
2. Contradiction/unclear wording: “However, this will also increase our employment level” contradicts your other sentences unless you explain limits. If you mean “it helps employment for some but not enough,” say that directly. Also “Education is forced into involution” is unclear — most readers won’t understand “involution” here.
3. Development: you need a short example or reason showing why upskilling often fails (cost, time, mismatch, fewer openings).
4. Grammar and style: some sentences are run-ons or missing punctuation; several phrases can be clearer and more formal (“From my perspective” → “Although” or “While”).

A short plan — keep this paragraph to 2–3 clear sentences
- Sentence 1 (topic sentence): Acknowledge upskilling but state its limit and link to the thesis.
- Sentence 2 (example/reason): Give a concrete reason why many workers cannot successfully upskill (cost/time/limited openings) or a concrete industry example.
- Sentence 3 (tie back): Conclude by showing why this means automation still threatens long‑term employment prospects.

Templates you can use — fill the blanks (don’t copy them exactly; rewrite in your own words)
1) Topic sentence:
- “Although automation can encourage upskilling and create advanced roles, [limit that connects to thesis].”
(e.g., “Although automation can encourage upskilling and create advanced roles, these benefits are limited for many displaced workers.”)

2) Example / reason:
- “For example, in [industry], employers now expect [technical skill], so workers must [retrain/get certification], but [cost/time/lack of access] often prevents them from doing so.”
(e.g., “For example, manufacturing increasingly requires programming and technical certificates, which cost time and money to acquire.”)

3) Tie-back:
- “Because [barrier], many displaced workers cannot transition into new roles, so automation still [verb phrase matching your thesis].”
(e.g., “Because of these barriers, many displaced workers are left behind, so automation continues to undermine long‑term employment prospects.”)

A few quick wording suggestions you can apply:
- Replace “From my perspective” with “Although” or “While” (stronger, more formal).
- Replace “increase our employment level” with a clearer phrase: “help some workers find higher‑skilled jobs” or “create jobs for some, but not enough to replace losses.”
- Replace “Education is forced into involution” — consider “degree inflation” or “overqualification” if that’s what you mean, but be sure to explain briefly.

Your turn — please try one revision now
- Using the templates above, write a 2–3 sentence version of the paragraph (each sentence short and clear).
- Paste it here and I’ll give quick, specific feedback (clarity, coherence, grammar). After you’re happy with it, I can insert the revised paragraph into the full essay on request.

If you’d like a single short example sentence to get unstuck, say “hint” and I’ll give one tiny model line — but try writing first. You’re very close; keep going!

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is helpful. Before we revise, two quick confirmations so we stay on track:

1) Confirm targets
- Do you want us to focus now on (A) keeping the revised thesis we already agreed on, and (B) revising this second paragraph (education/upskilling) for clarity, unity, and how it supports the thesis? Also tell me if you want me to help with grammar in this paragraph as we revise (yes/no).

2) Very brief diagnosis of the paragraph you pasted
- Strengths: You correctly raise that automation can encourage upskilling and that employers want new technical skills.
- Main problems to fix for our targets:
  - The paragraph lacks unity and contradicts itself (saying automation “increases employment” but also that graduates can’t find jobs).
  - It’s vague about why upskilling often fails (no concrete reason or example).
  - Some phrases are unclear or informal (e.g., “Education is forced into involution”; “From my perspective”).
  - Grammar/punctuation/run‑ons make the logic hard to follow.

If that matches what you see, we’ll revise the paragraph to 2–3 clear sentences that: (1) acknowledge the benefit of upskilling, (2) explain a clear limitation with a brief example or reason, and (3) tie that limitation back to the thesis (why automation still threatens long‑term employment).

Try this short 3‑sentence plan (fill the blanks in your own words):
1) Topic sentence (acknowledge benefit + state limitation)
- “Although automation can encourage upskilling and create advanced roles, [limit that connects to the thesis].”

2) Example/reason (concrete cause: cost/time/skills mismatch/fewer openings)
- “For example, in [industry], employers now expect [new skills], so workers must [retrain/get certification], but [cost/time/access] often prevents many from doing so.”

3) Tie‑back (explain the net effect on long‑term employment)
- “Because of these barriers, many displaced workers cannot move into the new roles, so automation still [undermines/harms] long‑term employment prospects.”

Would you like to try writing 2–3 sentences now using those templates? Paste them here and I’ll give quick, specific feedback and then we’ll polish grammar and wording together.

If you’d like a single short model sentence to get unstuck, say “hint” and I’ll give one tiny example.
