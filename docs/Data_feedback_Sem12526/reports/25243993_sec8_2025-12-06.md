            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for your progress so far! Here’s a suggested plan for paragraph 3 and the conclusion, to complete your essay with clear topic sentences and supporting ideas.

---

### Paragraph 3 — Topic: Retraining barriers and structural unemployment  
**Topic sentence options:**  
- Option A: “Limited retraining opportunities and skill mismatches mean many displaced workers cannot transition into new jobs, causing persistent structural unemployment.”  
- Option B: “Without effective education and policy interventions, automation’s pace often outstrips workers’ ability to adapt, deepening unemployment challenges.”  

**Supporting points (choose 2–3):**  
- Barriers to retraining: cost, age, education level, geographic immobility, time needed for new training.  
- Examples: older factory workers struggling with new skills; workers in declining industries or regions lacking retraining programs.  
- Policy angle: insufficient government and employer investment in retraining and upskilling; slow policy response.  
- Link back to thesis: these barriers prolong unemployment and worsen inequality, threatening long-term employment prospects.

**Transitions from paragraph 2:**  
“Finally,” “Another key issue is,” or “In addition,”

---

### Conclusion — Structure & options  
**Structure:**  
1) Restate thesis differently: automation improves efficiency but harms employment long-term due to job loss, inequality, and retraining gaps.  
2) Summarize main points briefly (1–2 sentences).  
3) Final thought with implication or policy recommendation.

**Concluding sentence options:**  
- Option A (Implication): “Therefore, despite its benefits, automation threatens the future of global employment unless urgent action is taken.”  
- Option B (Policy): “To secure employment prospects, policymakers and businesses must prioritize retraining, social protections, and equitable distribution of automation’s benefits.”

**Linking phrases for conclusion:**  
“In sum,” “Overall,” “For these reasons,” “Consequently,”

---

### Next steps:  
1) Please pick one option for paragraph 3’s topic sentence (A or B).  
2) Would you like to try drafting paragraph 3 (2–4 sentences) yourself next, or shall I produce a model draft you can revise?  
3) I can help you draft a concise conclusion after paragraph 3 is done.

You’re doing excellent work organizing your essay clearly. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The original draft had a clear position that automation undermines employment but offered weak development and few concrete reasons or examples. Evidence: “But in my point of view, it is more undermine global employment prospects.”  
- Organization: 15/25 - Structure was disjointed with weak paragraphing and no clear roadmap; the introduction and first paragraph did not flow well. Evidence: the essay jumps from a short intro into a long, run-on paragraph ending with “In the other hand,”.
- Vocabulary: 14/25 - Limited range and many spelling/word-choice errors (e.g., “technelogy,” “soviety,” “emplyment”). This distracts from the ideas.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 13/25 - Frequent errors (subject–verb agreement, run-ons, misspellings) that sometimes impede comprehension. Example: “it is more undermine global employment prospects.”
- **Original Essay Total: 59/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - Thesis and body paragraphs are much clearer and present plausible mechanisms (job displacement; inequality). For example, the revised thesis states: “Although automation increases efficiency, it undermines long-term global employment prospects by causing widespread job loss and widening the wealth gap.” The essay also develops two supporting paragraphs explaining displacement and inequality.
- Organization: 20/25 - Paragraphing and logical progression improved substantially in the body (clear topic sentences and linked supporting sentences). However, the introduction remained partly uncorrected (spelling/grammar issues), and the final paragraph and conclusion are incomplete, so overall organization is good but not excellent.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Stronger, more topic-specific language appears in the revisions (“widening the wealth gap,” “low‑skilled, routine workers,” “returns to capital”), though some informal phrasing and inconsistent hyphenation remain in parts of the essay still uncorrected.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 19/25 - The revised body paragraphs show clear grammatical improvement (fixed subject–verb agreement, removed run-ons, clearer sentence forms). However, the introduction still contains errors (e.g., “technelogy are being deveped in the soviety”), and some sentences could be tightened for formality.
- **Revised Essay Total: 80/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +21 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis strengthened and made specific: “Although automation increases efficiency, it undermines long-term global employment prospects by causing widespread job loss and widening the wealth gap.”
  - Clear topic sentence for the first body paragraph: “One major way automation undermines employment is by displacing low-skilled, routine workers.”
  - Two body paragraphs were developed with clearer examples and causal explanations (manufacturing/assembly-line replacement; technology and finance industries increasing returns to capital while reducing demand for routine labor).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The introduction still contains multiple spelling and grammar errors and should be fully proofread and rewritten to match the improved body quality.
  - Conclusion and third body paragraph on retraining/policy were not completed in final submitted text — add a paragraph on retraining barriers and a concluding paragraph summarizing claims and offering policy suggestions.
  - Add concrete evidence or data (a brief statistic or citation) to strengthen claims and increase persuasiveness.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 39** (student and assistant messages during the revision process)
- **Conversation Quality:** Highly interactive and iterative. The student followed a structured process with the assistant (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph support → paragraph 2 → planning paragraph 3 and conclusion). The chat shows stepwise drafting, targeted feedback, student rewrites, and final acceptance of AI revisions.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - Evidence: 39 exchanges (well above the “15–25+” benchmark), detailed stepwise guidance from the assistant, and multiple drafts from the student. Example flows: assistant’s multi-step plan at the start and repeated revision cycles (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph support, paragraph 2).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - The student actively edited and sometimes rewrote assistant suggestions rather than automatically accepting everything. Examples: the student produced multiple thesis drafts, revised the topic sentence and supporting sentences themselves, and chose revision strategies (e.g., “You can continue according to your suggestion”; choosing Option A for paragraph revision). However, much of the interaction involved accepting the assistant’s recommended structure and specific corrections with limited explicit critique of alternative approaches.
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - Strong iterative process with multiple meaningful revision cycles. Evidence: the student produced several drafts of the thesis and topic sentence, revised supporting sentences, and accepted an assistant-produced revision for paragraph 2 after selecting Option A. The assistant’s final version integrates student input and corrections.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear argumentative focus and improved thesis: the student moved from an unclear thesis to a concise, specific one that previews reasons.
- Effective iterative collaboration: the student engaged in many back-and-forth edits, demonstrating willingness to revise and incorporate feedback (39 exchanges).
- Development of logical and causal reasoning in body paragraphs: the student produced clear topic sentences and supporting explanations linking automation → job loss → inequality.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Proofreading and sentence-level accuracy: the introduction still contains spelling and grammar errors that must be corrected for final submission (e.g., “technelogy,” “soviety,” “transformig”).
- Complete the essay: finish paragraph 3 (retraining/policy) and write a concise conclusion that restates the thesis and suggests actions.
- Use concrete evidence: include at least one statistic, reputable example, or citation to strengthen claims about job losses or inequality.
- Formal tone and concise phrasing: avoid informal metaphors (“taste the sweetness”) and remove redundant sentences to tighten flow.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the original essay and specified revision targets (thesis + paragraph); the assistant’s plan was followed.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student adopted a staged revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → supporting sentences → paragraph 2), and made decisions (e.g., choosing Option A).
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good/Developing - The student questioned and iterated on AI suggestions (rewrote drafts), but largely accepted the assistant’s recommended direction without frequent counterproposals.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The student drafted multiple revisions and self-corrected several items (e.g., adjusting wording and hyphenation), showing growing editing autonomy.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Proofread and fully correct the introduction (spelling, grammar, and clarity) before final submission; ensure the introduction smoothly leads into the thesis and previews main points.
2. Complete the third body paragraph on retraining/structural unemployment and a one-paragraph conclusion that restates the thesis and offers a brief policy implication or recommendation.
3. Add one concrete piece of evidence (a statistic, study citation, or well-known example) to strengthen claims about job displacement or rising inequality; request the assistant to help find and cite a reputable source if needed.
4. Continue using the AI iteratively but ask for explicit alternatives and rationales (e.g., “Give me two different ways to phrase this sentence and explain the pros/cons”).

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student completed all three required revision tasks: revised the thesis, revised a topic sentence, and revised the first body paragraph. They also requested and accepted AI help to revise the second body paragraph and to plan the remainder of the essay.
- The student demonstrates good collaborative behavior and an effective revision workflow but should focus on final copyediting and completing remaining sections (paragraph 3 and the conclusion) before submission.
- Useful next assignment suggestion: require the student to submit a final polished version with the corrected introduction, completed paragraph 3, and a conclusion, plus one inline citation to a reputable source to support a central claim.

If you would like, I can:
- Produce a polished final draft that applies the remaining corrections (fix intro typos/grammar and add a conclusion), or
- Provide sentence-level corrections for the introduction only, or
- Help the student draft paragraph 3 and a concise conclusion now.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Nowadays, automation technelogy are being deveped in the soviety around the whole world. It transformig industries and reducing people's jobs for boosting the efficiency. Someone think that this technological shift enhance global emplyment prospects in long term. But in my point of view, it is more undermine global employment prospects.

When people first realize the situation on automation technology, they see how convenience they are. The technologies let people get free from work and also boosting the efficiency of work. They prababebly believe it is a good situation without any cons. But the truth——and also the biggest problem is that automation reduce many of jobs that make lots of poople can not get any saliry to support their family. People who didn't get high level education may lose the chance to work in the society, which means they lose the chance to take care of themselves and their family——They may not do well than automation, so how they can get money ? No way.

In the other hand,

Revised:
Nowadays, automation technelogy are being deveped in the soviety around the whole world. It transformig industries and reducing people’s jobs for boosting the efficiency. Someone think that this technological shift enhance global emplyment prospects in long term. Although automation increases efficiency, it undermines long-term global employment prospects by causing widespread job loss and widening the wealth gap.

One major way automation undermines employment is by displacing low-skilled, routine workers. For example, in manufacturing, many workers have been replaced by automation because machines are faster and cheaper than manual labor, particularly in assembly-line jobs. This change harms low-skilled workers, especially older workers and those with low levels of education, who often face unemployment. Because employers have less incentive to retrain staff and because training opportunities are limited, displaced workers frequently struggle to find new jobs. As a result, automation can lead to widespread unemployment and contributes to a long-term restructuring of the labor market.

Automation also exacerbates income inequality by creating high-paying roles for skilled workers while eliminating many low-wage jobs. For example, firms in the technology and finance sectors have increased output and profits by investing in AI and automated systems, reducing demand for human labor in routine tasks such as customer service, data entry, and basic trading. Because firms can substitute capital for routine labor, owners and highly skilled employees receive larger returns, while low-wage workers lose bargaining power and job opportunities. Consequently, many displaced workers become unemployed or accept lower-paid positions, widening the wealth gap and weakening overall demand for labor‑intensive goods and services, which further undermines long‑term employment prospects.

Therefore, while automation brings efficiency, its tendency to displace routine workers, widen inequality, and outpace retraining threatens long‑term employment unless policymakers and employers act.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-06T10:43:50.009Z

**You:** Step 1: Revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-12-06T10:44:30.591Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s start by setting clear goals and looking quickly at your draft so we can focus the revision work where it will help most.

1) Your goals
What would you most like to improve in this session? (Pick 1–2)
- Clarity and strength of your argument/thesis
- Paragraph structure and logical flow (topic sentences)
- Grammar and sentence accuracy
- Vocabulary (range and precision)
- Other (please say)

2) Quick diagnostic feedback (based on the rubric)
I read your draft. Here are the main strengths and the key areas to improve:

- Content & Ideas: Developing. You have a clear position (automation harms employment prospects), but the argument needs clearer development and more specific reasons/examples to be convincing.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Basic to developing. The introduction and opening paragraph are disjointed; transitions and paragraph structure need strengthening. There’s no clear roadmap of main points.
- Vocabulary: Basic with errors and some repetition (e.g., “boosting the efficiency,” “automation”). Choose more precise academic words and vary expressions.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Limited. Frequent grammar, word-choice, and sentence-formation errors (spelling, subject-verb agreement, article use, punctuation). These distract from your ideas.

Examples from the draft to notice:
- Your current thesis sentence: “But in my point of view, it is more undermine global employment prospects.” This shows your viewpoint but is grammatically weak and doesn’t preview the main reasons.
- Topic development: You raise good concerns (job loss, education gap) but don’t organize them into clear supporting points.

3) Choose the revision priorities (student choice)
Which of these diagnosed weaknesses would you like to focus on during this session? (Pick up to two so we can make real progress)
- Revise thesis so it’s clear, strong, and previews main points
- Improve one body paragraph’s topic sentence and unity
- Focus on grammar/sentence accuracy in that paragraph
- Improve vocabulary in that paragraph

Please confirm your choice(s).

4) Thesis: please share or confirm
Step 1 will be revising your thesis. Can you paste the exact sentence you want to use now as your current thesis? (I saw: “But in my point of view, it is more undermine global employment prospects.” — tell me if you want to keep that as your starting point or paste a different version.)

When you confirm your revision targets and paste the thesis, we’ll begin Step 1. Would you like to focus on thesis + one paragraph’s topic sentence (my recommendation), or focus on thesis + grammar?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T10:44:45.387Z

**You:** Step 1: Revise thesis statement

Nowadays, automation technelogy are being deveped in the soviety around the whole world. It transformig industries and reducing people's jobs for boosting the efficiency. Someone think that this technological shift enhance global emplyment prospects in long term. But in my point of view, it is more undermine global employment prospects.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T10:45:39.637Z

**Assistant:** Nice work so far — you’ve given me a clear draft to work with. Before we begin the three-step revision, we need to agree your targets and confirm what to work on. I’ll keep this short and supportive.

1) Choose your revision targets (pick up to two)
Which of these would you most like to focus on in this session?
- Revise thesis so it’s clear, strong, and previews main points
- Improve one body paragraph’s topic sentence and its connection to the thesis
- Strengthen the paragraph’s supporting sentences (clarity, unity, coherence)
- Fix grammar and sentence accuracy in that paragraph
- Improve vocabulary in that paragraph

My recommendation: thesis + one body paragraph’s topic sentence (this gives the biggest improvement to structure and argument in a short session). Do you agree, or pick different targets?

2) Confirm the thesis to start from
You gave this thesis in the draft: “But in my point of view, it is more undermine global employment prospects.”
Do you want to use that exact sentence as the starting point for revision, or paste a different version now? (If you keep it, we’ll work to make it clearer and preview your main points.)

3) Choose the paragraph to revise
Which paragraph do you want to work on?
- The paragraph that begins “When people first realize the situation on automation technology…” (recommended)
- Or a different paragraph? (If so, paste its first sentence.)

Once you confirm:
- Targets (1–2 choices),
- Which thesis sentence to start from, and
- Which paragraph to revise,

we’ll start Step 1 (thesis revision). Would you like to proceed with my recommendation (thesis + first body paragraph)?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T10:45:48.773Z

**You:** You can continue according to your suggestion

*Time:* 2025-12-06T10:47:27.906Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for agreeing to focus on the thesis plus the first body paragraph. That will give the biggest improvement to your essay’s clarity and structure.

Quick confirmation
- Targets we’ll work on: 1) Revise thesis so it’s clear, strong, and previews the main points. 2) Improve the topic sentence and the supporting sentences of the first body paragraph (the paragraph that begins “When people first realize the situation on automation technology…”).
- Starting thesis to revise: “But in my point of view, it is more undermine global employment prospects.” Is that correct? (I’ll treat that as the starting point unless you paste a different one.)

Step 1 — feedback on your current thesis
What’s working: I can see your position — you believe automation hurts global employment prospects. That’s a clear viewpoint.

What to fix:
- Grammar and wording: phrases like “But in my point of view” and “it is more undermine” are ungrammatical and weaken your authority.
- Focus and preview: right now your thesis states an opinion but doesn’t tell the reader why you think this. A strong thesis also previews the main reasons you will explain in the essay (usually 2–3).
- Tone: avoid hedging (“I think,” “maybe”). Use confident, precise language.

What to include in a revised thesis
- A clear statement of your position (automation harms employment).
- 2–3 specific reasons you will discuss (for example: displacement of low‑skilled workers, growing inequality, lack of retraining/education).
- A confident and concise phrasing.

Try revising now (your turn)
Please try rewriting the thesis yourself now. Use one of these short templates to help (fill the blanks with your reasons) — these are stems, not full rewrites, so you can adapt them to your voice:
- “Automation undermines global employment prospects by _____, _____, and _____.”
- “Although automation increases efficiency, it ultimately harms employment because _____, _____, and _____.”
- “Automation poses a threat to global employment: it _____, _____, and _____.”

Would you like to try one of those stems and paste your new thesis here? I’ll give quick, focused feedback and we’ll only continue to Step 2 once you’re happy with it. Keep it short — one confident sentence.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T10:47:44.076Z

**You:** Although automation increases efficiency, it ultimately harms employment because it causes displacement of low skilled workers, and it is ack of retraining.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T10:51:24.237Z

**Assistant:** Nice revision — good job stating your position and giving two clear reasons. A few quick, focused suggestions before you try another draft:

What’s good
- Clear viewpoint: you say automation harms employment.
- You named two specific reasons (displacement of low-skilled workers; lack of retraining), which is exactly what a thesis should preview.

What to fix (brief)
- Spelling/typo: “ack” → “a lack.”
- Word form and parallelism: make the two reasons match grammatically (both -ing phrases or both noun phrases). Right now one is “displacement of low skilled workers” and the other is “a lack of retraining” — make them parallel.
- Hyphenation: use “low-skilled” (adjective + noun).
- Remove unnecessary commas: don’t put a comma before “and” when joining two short parallel reasons.
- Tone: “ultimately” is fine, but consider stronger verbs like “undermine” or “harm” if you prefer.

Small helping phrases (use these to build a parallel pair; don’t copy a full sentence from me)
- “displacing low-skilled workers”
- “limiting retraining opportunities”
- “causing widespread job loss”
- “increasing income inequality”

Try this stem (fill the blanks and paste your new thesis):  
“Although automation increases efficiency, it undermines global employment by _____ and _____.”

Would you like to keep two reasons or add a third (for example, “increasing inequality”)? Go ahead and paste your next version of the thesis when you’re ready — I’ll give quick feedback and then we’ll move to the topic sentence for the first body paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T10:51:40.725Z

**You:** Although automation increases efficiency, it undermines global employment by causing widespread job loss and Intensifying the wealth gap.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:01:24.678Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this is a clear improvement. You’ve stated a position and given two concrete reasons, which is exactly what a good thesis should do.

Quick, focused feedback:
- Small edits: lowercase “intensifying” (no capital), and consider adding “long-term” to connect to the essay question about prospects over time.
- Parallelism: keep both reasons in the same grammatical form (both gerunds work well: “causing…” and “widening…” or “displacing…” and “limiting…”).
- Precision: “widening the wealth gap” or “intensifying income inequality” are slightly more academic than “wealth gap.”

Try this stem (fill the blanks with parallel gerunds):
“Although automation increases efficiency, it undermines long-term global employment prospects by _____ and _____.”

Here are some gerund phrases you can choose from or mix:
- displacing low-skilled workers
- causing widespread job loss
- limiting retraining opportunities
- widening the wealth gap
- intensifying income inequality

Would you like to keep two reasons or add a third? Please paste your next version of the thesis using the stem above, and then we’ll move to Step 2 (the topic sentence for the first body paragraph).

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:01:38.954Z

**You:** Although automation increases efficiency, it undermines long-term global employment prospects by causing widespread job loss and widening the wealth gap.


Now, let's move to the topic sentence for the first body paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:04:30.346Z

**Assistant:** Good — your thesis is strong and ready. Now we’ll work on the topic sentence for the first body paragraph.

Quick confirmation
- Paragraph we’re working on: the one that begins “When people first realize the situation on automation technology…” — is that right? (If you prefer a different paragraph, paste its first sentence.)

Feedback on your current topic sentence
- The current sentence (“When people first realize the situation on automation technology, they see how convenience they are.”) has three main problems:
  1. Grammar and clarity: it’s ungrammatical and hard to follow.
  2. Weak focus: it describes people’s initial reaction (convenience) rather than making a claim that supports your thesis.
  3. Poor connection to the thesis: it doesn’t state the reason from your thesis (widespread job loss / wealth gap).

What a strong topic sentence should do here
- State the paragraph’s main idea clearly and directly.
- Link that idea explicitly to the thesis (for example, show how automation causes job loss).
- Be specific about who is affected or how (e.g., low‑skilled workers, routine jobs, certain industries).

Try revising the topic sentence now
- Please rewrite the topic sentence yourself. Use one of these stems to help (fill the blanks; don’t copy a full model sentence from me):

  - “One major way automation undermines employment is by _____.”
  - “Automation has reduced jobs in _____ by _____, especially for _____.”
  - “By replacing _____ tasks, automation has _____, which harms _____.”

Hints on what to include in the paragraph after the topic sentence
- A concrete example or data point (e.g., manufacturing/retail automation).
- Explanation of the mechanism (machines replace routine tasks; employers save costs).
- Who is most affected (low‑skilled workers, older workers).
- A short link back to the thesis (e.g., how job loss contributes to long‑term employment decline or inequality).

Would you like to try one of the stems and paste your revised topic sentence here? I’ll give quick feedback and then we’ll move to revising the paragraph’s supporting sentences.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:04:49.724Z

**You:** One major way automation undermines employment is by replace low skilled workers.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:07:22.393Z

**Assistant:** Nice attempt — good idea and clear focus. Quick feedback on errors and how to fix them, then you can try again.

What to correct
- Grammar: use the gerund or infinitive form after “is by.” So “is by replacing” (not “is by replace”).
- Hyphenation: write “low-skilled” as an adjective.
- Precision: add a bit of detail about which kinds of jobs (e.g., routine or manufacturing/retail) to link this claim to your thesis.

Checklist for your revised topic sentence
- Begins with a clear claim that supports the thesis.
- Uses correct grammar (is by + -ing form).
- Includes “low-skilled” with a hyphen.
- Optionally names a sector or task type (routine jobs, manufacturing, retail) to make it concrete.

Try one of these short stems (pick one and fill the blank, or write your own):

**You:** One major way automation undermines employment is by displacing low-skilled, routine workers.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:08:43.877Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. Quick confirmations before we continue:

1) Confirmed targets for this session
- Revise thesis so it’s clear, strong, and previews the main points.  
- Improve the first body paragraph’s topic sentence and then revise that paragraph’s supporting sentences for clarity and unity.

2) Confirmed thesis I’ll treat as the current version (please say “yes” if you’re happy):
Although automation increases efficiency, it undermines long-term global employment prospects by causing widespread job loss and widening the wealth gap.

Is that the thesis you want to keep? (If you want a tiny change, say what and I’ll help.)

Step 2 — Topic sentence feedback (you wrote)
One major way automation undermines employment is by displacing low-skilled, routine workers.

What’s good
- Clear and direct claim that links to the thesis.
- Uses correct grammar and good hyphenation (“low-skilled”).
- Focused: it identifies who is affected and how.

Optional small improvement (your choice)
- You could add an example (sector) or “long-term” if you want stronger connection to the thesis. That’s optional; your sentence is already strong and usable as is.

Would you like to keep this topic sentence, or try a tiny revision to name a sector (e.g., “manufacturing and retail”)?

Step 3 — Revising the rest of the chosen paragraph
Guiding goals for the supporting sentences
- Explain the mechanism: how automation replaces routine tasks and why employers choose machines.
- Give a concrete example or detail (a sector, a job type, or a short statistic if you know one).
- Explain who is most affected (low-skilled, older workers) and why retraining is hard for them.
- Link back briefly to your thesis (how this displacement contributes to long-term employment decline or inequality).

Try this now (your turn)
Rewrite 2–3 supporting sentences for the paragraph. Keep them short and clear. Use at least one example (sector or job type) and a short explanation of the effect on workers. Here are sentence starters (use them, or write your own):

- “For example, in _____ (manufacturing/retail/administrative), _____ has been replaced by automation because _____.”
- “This replacement harms low-skilled workers because _____.”
- “As a result, these workers _____, which contributes to _____ (long-term job decline/inequality).”

Please paste your new supporting sentences when ready. I’ll give quick feedback and then we’ll update the paragraph.

Because you made a change (the new topic sentence), here is the full essay text with the current thesis and your revised topic sentence included. I haven’t rewritten the supporting sentences yet — I’ll wait for your revision so you can try it first.

Nowadays, automation technelogy are being deveped in the soviety around the whole world. It transformig industries and reducing people's jobs for boosting the efficiency. Someone think that this technological shift enhance global emplyment prospects in long term. Although automation increases efficiency, it undermines long-term global employment prospects by causing widespread job loss and widening the wealth gap.

One major way automation undermines employment is by displacing low-skilled, routine workers. The technologies let people get free from work and also boosting the efficiency of work. They prababebly believe it is a good situation without any cons. But the truth——and also the biggest problem is that automation reduce many of jobs that make lots of poople can not get any saliry to support their family. People who didn't get high level education may lose the chance to work in the society, which means they lose the chance to take care of themselves and their family——They may not do well than automation, so how they can get money ? No way.

Next step: paste 2–3 revised supporting sentences for the paragraph when you’re ready. I’ll give focused feedback and then we’ll produce the updated full paragraph. Good progress — you’re doing well at focusing the argument.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:09:06.135Z

**You:** For example, in manufacturing,  worker has been replaced by automation because the production speed of machines is to some extent greater than that of manual labor. This replacement harms low-skilled workers, they are facing the problem of unemployment. And due to the limited opportunities for retraining, low skilled workers being replaced by automation will lead to widespread unemployment in society. Therefore, automation technology may have a negative impact on the employment structure of society.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:18:52.044Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — you’ve moved this paragraph forward by adding concrete support. I’ll give quick, focused feedback on those sentences and then ask you to try a revision.

First, here is the full essay with your current thesis, topic sentence, and the supporting sentences you just wrote (I included your text exactly so we can revise together):

Nowadays, automation technelogy are being deveped in the soviety around the whole world. It transformig industries and reducing people's jobs for boosting the efficiency. Someone think that this technological shift enhance global emplyment prospects in long term. Although automation increases efficiency, it undermines long-term global employment prospects by causing widespread job loss and widening the wealth gap.

One major way automation undermines employment is by displacing low-skilled, routine workers. For example, in manufacturing,  worker has been replaced by automation because the production speed of machines is to some extent greater than that of manual labor. This replacement harms low-skilled workers, they are facing the problem of unemployment. And due to the limited opportunities for retraining, low skilled workers being replaced by automation will lead to widespread unemployment in society. Therefore, automation technology may have a negative impact on the employment structure of society.

Feedback on the supporting sentences (short and specific)
- Sentence 1 (example): Grammar and article problems: “worker has been replaced” → needs plural or article (“many workers” or “a worker”); awkward phrase “to some extent greater than” → simplify to “greater than.” Try to be specific (e.g., “production-line workers” or “assembly-line jobs”).
- Sentence 2 (harm): It’s a comma splice and vague. Instead of linking two independent clauses with a comma, separate them or use a conjunction. Also add a brief explanation of why unemployment follows (employers prefer machines, few alternative jobs).
- Sentence 3 (retraining): Tense and form issues: “low skilled workers being replaced” is awkward. Use a clearer structure: “Because retraining opportunities are limited, displaced low-skilled workers face long-term unemployment.” Also add who faces barriers (older workers, low education).
- Sentence 4 (conclusion): Repeats the point (“negative impact on employment structure”) — that’s okay as a closing, but tighten it and explicitly link to your thesis (job loss + inequality).

Grammar/word-choice hints you can apply
- Use plural when you mean more than one: “workers,” not “worker.”
- Use articles: “in manufacturing, many workers have been replaced…”
- Avoid comma splices: separate clauses with a period or use a conjunction (and, so, which).
- Use hyphen: “low-skilled workers.”
- Prefer simpler, clearer phrases: “because machines are faster and cheaper than human labor” instead of “to some extent greater.”

Try revising now (your turn)
Please rewrite 2–3 supporting sentences. Use these short stems to help (fill the blanks; don’t copy a full model sentence from me):

- “For example, in _____ (manufacturing/retail/administration), many low-skilled workers have been replaced by automation because _____. ”
- “This change harms low-skilled workers because _____. ”
- “Because retraining opportunities are limited, displaced workers _____. ”
- “As a result, _____, which supports the claim that automation undermines long-term employment.”

Would you like to try 2 sentences (example + harm) or 3 (example + harm + retraining/result)? Paste your revision and I’ll give quick feedback and then we’ll finalize the paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:19:16.178Z

**You:** One major way automation undermines employment is by displacing low-skilled, routine workers. For example, in manufacturing, many workers has been replaced by automation because the production speed of machines is greater than that of manual labor(e.g.assembly-line jobs). This replacement harms low-skilled workers, especially older workers, low education workers, they are facing the problem of unemployment. And due to employers prefer machines, the opportunities of retraining will be reduced. So low-skilled workers being replaced by automation will lead to widespread unemployment in society. Therefore, automation technology may have a negative impact on the employment structure of society.

**Assistant:** Great work — you’ve made solid progress by adding concrete examples and attempting fuller explanations. Let’s tidy this paragraph so it’s clearer, grammatically correct, and tightly linked to your thesis.

First, here is the full essay with your latest paragraph included (I haven’t changed your sentences — this is your version so you can revise it next):

Focused feedback on the paragraph (short, practical):
- Subject–verb agreement: “many workers has been replaced” → should be “many workers have been replaced” or “many workers were replaced.”
- Articles and plurals: use “assembly-line jobs” (plural) and add space after parentheses; “low-skilled” needs a hyphen; “low education workers” → “workers with low levels of education” or “less-educated workers.”
- Comma splices and sentence boundaries: “This replacement harms low-skilled workers, especially older workers, low education workers, they are facing the problem of unemployment.” is a run-on; separate ideas into clear short sentences.
- Cause vs. effect clarity: “And due to employers prefer machines, the opportunities of retraining will be reduced.” — this is unclear and ungrammatical. If you mean employers have less incentive to retrain, say that; if you mean training programs are limited, say that.
- Word choice and concision: replace “So low-skilled workers being replaced by automation will lead to widespread unemployment in society.” with a clearer causal sentence and link it back to your thesis (long-term effects).
- Repetition: tighten the ending — you don’t need both “widespread unemployment” and “negative impact on the employment structure” if they say the same thing; pick one clear claim and connect it to the thesis.

Try revising 2–3 sentences now
Pick which of these to rewrite (or do all three):
1) The example sentence about manufacturing (fix article/verb and add clarity).  
2) The sentence explaining who is harmed (split into 1–2 short sentences; fix hyphenation).  
3) The sentence about retraining and the concluding result (clarify cause and link to thesis).

Use one of these stems to guide your rewrite (fill the blanks with your words):
- “For example, in manufacturing, many workers have been replaced by automation because _____.”  
- “This change harms low-skilled workers, especially _____, because _____.”  
- “Because retraining opportunities are limited (or because employers have little incentive to retrain), displaced workers _____, which _____ (contributes to long-term unemployment/widens inequality).”

Would you like to try rewriting sentences 1–3 using those stems? Paste your revised sentences and I’ll give quick, focused edits. When you’re ready, I’ll paste the full essay again with your new sentences included. Keep your sentences short and direct — you’re very close.

I think it is enough for this paragraph. Due to not completing the second and final paragraphs during the exam, I will rewrite them myself.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:34:00.078Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — you focused the thesis and developed a clear, supported paragraph. I made only targeted corrections to your chosen thesis and the first body paragraph (kept your ideas and wording but fixed grammar, punctuation, and clarity). Below is a very short summary of the main edits and then the full essay text with those changes.

What I corrected (brief)
- Thesis: kept your improved content and tightened wording to be confident and parallel.
- Topic sentence: kept your sentence because it was already strong.
- Supporting sentences: fixed subject–verb agreement, hyphenation (low‑skilled), comma splices/run‑ons, article use, and clarified the retraining reason; kept your examples and meaning.
- I did not change the rest of the essay (you said you will rewrite the remaining paragraphs).

Someone think that this technological shift enhance global emplyment prospects in long term. Although automation increases efficiency, it undermines long-term global employment prospects by causing widespread job loss and widening the wealth gap.

One major way automation undermines employment is by displacing low-skilled, routine workers. For example, in manufacturing, many workers have been replaced by automation because machines are faster and cheaper than manual labor, particularly in assembly-line jobs. This change harms low-skilled workers, especially older workers and those with low levels of education, who often face unemployment. Because employers have less incentive to retrain staff and because training opportunities are limited, displaced workers frequently struggle to find new jobs. As a result, automation can lead to widespread unemployment and contributes to a long-term restructuring of the labor market.

Would you like any of these next steps?
- I can quickly proofread and correct the rest of your essay (spelling, grammar, and clearer phrasing) if you paste the rest.
- Or I can help you plan the second and third body paragraphs and the conclusion (quick outlines and topic sentences).
- Or I can give a short checklist for final polishing before you submit.

Which would you prefer?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:34:26.218Z

**You:** I prefer you help me plan the second and third body paragraphs and the conclusion (quick outlines and topic sentences).

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:36:07.210Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’ll give quick, usable plans (very short topic-sentence options + 3–4 bullet points each) for the second and third body paragraphs and for the conclusion. I’ll keep these as suggestions you can adapt; I won’t write full paragraphs for you. After you pick options, you can try drafting and I’ll give focused feedback.

Paragraph 2 — focus: inequality / wealth gap
Topic-sentence options (pick or adapt):
- Option A: “Automation exacerbates income inequality by creating high-paying roles for skilled workers while eliminating many low‑paid jobs.”  
- Option B: “Because automation rewards technical skills and capital investment, it increases earnings at the top while suppressing wages for routine work.”

Support (choose 2–3 of these in the paragraph):
- Example/evidence: mention industries (e.g., tech, finance, automated warehouses, cashier automation in retail) or a brief general stat (if you can add one later).
- Mechanism: explain how firms pay more for scarce technical skills and buy machines that replace routine tasks, raising returns to capital.
- Who loses vs who gains: contrast high‑skilled professionals and owners of capital with low‑skilled workers.
- Link to thesis: say how this growing gap undermines long‑term employment prospects by concentrating wealth and reducing consumer demand for labor‑intensive sectors.

Useful words/phrases to use: skill-biased technological change, wage premium, income inequality, returns to capital, polarized labor market.
Transition from paragraph 1: “Moreover,” or “In addition,”

Paragraph 3 — focus: retraining / structural unemployment & policy
Topic-sentence options:
- Option A: “Limited retraining opportunities and skill mismatches mean many displaced workers cannot transition into new jobs, producing persistent structural unemployment.”  
- Option B: “Without effective education and policy responses, the pace of automation can outstrip the workforce’s ability to adapt.”

Support (pick 2–3):
- Explain barriers: cost, age, education level, geographic immobility, time needed to retrain.
- Example: older factory workers, workers in regions dependent on manufacturing — explain practical obstacles (family responsibilities, lack of training programs).
- Policy angle: briefly note that government/employer investment in reskilling is necessary but often insufficient or slow.
- Link to thesis: show how these barriers make job losses long‑term, not quickly temporary.

Useful words/phrases: reskilling, structural unemployment, labor‑market frictions, workforce transition, training programs.
Transition from previous paragraph: “Finally,” or “Another key problem is that”

Conclusion — structure + topic-sentence options
Structure (3 short parts):
1) Restate thesis in different words (1 sentence).  
2) Summarize the three main reasons (1–2 short sentences).  
3) Final thought: implication or brief policy recommendation (1 sentence).

Concluding-sentence options (pick one to close):
- Option A (implication): “Therefore, while automation brings efficiency, its tendency to displace routine workers, widen inequality, and outpace retraining threatens long‑term employment unless policymakers and employers act.”  
- Option B (policy focus): “To preserve long‑term employment prospects, governments and firms must invest in retraining, social protections, and policies that share the gains of automation more widely.”

Linking language to use in the conclusion: “In sum,” “Overall,” “For these reasons,” “Consequently,”

Next step (your choice)
- Which topic-sentence option do you prefer for paragraph 2 and paragraph 3?  
- Would you like to try writing paragraph 2 now (2–4 short sentences) and get feedback?  

You’re doing well organizing the argument — pick a topic sentence for paragraph 2 and I’ll help you shape the first draft.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:36:30.884Z

**You:** paragraph 2：Automation exacerbates income inequality by creating high-paying roles for skilled workers while eliminating many low‑paid jobs. Enterprises can achieve a surge in output and profits by investing heavily in AI and robots without increasing or even significantly reducing their workforce (especially in the technology finance industry). This widening gap has allowed companies to taste the sweetness of automation technology and increase their return on capital. On the contrary, among the population replaced by machines, the majority of people are unemployed or have low paying jobs, which is in stark contrast to the large profits gained by enterprises. That's why automation can exacerbate the wealth gap.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:45:01.689Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this paragraph has a clear focus and a logical connection to your thesis. Before I edit anything, let’s agree what to do next so we stay on track.

Quick diagnostic (short)
- Content & Ideas: Developing → You have a clear claim (automation increases inequality) and relevant reasons, but some ideas repeat and could be more specific.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Developing → The paragraph generally moves logically, but transitions between sentences are rough and the contrast sentences are repetitive.
- Vocabulary: Basic → A few informal or awkward phrases (“taste the sweetness”) and some word-choice issues (“technology finance industry”).
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Basic → Problems with articles, plural/verb agreement, and some awkward phrasing.

Suggested revision priorities (pick up to two)
- Strengthen the topic sentence (make it more formal/precise)
- Improve sentence clarity and logical flow (reduce repetition, clarify cause → effect)
- Fix grammar and vocabulary (make wording more academic)

Which would you like to focus on? (Pick 1–2)
- I can revise only the topic sentence and give guidance for the rest, or
- I can guide you to rewrite the paragraph yourself (you try; I give feedback), or
- If you prefer, I can produce a corrected version — but only after you confirm you want me to do that.

A few targeted, actionable suggestions you can apply now
- Make the topic sentence slightly more formal and precise (replace “low‑paid jobs” with “lower‑paid jobs” or “low‑wage jobs”).
- Replace informal metaphors (“taste the sweetness”) with academic phrasing: “realize significant profit gains” or “increase returns to capital.”
- Fix sector phrase: “technology and finance sectors” or “technology and finance industries.”
- Streamline the causal explanation: say firms invest in automation because it raises productivity and lowers labor costs; then explain how that benefits owners/ skilled workers but harms low‑wage workers.
- Tighten the contrast sentences: avoid repeating “on the contrary” + “that's why.” Instead, show the contrast in one clear sentence and conclude with how this connects to the thesis.

Helpful stems to try (pick one and rewrite 1–2 sentences)
- Topic sentence: “Automation exacerbates income inequality by creating high‑paying roles for skilled workers while eliminating many low‑wage jobs.”
- Example sentence: “For example, firms in the technology and finance sectors can increase output and profits by investing in AI and robots without hiring additional workers.”
- Contrast/result sentence: “As a result, owners and highly skilled employees gain large returns to capital, while displaced workers face unemployment or lower‑paid jobs, widening the wealth gap.”

What would you like to do now?
- Try revising the paragraph yourself using those stems (paste your revision) — I’ll give focused feedback; or
- Confirm you want me to produce a corrected version of this paragraph (I’ll then include the full essay text with that change).

Which option do you prefer?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:45:18.312Z

**You:** Automation exacerbates income inequality by creating high‑paying roles for skilled workers while eliminating many low‑wage jobs. For example, firms in the technology and finance sectors can increase output and profits by investing in AI and robots without hiring additional workers. This widening gap has enabled companies to increase their return on capital. On the contrary, among the population replaced by machines, the majority of people are unemployed or have lower-paid jobs, which is in stark contrast to the large profits gained by enterprises.As a result, owners and highly skilled employees gain large returns to capital, while displaced workers face unemployment or lower‑paid jobs, widening the wealth gap.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:50:56.947Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this paragraph has a clear focus and a strong connection to your thesis. I’ll give short, targeted feedback and a few useful stems so you can revise it yourself (recommended). If you prefer, I can make the corrections after you confirm.

Brief strengths
- Clear topic: you focus on how automation increases inequality.
- Good choice of example (technology and finance sectors).
- Strong final idea: contrast between winners (owners/skilled workers) and losers (displaced workers).

Main problems to fix (prioritized)
1) Repetition and weak transitions — you repeat the same idea several times (“major profits,” “large returns,” “As a result…”) so tighten the paragraph and make a clear cause → effect flow.  
2) Grammar, punctuation, and spacing — fix missing spaces after periods, run-on sentences, and awkward phrases (“This widening gap has enabled companies to increase their return on capital.” sounds backwards).  
3) Tone and formality — replace informal phrases and connectors (“On the contrary,” awkward commas) with precise academic phrasing and smoother transitions.

Concrete, short suggestions you can apply now
- Remove “On the contrary,” and the duplicated result sentence. Use one clear concluding sentence that shows the result of the changes you described.  
- Make the causal chain explicit: firms invest in automation → output/profits rise and need fewer workers → owners/ skilled workers gain more → displaced low‑wage workers lose jobs or face lower wages.  
- Fix small grammar/punctuation issues: add spaces after periods, remove extra commas, and use “low‑wage” or “low‑paid” consistently.

Stems and short model phrases to help you rewrite (use these or adapt)
- Topic sentence (you already have a good one; keep or use): “Automation exacerbates income inequality by creating high‑paying roles for skilled workers while eliminating many low‑wage jobs.”  
- Example sentence stem: “For example, firms in the technology and finance sectors have increased output and profits by investing in AI and robots, reducing demand for human labor in _____ (e.g., customer service, trading, or back‑office functions).”  
- Result/concluding sentence stem: “Consequently, owners and highly skilled employees reap larger returns to capital, while displaced workers face unemployment or lower‑paid jobs, widening the wealth gap.”

Quick edit hints (apply directly)
- Replace “the majority of people are unemployed or have lower-paid jobs, which is in stark contrast…” with something tighter like: “many displaced workers become unemployed or accept lower‑paid work, while firms and skilled employees gain higher returns.”  
- Remove duplicated closing sentences — one strong concluding sentence is enough.

What would you like to do next?
- Option A (recommended): Try rewriting this paragraph now using one of the stems above (paste your revision) — I’ll give focused edits.  
- Option B: Tell me to revise it for you; if you choose this, I’ll return the corrected paragraph and then include the full essay text with that change.

Which option do you prefer?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:51:26.739Z

**You:** Option B

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:52:54.146Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — great choice to ask for help. Quick note about scope so we stay on track:

Right now we’ve already revised the thesis and the first body paragraph together (those edits are in the last full essay I sent). You’ve asked Option B (have me revise paragraph 2). That’s fine, but we need to confirm a small change in our agreed targets: do you want me to

A) Switch the one body-paragraph I revise from paragraph 1 to paragraph 2 (so I will now revise paragraph 2 and leave paragraph 1 as we last revised it), or  
B) Keep the original plan (thesis + paragraph 1 revised by me) and instead I guide you step-by-step to rewrite paragraph 2 yourself?

Please pick A or B. If you pick A, I’ll revise paragraph 2 now and then paste the full essay with that change included. If you pick B, I’ll give quick, focused feedback and sentence-level guidance so you can rewrite paragraph 2 yourself.

Which do you want?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:53:08.320Z

**You:** I pick A

*Time:* 2025-12-06T11:58:18.508Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I’ll revise paragraph 2 now (as you chose A). I’ve kept the thesis and the first body paragraph as we last revised them and replaced the placeholder with a corrected paragraph 2 that focuses on inequality and links to your thesis.

Here is the full essay with paragraph 2 revised:

---
Nowadays, automation technelogy are being deveped in the soviety around the whole world. It transformig industries and reducing people's jobs for boosting the efficiency. Someone think that this technological shift enhance global emplyment prospects in long term. Although automation increases efficiency, it undermines long-term global employment prospects by causing widespread job loss and widening the wealth gap.

One major way automation undermines employment is by displacing low-skilled, routine workers. For example, in manufacturing, many workers have been replaced by automation because machines are faster and cheaper than manual labor, particularly in assembly-line jobs. This change harms low-skilled workers, especially older workers and those with low levels of education, who often face unemployment. Because employers have less incentive to retrain staff and because training opportunities are limited, displaced workers frequently struggle to find new jobs. As a result, automation can lead to widespread unemployment and contributes to a long-term restructuring of the labor market.

Automation also exacerbates income inequality by creating high-paying roles for skilled workers while eliminating many low-wage jobs. For example, firms in the technology and finance sectors have increased output and profits by investing in AI and automated systems, reducing demand for human labor in routine tasks such as customer service, data entry, and basic trading. Because firms can substitute capital for routine labor, owners and highly skilled employees receive larger returns, while low-wage workers lose bargaining power and job opportunities. Consequently, many displaced workers become unemployed or accept lower-paid positions, widening the wealth gap and weakening overall demand for labor‑intensive goods and services, which further undermines long‑term employment prospects.

Would you like one of these next steps?
- I can proofread and correct the remaining introduction (fix spelling, grammar) and the “In the other hand,” fragment so the paragraph flow is clean.
