            ## Contribution Analysis

            Here is a polished, natural-sounding revision of the last paragraph for Task 2, focusing on clear grammar and a strong academic tone:

**Revised Last Paragraph:**  
In conclusion, the exploitation of migrant workers through long working hours and unfair pay has serious negative effects on their families and society as a whole. It is therefore essential for governments to enact and enforce stricter labor laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights and ensure fair treatment for all.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 – The original essays address the main themes (unemployment rates and migrant worker exploitation). Core ideas are present and mostly relevant, with some attempt to discuss causes and effects. However, there is limited depth of analysis, lack of nuanced viewpoint, and some generalizations (“countries should stay a open mind…”).
- Organization: 17/25 – Both tasks follow an understandable structure (data, explanation, conclusion), but paragraphing is awkward and progression of ideas is sometimes unclear or repetitive (especially in Task 2). Transitions are weak.
- Vocabulary: 17/25 – Vocabulary is generally adequate but repetitive (“outperforming” misused; “gap”/“highest”), with some topic-relevant terms. Occasional awkward or imprecise word choices reduce clarity.
- Grammar: 15/25 – Noticeable grammatical errors, awkward sentence construction, and lapses in subject-verb agreement. Some sentences hinder readability.
- **Original Essay Total: 67/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 – The revised essays reflect clearer main points and improved articulation of key issues (e.g., “large gaps in unemployment rates exist... influenced by national labor laws or policies”). There is a more explicit connection between the underlying causes and the data.
- Organization: 20/25 – Logical paragraph structure improved, with better topic sentences and clearer conclusions. Some minor issues remain with progression and cohesion (“6 out of 4 of the countries…” error persists).
- Vocabulary: 20/25 – Word choice is more precise (e.g., “illustrates,” “disparities,” “employment opportunities”), less repetition, and fewer misused terms. Some awkward phrases remain.
- Grammar: 18/25 – Grammar is notably stronger, with fewer errors and clearer sentence structure but still occasional mistakes (“6 out of 4…” instead of “6 out of 10”). Some run-ons and confusion in complex sentences.
- **Revised Essay Total: 79/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +12 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis statements in both tasks are more precise and academically worded.
  - Body paragraphs demonstrate clearer topic sentences and better transitions.
  - Vocabulary is more accurate; “outperforming” removed where inappropriate, replaced by “higher/lower unemployment rates.”
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Some factual/statistical errors remain (“6 out of 4…”); careful proofreading was needed.
  - Paragraph development and use of evidence could be further deepened (more analysis).
  - Occasional awkward phrasing and grammar (complex ideas should be more fluently expressed).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 16**
- **Conversation Quality:**
  - The conversation shows step-by-step movement through the revision process, with student and AI negotiating targets, revising thesis statements, topic sentences, and body paragraphs. Student asked for guidance, occasionally responded with requests to move to the next step. Interaction focused on surface revision (vocabulary/grammar) rather than deeper structural changes or critical engagement with ideas.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 – The chat involves a reasonable number of exchanges (16) with key revision steps covered. However, student responses are brief and often only progress to the next stage rather than providing detailed rationales or asking reflective questions. Some depth achieved through AI’s prompting and modeling, but minimal multi-level questions from the student.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 – While the student occasionally requests more guidance or help, they generally accept the AI’s recommendations without substantial questioning or justification. Very little evidence of rejecting or critically evaluating AI suggestions.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 – The student moves through required revision stages (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph, for both tasks) in order, but there is limited iteration and minimal independent re-writing. Revision cycles are mostly one-step, with little recursive review.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Willingness to follow revision steps across both tasks (evidence: explicit requests to move to next stage).
- Openness to AI feedback and modeling; student solicits guidance and incorporates suggested vocabulary/structures.
- Basic understanding of essay structure and thematic requirements for both tasks.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Engage more critically with AI suggestions (ask more “why” and “how” questions; provide reasoning for choices).
- Proofread for statistical accuracy and logic (“6 out of 4 of the countries…”).
- Deepen analysis in body paragraphs (use examples, explain causes/effects beyond surface-level).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good – Student states when ready to move to next task, indicates which area to work on, but gives minimal detail about essay goals.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement – Revision steps are largely directed by AI; student does not set independent strategic priorities or reflect on improvement.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement – Very few instances of student challenging or questioning AI feedback.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement – Most revisions are AI-modeled or prompted; student rarely initiates edits without direct prompting.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing Skills:** Proofread carefully for factual and statistical accuracy; clarify and deepen analysis in body paragraphs.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills:** Practice questioning AI suggestions and providing justification for revisions; strive for more self-directed revision decisions.
3. **Overall Improvement:** Take ownership of the editing process by independently applying learned writing strategies, and strive to connect all revision steps to your argument’s logic rather than simply addressing surface-level concerns.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
The student successfully completed basic revision steps for both essay tasks and demonstrated incremental improvement in vocabulary, structure, and grammar. However, there was minimal critical engagement or independent editing, and some errors persisted through revision. Further support may be needed to build confidence with strategic revision and deeper analytic writing. Consider exercises where the student must reject or adjust AI feedback to foster critical reasoning.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Task 1:
The chart shows the unemployment rate gap between migrants and local population in 10 selected countries in 2022.

In the chart, showing that Sweden’s local population outperforming migrants is the highest among all the countries and Croatia has the highest rate of unemployment migrants outperforming native-born population. Among the 10 countries, Sapin gets the highest unemployment rate (12%) and South Korea gets the lowest rate (2.4%). 6 over 4 of the countries’ local population is outperforming migrants.

For comparison, the difference of highest and lowest unemployment rate is 10%. The unemployment rate gap between Sweden and Croatia, which is around +10, shows a big difference.

To sum up, there are a big unemployment rate gap in different countries, it is because of the countries’ law, to have a equal employment chance for both local and migrants population, countries should stay a open mind towards the benefit offering to both sides.


Task 2:
Nowadays, migrant workers face exploitation due to weak regulations, enduring long hours and unfair pay. In my opinion, government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights.

In fact, the lack of regulations of protecting migrant workers disadvantage both countries and workers. For workers, the unfair payment will make them suffer in maintaining basic survival needs, such as they may become starving or unable to pay for their rent. And most of them may need to use money to support their family in other countries, with long hours of working, they may become weak and need to pay for medicine, which takes a lot of money and their family may become poor. Moving on to the perspective of government, this kind of worker appearing will make their reputation become worse, so the country of the migrant worker may not be able to have good cooperate because they treat them so bad.

For minimizing this kind of unfair situation, government can set stricter law to protect the migrant workers. For example, government can enforce the minimal pay of workers, which can both protect local and migrant worker to have the money to fufill their basic needs. Besides, government can set up a team to investigate the company, confirming that they have reasonable working hours and payment, if the company do so, then punish them.

To conclude, as long hours and unfair pay of migrant workers affect a lot on families and countries. As a responsible government, they should enforce stricter laws to safeguard the rights of migrant workers.


Revised:
Task 1:
The chart illustrates unemployment rates between migrants and local populations in ten countries, demonstrating the problem of unemployment.

The chart presents data on the ten countries, Sweden displays the widest gap in unemployment rates between its local and migrant populations, while Croatia has the highest rate of unemployment, with migrants having a lower unemployment rate than the native-born population. Among the 10 countries, Spain has the highest unemployment rate (12%), while South Korea has the lowest rate (2.4%). 6 out of 4 of the countries’ local population is outperforming migrants.

For comparison, the difference between the highest and lowest unemployment rates is 10%. The difference in unemployment rates between Sweden and Croatia, which is around +10, shows a big difference.

To conclude, large gaps in unemployment rates exist between migrants and locals in different countries. These disparities can be influenced by national labor laws or policies. Therefore, to have equal employment opportunities, countries should adopt open-minded policies that offer benefits to both groups.


Task 2:
Nowadays, migrant workers face exploitation due to weak regulations, enduring long hours, and unfair pay. In my opinion, the government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights.

In fact, the lack of regulations to protect migrant workers disadvantages both countries and workers. For workers, the unfair payment forces migrant workers to live in poverty, putting their health and stability at risk. Therefore, government action is necessary to protect their rights in maintaining basic survival needs, such as they may become starving or unable to pay for their rent. And most of them may need to use money to support their family in other countries. With long hours of working, they may become weak and need to pay for medicine, which takes a lot of money, and their family may become poor. Moving on to the perspective of the government, this kind of worker appearing will make their reputation become worse, so the country of the migrant worker may not be able to have good cooperation because they treat them so badly.

To minimize this kind of unfair situation, the government can set stricter laws to protect the migrant workers. For example, the government can enforce the minimum pay of workers, which can protect both local and migrant workers to have the money to fulfill their basic needs. Besides, the government can set up a team to investigate the company, confirming that they have reasonable working hours and payment. If the company does so, then punish them.

In conclusion, long working hours and unfair pay for migrant workers have serious negative impacts on their families and on society as a whole. Therefore, it is essential for governments to enforce stricter laws to protect the rights of migrant workers and ensure fair treatment for all.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-14T13:18:54.643Z

**You:** There are 2 tasks, please first help me focus on the first task, task 1. Help me revise the thesis statement.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T13:24:12.050Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let’s begin with our preliminary stage before we dive into revising your thesis statement for Task 1. 😊

---

**Preliminary Stage: Negotiating Targets and Diagnosing the Essay**

**1. Negotiate Targets**

To make your revision as effective as possible, could you tell me:
- What do you feel needs the most improvement in Task 1? (For example: clarity, structure, vocabulary, grammar, or overall style?)
- Is there a particular learning target you want to focus on today for Task 1?

**2. Diagnostic Feedback (Quick Essay Review)**

I’ll review Task 1 using the rubric:

- **Content and Ideas:**  
Your main ideas are connected to the topic and show some awareness of the issue, but the viewpoint and purpose could be more clearly stated. The summary and conclusion are a bit unclear.

- **Organisation and Logical Progression:**  
There is some structure, but sentences and ideas are not always well-organized or logically connected. The opening, development, and conclusion need clearer progression.

- **Vocabulary:**  
Vocabulary is generally basic; some repetition and minor errors (e.g., "outperforming" used for unemployment rates is confusing). A few topic-specific terms are used, but more precision would help.

- **Grammar and Sentence Structure:**  
There are grammatical errors and awkward sentences that affect clarity. Some sentences are incomplete or confusing.

**Strengths:**  
Relevant data mentioned; attempt to compare and discuss differences.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- Clearer thesis statement (purpose and viewpoint)
- More precise vocabulary and improved grammar
- Better structure and flow (especially the introduction and reasoning)

**3. Student Priority Selection**

Based on this feedback, which area would you like to focus on for Task 1 in this revision session?
- Thesis clarity and structure?
- Vocabulary accuracy?
- Grammar and sentence improvement?
- Logical organization?

## **Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision (Task 1)**

**Current thesis statement:**
> "The chart shows the unemployment rate gap between migrants and the local population in 10 selected countries in 2022."

**Feedback:**
- *Strengths:* Direct and simple.
- *Areas to improve (Vocabulary):* “Unemployment rate gap” is not very precise—consider “difference in unemployment rates,” and clarify the significance (why is it important?).
- *Other suggestions:* Make sure the thesis previews the main idea or structure.

**Guiding Question:**  
Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now to make it more precise and clear? For example, you could:
- Use the term “difference in unemployment rates” instead of “gap.”
- Add a phrase explaining what the main finding or point is.

**Model Revision (for reference—not for direct copying!):**  
"The chart compares unemployment rates between migrants and the local population across ten countries in 2022, revealing significant differences in employment challenges faced by each group."

**Your turn!**  
Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement using more precise vocabulary?  
If you’d like a bit more guidance, I can help you brainstorm words or phrases first.

---

Whenever you’re ready, please share your revised thesis statement. I’ll give feedback and suggestions on vocabulary until you feel satisfied!

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:17:37.890Z

**You:** i want more guidence

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:24:02.992Z

**Assistant:** Of course—happy to give you more guidance! 😊

Let’s break down your thesis statement step by step.

### 1. **Key Elements to Include**
- **What does the chart show?**  
  It compares **unemployment rates** of **migrants** and **local populations** in ten countries.

- **What is the main point or significance?**  
  There are **notable differences**—in some countries, migrants have higher unemployment; in others, locals do.

### 2. **Useful Vocabulary**
Let's pick some more precise academic phrases:

- **Instead of “gap”:**  
   - *difference in unemployment rates*  
   - *variation in unemployment rates*  
   - *disparity between migrant and local unemployment rates*
- **Instead of “shows”:**  
   - *illustrates*  
   - *compares*  
   - *presents data on*
- **Instead of “outperforming” (not suitable for unemployment):**  
   - *reported higher unemployment rates*  
   - *had lower unemployment rates*  
- **For significance:**  
   - *highlights employment challenges*  
   - *demonstrates uneven job opportunities*  
   - *reveals patterns in job market access*

### 3. **Sample Structures You Can Re-use**
**A. Simple/Direct:**  
> The chart presents the differences in unemployment rates between migrants and local populations in ten countries in 2022.

**B. Nuanced/Analytical:**  
> The chart compares unemployment rates for migrants and native-born populations in ten countries in 2022, highlighting significant disparities that may reflect employment challenges or policy differences.

**C. Focused on Findings:**  
> The chart illustrates how unemployment rates vary between migrants and local populations across ten countries, revealing that some countries have a much wider gap than others.

---

### 4. **Let’s Build Your Thesis Together**

**Prompt:**
- What do you want your main message to be? (For example: ‘There are big differences in unemployment rates between migrants and locals in different countries, and this could be caused by policy differences.’)

**If you like, you can fill in this sentence starter:**
> The chart _________ unemployment rates between migrants and local populations in ten countries, _____________.

- [compares / shows / illustrates / presents …]
- [revealing / highlighting / demonstrating …]

---

#### **Would you like to try filling in the sentence above?**
Or, you can try rearranging one of the sample thesis statements using your own words. If you need more brainstormed vocabulary, just ask!

Let’s take it step by step.  
**What would you like your thesis to say?**  
Would you like to focus on the idea of “differences,” “challenges,” or “causes”?

Once you decide, we’ll make sure the vocabulary is precise and academic.  
Go ahead and give it a try—or let me know if you want even more examples!

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:24:12.925Z

**You:** lets move on to enchance my topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:30:56.801Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s move on to **Step 2—Topic Sentence Revision** for Task 1. Since your main revision target is **precise vocabulary**, we’ll focus on making your topic sentence clear, academically appropriate, and well connected to your (improved) thesis idea.

---

## Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision

**Instructions:**
- Please choose *one* body paragraph from Task 1 that you’d like to improve.  
(You can copy-paste it here, or just tell me which paragraph you want to work on.)

### Let’s quickly review the topic sentences from your current draft:

**Paragraph 2, Original:**  
> The chart presents data on Sweden’s local population outperforms migrants is the highest among all the countries, and Croatia has the highest rate of unemployment, with migrants outperforming the native-born population. Among the 10 countries, Spain has the highest unemployment rate (12%), while South Korea has the lowest rate (2.4%). 6 out of 4 of the countries’ local population is outperforming migrants.

**Feedback & Opportunities for Vocabulary Improvement:**
- “Outperforms” is not accurate in the context of unemployment—let’s use “has a lower unemployment rate” or “reports lower unemployment.”
- Topic sentence should preview the paragraph’s main idea using precise, academic language.

---

### **Guiding Questions**

- What is the *main idea* of this paragraph?  
Is it about which countries have the biggest differences in unemployment rates between migrants and locals?

#### **Sample Topic Sentence Structures (for reference—don't copy directly):**
- "Certain countries show much wider gaps in unemployment rates between migrants and locals, with Sweden and Croatia offering notable examples."
- "The chart reveals that in Sweden, the difference in unemployment rates between locals and migrants is the largest among all countries, while Croatia demonstrates the opposite pattern."

---

## **Your Turn:**

Would you like to try rewriting your paragraph’s topic sentence for clarity and more precise vocabulary?  
For example, begin with:  
> “Among the ten countries, Sweden displays the widest gap in unemployment rates between its local and migrant populations, while …”

Or, if you prefer, tell me the main point you want to express, and we can build the sentence together!

---

**Prompt:**  
- Try to write your revised topic sentence connecting clearly to the thesis (about differences in unemployment rates between migrants and locals).
- Aim for precise vocabulary: “unemployment rate,” “difference,” “gap,” “population,” “migrant,” “local/native-born.”

---

**Would you like to try a revised version now?**  
I’m here to help—just write your new topic sentence, and I’ll give you feedback so you can make it even more precise!

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:31:02.497Z

**You:** revise body paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:33:47.696Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let's work together to revise your chosen body paragraph for Task 1, focusing on **precise vocabulary** and clear ideas. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

---

## **Step 3 — Revising the Chosen Body Paragraph (Task 1)**

**Your Original Paragraph:**  
> The chart presents data on the ten countries, Sweden displays the widest gap in unemployment rates between its local and migrant populations, while Croatia has the highest rate of unemployment, with migrants outperforming the native-born population. Among the 10 countries, Spain has the highest unemployment rate (12%), while South Korea has the lowest rate (2.4%). 6 out of 4 of the countries’ local population is outperforming migrants.

---

**Guiding questions:**
1. Do your supporting sentences use vocabulary that is clear and accurate? (e.g., “outperforming” is confusing when discussing unemployment)
2. Does each sentence directly support the main idea of the topic sentence (biggest differences in unemployment rates)?
3. Are the details easy to understand and logically presented?

Let’s address key issues:

**Vocabulary improvements:**
- Use “has a higher/lower unemployment rate” instead of “outperforming.”
- Clarify which countries have notable gaps, highest rates, and lowest rates.

---

### **Modeling Revision (for guidance—not to copy!):**
> The chart shows that Sweden has the largest difference in unemployment rates, with migrants experiencing much higher unemployment compared to locals. In contrast, Croatia has the highest unemployment rate among migrants compared to the native-born population. Spain reports the highest overall unemployment rate (12%), while South Korea records the lowest (2.4%). In six out of ten countries, the local population has a lower unemployment rate than migrants.

---

Now, **your turn:**  
Would you like to try rewriting your paragraph using more precise terms?  
- State which countries have the biggest gaps in unemployment rates.
- Use “higher/lower unemployment rate” instead of “outperforming.”
- Clearly present supporting details and statistics.

#### **Here’s a sentence starter to help you:**
> According to the chart, Sweden demonstrates the most significant gap in unemployment rates between migrants and locals. In Croatia, however, the unemployment rate for migrants is higher than that of the native-born population. Spain has the highest total unemployment rate among the ten countries, while South Korea has the lowest. Overall, in six out of ten countries, locals have lower unemployment rates than migrants.

---

**Would you like to try revising the paragraph with your own words?**  
If you share your version, I’ll provide feedback and help you continue refining vocabulary and clarity.

---

**When you’re ready, post your revised paragraph and I’ll review it for further improvement!** 😊

---

#### **Full Current Revision (for reference):**

**Task 1 Revised Draft**

The chart presents the differences in unemployment rates between migrants and local populations in ten countries in 2022.

According to the chart, Sweden demonstrates the most significant gap in unemployment rates between migrants and locals. In Croatia, however, the unemployment rate for migrants is higher than that of the native-born population. Spain has the highest overall unemployment rate among the ten countries (12%), while South Korea has the lowest (2.4%). Overall, in six out of ten countries, locals have lower unemployment rates than migrants.

For comparison, the difference between the highest and lowest unemployment rates is about 10%. The variation between Sweden and Croatia, which is around ten percentage points, highlights significant disparities.

To sum up, large gaps in unemployment rates exist between migrants and locals in different countries. These disparities can be influenced by national labor laws or policies. Therefore, to provide equal employment opportunities, countries should adopt open-minded policies that offer benefits to both groups.

**Please post YOUR revised body paragraph, and I’ll help you strengthen it further!**

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:33:57.562Z

**You:** Ok lets move on to the task 2

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:37:43.394Z

**Assistant:** Great—let’s begin the **Preliminary Stage for Task 2** before we enter the three-step revision process!

---

## **Preliminary Stage: Negotiating Targets and Diagnosing the Essay (Task 2)**

### **1. Negotiate Targets**
First, let’s talk about your personal goals for Task 2:
- What do you feel needs the most improvement in Task 2? _(For example: the strength of your argument, the clarity and structure of your paragraphs, vocabulary variety, or your grammar?)_
- Is there a specific target you want to focus on for this essay?

### **2. Diagnostic Feedback (Rubric Review)**

**Based on your draft, here’s my rubric-based feedback:**

**Content and Ideas:**  
- Your essay presents a clear point of view: that governments should enforce stronger laws to protect migrant workers’ rights.  
- There is some awareness of the issue, with arguments about the disadvantages to both workers and governments.
- Reasoning could be more logically developed and explanations more clearly linked to the main argument.

**Organization and Logical Progression:**  
- The paragraphs follow a recognizable structure: introduction, body, and conclusion.
- Some sentences and ideas are disconnected or repetitive. The logic of supporting details can be improved.

**Vocabulary:**  
- Basic academic and topic-specific words are used ("regulations," "exploitation," "rights"), but there are times when vocabulary could be more precise and less repetitive.
- Some awkward phrases and misuse of terms (e.g., “make their reputation become worse”) appear.

**Grammar and Sentence Structure:**  
- Sentences are mostly correctly constructed, but there are common errors and awkward phrasings (e.g., “this kind of worker appearing will make their reputation become worse” or “the lack of regulations of protecting”).
- Some parts are hard to understand due to grammar or word order.

**Strengths:**  
- Clear statement of opinion (thesis)
- Attempts to provide multi-perspective reasoning (effect on workers and governments)

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- More precise and varied vocabulary
- Clearer, more logically connected explanations
- Improved grammar and natural, academic sentence structure

**Assistant:** Excellent choice! We'll focus on **(C) Improving grammar and natural sentence structure** for Task 2. This target will help your writing sound more fluent, academic, and clear to your reader.

Let’s start with the revision process:

## **Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision (Task 2)**

**Current thesis statement:**  
> Nowadays, migrant workers face exploitation due to weak regulations, enduring long hours, and unfair pay. In my opinion, the government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard its rights.

**Feedback:**  
- The meaning is generally clear, but the phrase "safeguard its rights" should refer to migrant workers (“their rights”).
- Sentence structure can be made smoother and a bit more formal.

**Suggested improvement areas:**  
- Rephrase "Nowadays, migrant workers face exploitation due to weak regulations" for a more academic tone.
- Make the second sentence reference "migrant workers' rights," not just "rights."
- Remove unnecessary words ("In my opinion" can usually be replaced by a confident statement).

**Guiding prompt:**

**You:** how to make my argument stronger with sentence

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:41:39.584Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Making your argument stronger means clearly connecting your **opinion (claim)** to **evidence (facts, examples, explanations)**, and showing **why** your opinion matters. You want your sentences to be confident, logical, and convincing.

Let’s break down some **simple strategies** to strengthen your argumentative sentences:

---

## **1. Use Clear, Confident Topic Sentences**

Begin each body paragraph with a sentence that clearly states your main argument for that part.

**Example:**  
*Weak:*  
“In fact, the lack of regulations of protecting migrant workers disadvantage both countries and workers.”

*Stronger:*  
“The lack of legal protection for migrant workers not only harms individuals, but also negatively affects the country's reputation and stability.”

---

## **2. Explain WHY Your Evidence Matters**

After giving an example or fact, add a sentence explaining the effect or significance.

**Example:**  
“Without fair pay, migrant workers struggle to afford basic necessities, which can lead to health problems and financial hardship. This not only affects the workers themselves, but can also damage the country’s social and economic wellbeing.”

---

## **3. Use Linking Words and Phrases**

To make your ideas flow and show logical connections, use phrases such as:
- As a result,
- Therefore,
- For this reason,
- Consequently,
- Furthermore,
- In addition,

**Example:**  
“Furthermore, enforcing minimum wage laws would ensure that all workers, including migrants, could meet their basic needs. As a result, governments would promote social fairness and reduce poverty among vulnerable populations.”

---

## **4. Address Possible Counterarguments**

Mention opposing ideas and show why your argument is stronger.

**Example:**  
“Some may argue that strict laws increase business costs. However, protecting migrant workers’ rights creates a more stable and productive workforce, which benefits the country as a whole.”

---

## **5. Make Your Opinion Direct and Academic**

Use confident language:  
- should  
- must  
- is essential  
- is necessary  
- it is clear that...

**Example:**  
“To ensure true equality, it is essential for governments to enforce strict regulations that protect migrant workers from exploitation.”

---

## **Putting It Together: Model Sentences**

Here’s how you might combine these ideas in a body paragraph:

> The lack of strict labor laws often leads to migrant workers suffering poor working conditions and unfair pay. For example, many migrants are forced to work long hours for low wages, making it difficult for them to meet their daily needs. As a result, their health and well-being are at risk. Therefore, governments must introduce and enforce stronger regulations to guarantee fair treatment and protect these vulnerable workers.

**Summary Table:**

| Weak Sentence | How to Make It Stronger |
|-----|-----------------------------|
| “Unfair payment will make migrants suffer.” | “Unfair payment forces migrant workers to live in poverty, putting their health and stability at risk. Therefore, government action is necessary to protect their rights.” |
| “Government should change the law.” | “Governments must establish and enforce stricter labor laws to protect migrant workers from exploitation and guarantee equal treatment.” |
| “Many workers are hungry.” | “Without fair wages, many migrant workers struggle to afford food and accommodation, which undermines both their well-being and the country’s social stability.” |

**You:** help me revise the last paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:45:11.496Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let’s work together to revise the **last paragraph (the conclusion) of Task 2**, focusing on **grammar, natural sentence structure, and a confident, academic tone**.

---

**Original Last Paragraph:**
> To conclude, as long hours and unfair pay of migrant workers have a lot on families and countries. As a responsible government, they should enforce stricter laws to safeguard the rights of migrant workers.

---

### Step-by-Step Guidance

1. **Restate the main point clearly**  
   - Begin with a summary of the key issue: the negative impacts of exploitation (long hours, unfair pay) on both migrant workers’ families and society.

2. **Use natural, academic phrasing**  
   - Avoid awkward structures like “have a lot on families and countries.”  
   - Try: “negatively affect families and countries” or “have serious consequences for families and society.”

3. **Connect to your argument confidently**
   - State what governments *should* do, using academic and confident language.

---

### Sentence Starters

- *In conclusion*, the exploitation of migrant workers through long hours and unfair pay causes serious harm to families and society.
- To address these problems, it is essential for governments to enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights.
