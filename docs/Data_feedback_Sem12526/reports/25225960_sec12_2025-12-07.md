            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your essay and revision plan! Since you have completed revising the thesis statement, one topic sentence, and one body paragraph, here are a few suggestions and next-step options to further strengthen your essay:

1. **Adding Specific Evidence:**  
Including concrete data, statistics, or specific examples (e.g., citing a country’s labor law or a study about migrant worker conditions) will make your argument more credible and persuasive. Consider researching one or two precise facts to support your points about long hours or low pay.

2. **Enhancing Cohesion and Formality:**  
- Use stronger linking phrases to clarify connections between ideas (e.g., “Moreover,” “Consequently,” “Therefore”).  
- Replace informal expressions like “maybe as low as 700 to 9000 in local currency” with precise and formally phrased alternatives, such as “in some cases, migrant workers earn between 700 and 9,000 units of local currency per month.”  
- Be explicit about time frames and currency units to avoid ambiguity.

3. **Polishing Register and Tone:**  
Aim for a more academic tone by avoiding colloquialisms and vague phrases. For example, instead of “I think,” use more assertive phrases like “It is evident that...” or “Research indicates...”

4. **Iterative Engagement:**  
To deepen your editing skills and maximize AI collaboration:  
- Share each revised paragraph or section you write.  
- Ask for targeted feedback on specific points (e.g., tone, clarity, grammar).  
- Experiment with different phrasings and ask which version sounds best.  
This back-and-forth will help you critically evaluate AI suggestions and maintain your personal voice.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 15/25 - The writer expresses a position (support for stronger laws to protect migrants) and identifies reasons (long hours, low pay), but ideas are unclear, repetitive, and underdeveloped. Many sentences obscure the intended meaning (e.g., "It argues that government starts turning serious strikes low to protect about the majority workers' rights").
- Organization: 14/25 - Paragraphing exists but topic sentences are weak or missing, transitions are poor, and the logical progression is difficult to follow (paragraphs contain fragments and off-topic sentences).
- Vocabulary: 14/25 - Some correct lexical choices but frequent inaccurate or confusing word forms (e.g., "remining," "welfare pay," "referee the state law") that disrupt meaning.
- Grammar: 13/25 - Frequent grammatical errors (articles, verb forms, prepositions, sentence fragments) that often impede understanding (e.g., "Many migrants may have tried to work more than 10 years or longer for people in living somewhere need to work 16 hours a day with no real time").
- **Original Essay Total: 56/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised essay has a clear thesis ("I believe governments should enforce stronger laws to protect their rights, mainly because they often work very long hours and receive low pay.") and two explicit reasons. The discussion is more focused and relevant, though development could be strengthened with more specific evidence or data.
- Organization: 21/25 - Paragraphs are better structured with clear topic sentences and logical progression (e.g., "First, many migrants work extremely long hours..." followed by supporting details). Transitions are simple but adequate.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Word choice is clearer and more accurate than the original. Some informal phrasing remains (e.g., "maybe as low as 700 to 9000 in local currency per month") and numbers could be presented more precisely.
- Grammar: 20/25 - Sentence structure and grammar show noticeable improvement: sentences are mostly correct and readable, with fewer distracting errors. A few awkward phrasings remain but do not block comprehension.
- **Revised Essay Total: 82/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +26 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clear, direct thesis statement that answers the prompt and previews reasons: "I believe governments should enforce stronger laws to protect their rights, mainly because they often work very long hours and receive low pay."
  - Stronger topic sentences and paragraph unity (example: "First, many migrants work extremely long hours..." replaces the unclear original opening).
  - Considerably improved grammar and sentence clarity across paragraphs; the supporting sentences in the revised long-hours paragraph are coherent and focused.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Use more specific, verifiable evidence or examples (e.g., cite country-level statistics or credible sources rather than broad ranges like "700 to 9000").
  - Strengthen cohesion with clearer linking phrases and a concluding sentence that synthesizes the argument in each paragraph.
  - Improve register and precision (avoid informal constructions and clarify currency/time frames).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 5** (assistant greeting & plan; user request; assistant diagnostic & plan; user instruction to revise; assistant confirms plan and asks for thesis/paragraph choice)
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided a clear, scaffolded revision workflow (three-step plan: thesis, topic sentence, revise paragraph). The student accepted the plan and requested the three requested revisions. The interaction is structured and goal-oriented, but relatively brief and with limited iteration visible in the supplied chat transcript.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Developing. The chat shows a focused, organized exchange with relevant guidance and diagnostic feedback. However, the conversation is short (only five turns) and lacks the extended back-and-forth (multiple revision cycles or probing clarification questions) expected for a higher score.
  - Evidence: assistant lays out steps and diagnostic; student selects targets ("You. can Revise thesis statement, Revise topic sentences, Revise one body paragraph."), but there are no subsequent iterative drafts or follow-up clarifying questions in the supplied history.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - Basic. The student accepted the assistant's plan and requested revisions but did not appear to critically evaluate or selectively accept/reject suggestions in the recorded chat. There is little evidence of the student questioning, offering counterarguments, or justifying alternative choices.
  - Evidence: The student concurs and asks the assistant to perform the three steps; no instances of student pushing back or evaluating specific AI edits are present in the chat.
- **Refining Process**: 3/5 - Developing. There is evidence of a structured revision plan and at least one iteration (the final revised essay shows the changes), but the chat does not show multiple rounds of revision, in-line edits, or a documented iterative review process.
  - Evidence: Assistant provides a stepwise method and the student requests the three revisions; however, the chat transcript ends before multiple draft exchanges or in-depth editorial negotiation are visible.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 8/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear adoption of AI guidance: The student followed the assistant's three-step workflow and produced a clearer thesis and better-organized paragraph (evidence: improved thesis and revised first body paragraph in the revised essay).
- Noticeable language accuracy gains: The revised paragraphs show far fewer grammatical errors and clearer sentence structures, improving reader comprehension.
- Focused argumentative stance: The revised thesis succinctly states the position and previews reasons, which helps the essay read more purposefully.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Evidence and specificity: Add concrete data, examples, or citations to substantiate claims (e.g., specific law examples, country statistics, or credible reports).
- More iterative engagement with AI: Use multiple short revision cycles—submit a revision, request targeted feedback, and then refine further—so that the assistant's suggestions can be critically reviewed and tested.
- Precision and register: Tighten phrasing and formalize language (replace informal ranges and ambiguous references with precise figures and clear currency/time units).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student gave the assistant a clear task list and expressed the desired outcomes ("I want my essay be more well-founded, clear, precise."). The assistant also supplied a plan aligned with course goals.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The assistant's structured three-step plan was accepted and followed; the student implemented the suggested focus on thesis and paragraph-level revision.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student largely accepted AI suggestions without visible critique or selective adoption in the chat history. More explicit evaluation of alternative rewrites would strengthen this skill.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The revised essay indicates the student (either alone or with AI help) produced coherent, improved text; however, evidence of the student's own editing decisions (versus AI edits) is limited in the chat transcript.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Strengthen evidence use: When making claims (e.g., about pay or working hours), include specific, sourced figures or clear hypothetical examples. This increases credibility and persuasiveness.
2. Increase iterative revision cycles: After receiving AI suggestions, respond with brief counter-proposals or edits, then ask for targeted feedback (e.g., "I changed X — is the tone more formal now?"). That will improve critical evaluation and refinement.
3. Improve cohesion and academic register: Work on cohesive devices (therefore, moreover, consequently) and replace vague ranges with precise figures or clarified estimates (state currency and time period).

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student met the assignment goals by explicitly revising the thesis, a topic sentence, and a body paragraph. The changes represent meaningful improvement in clarity and grammar.
- Encourage the student to document more of the revision process in the chat (e.g., paste intermediate drafts, explain choices) so instructors can better evaluate their critical engagement with AI suggestions.
- Consider asking the student to add one concrete data point or source in support of a claim (e.g., a cited survey or government statistic) to demonstrate an ability to integrate evidence alongside language revision.

If you would like, I can:
- Highlight sentence-level edits made between original and revised drafts,
- Offer a next revision pass focused on adding precise evidence and raising formality, or
- Provide a short checklist the student can use to guide future AI-assisted revisions.

Set 2 
Task 1
The chart analyzes the unemployment rate gap between migrant and local nature-born population in 10 countries in 2022. In general, the unemployment rate of the situation of native-born population outperforming migrants is more than the unemployment rate of the situation of migrant’s population outperforming native-born. Below are the analyzing of the chart. 

First, the situation of native-born population outperforming migrants is most likely to appear in developed countries, such as Sweden, Britain, France, etc. The highest unemployment rate of native-born population outperforming migrants appears in Spain (12.9%), the second is Italy (8.1%). In this situation, South Korea remining the lowest unemployment rate which is 2.9%. The unemployment rates will become higher when native-born population outperforming migrants. 

On the other hand, the unemployment rate of the situation of migrant’s population outperforming native-born not likely to appear in any one kind of countries. It appears more in four of 10 selected countries which is CR, SK, US, and AU. The highest unemployment rate is Croatia (13.2%), second is Slovakia (6.2%). However, those two developed countries (US, AU) remining lower unemployment rate which in only 3.6% and 3.7%. It can be observed that unemployment rate will be lower when migrant’s population outperforming native-born. 

In conclusion, in this chart, we can see the situation of native-born population outperforming migrants of unemployment rates are overall higher than the unemployment rate of the situation of migrant’s population outperforming native-born. 


 
Task 2
Recording migrants' workers appear more in different countries, the problem of them also appears far in the first and third. It argues that government starts turning serious strikes low to protect about the majority workers' rights. It will discuss why stem as in two points — such works enduring long working hours and their welfare pay of them.

Firstly, Firstly, for the long working hours, migrants are finding a welfare working environment and workers found unsafe for healthcare. They will be protected by the law of welfare laws, such as those being set the highest working hours for safeguards, workers' rights. However, many countries didn't see the law to ensure the working hours of migrant workers are unsafe since and avoidable. Many migrants may have tried to work more than 10 years or longer for people in living somewhere need to work 16 hours a day with no real time. The migrant worker does not want there or how to protect their rights and likely to be dangerous by the boss that without assistance. Firstly, even when you are the new show that the migrant waters, worked outdoor and causes cause disease. Therefore, I agree that government should set the law.

Secondly, for the urban property, many migrant workers facing the unfair pay they wouldn't do a long time a day and only getting a few salary. For example, to have a day and only get 700 - 9000 salary. It shows that many migrant workers facing the underpay and it is not equal to their work time. Therefore, I think that government should referee the state law to safeguard their rights.

Some people said monetary due to transportation or village and if payments sold for to protect those goods

Some might say while setting up the laws, the unemployment rates of head and notice-born workers will higher and so increase the reason that cause wage unemployment is not just because of the migrant workers, but the global issue of economic. In addition, the appeal of more stringent orders is already being a global issue and appearing in several of many different countries. So, the urgent things that we should do for facing this issue is that seeker enforce the law to secure those proposals having a fair working environment. Remark it is not only for the economic issue but also to overcome the human being, yet so!

To conclusion, I agree that the government should separate the state's laws to safeguard migrant workers' rights based on the state's that a migrant worker facing 2 we should create a to battle worker movement to them at time level point than autonomy and fair.

Task 1
The chart compares the unemployment rates of migrant and native-born populations in ten countries in 2022. Overall, in most countries, the unemployment rate is higher for migrants than for native-born citizens.  

In developed countries like Sweden, Britain, and France, migrants tend to experience higher unemployment than locals. Spain shows the largest gap, with migrant unemployment reaching 12.9%, followed by Italy at 8.1%. South Korea has the smallest gap, with migrant unemployment only 2.9% higher.  

In contrast, in four countries—Croatia, Slovakia, the US, and Australia—native-born citizens actually have higher unemployment than migrants. Croatia has the highest rate here at 13.2%, then Slovakia at 6.2%. The US and Australia show smaller differences, around 3.6–3.7%.  

In summary, migrants usually face higher unemployment than locals, especially in developed European nations, though there are a few exceptions.


Task 2 
Nowadays, more migrant workers are moving abroad for work, but they often face serious problems. I believe governments should enforce stronger laws to protect their rights, mainly because they often work very long hours and receive low pay.

First, many migrants work extremely long hours, sometimes up to 16 hours a day, without proper breaks or overtime pay. This is bad for their health, and they often work in unsafe conditions. For example, those working outdoors can develop illnesses from heat or poor safety measures. Even though some countries have laws to limit working hours, these aren’t always followed for migrant workers. So, governments need to make sure these rules are actually enforced.

Second, migrant workers are often underpaid. Sometimes they work all day but earn very little—maybe as low as 700 to 9000 in local currency per month—which isn’t fair compared to the work they do. Some employers take advantage of them because they don’t know their rights or are afraid to complain. Therefore, laws should ensure fair wages for everyone.

Some argue that stricter laws might raise unemployment for local workers, but unemployment is usually caused by wider economic issues, not just migrants. Also, protecting workers is a global concern—many countries already face these problems. What’s urgent is making sure migrant workers can work in fair and safe conditions.

In conclusion, governments should pass and enforce laws to protect migrant workers’ rights, especially regarding working hours and pay. This isn’t just good for the economy—it’s a matter of basic human fairness.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-06T21:19:55.154Z

**You:** help me see any grammar mistake , correct it , and help e see any way I can improve i

*Time:* 2025-12-06T22:19:08.958Z

**Assistant:** Great — I can help. Before I start editing, let’s agree what to work on so the session is focused and useful.

1) Quick question about your goals
- Which of these do you want to focus on today? (Pick one or two.)
  a) Grammar and sentence-level accuracy (grammar, articles, verbs, word order)  
  b) Clarity and coherence (clear meaning, easy to follow)  
  c) Thesis and argument strength (clear answer to the question and preview)  
  d) Organisation and paragraph unity (topic sentences, logical flow)  
  e) Vocabulary and word choice (more precise academic language)

Tell me your choice(s). I recommend focusing on (a) Grammar and (c) Thesis/argument — because your draft has many grammar errors and the main claim is unclear. Do you agree?

2) Brief diagnostic feedback (based on the rubric)
- Content & ideas: Developing. You have a clear position (you support stronger laws) but the argument is repetitive and underdeveloped. Needs clearer reasons and examples.
- Organisation & progression: Developing to basic. Paragraphs are unclear, topic sentences are weak, and ideas don’t progress logically.
- Vocabulary: Basic. Some word choices are confused (e.g., “remining,” “welfare pay,” “referee the state law”). Use simpler, accurate words first.
- Grammar & sentence structure: Limited. Frequent errors with articles, verb tense, word order, prepositions, and sentence fragments make meaning hard to follow.

3) Which problem(s) do you want to work on now?
Please pick from your chosen goals above (for example: “Grammar + Thesis”). Once you confirm, we’ll move to the three-step revision:

Step 1 (Thesis): I’ll ask you to share the exact sentence you intend as your thesis (or confirm which sentence in your draft is the thesis). I’ll give feedback and ask you to try a revised thesis.

Step 2 (Topic sentence): You’ll pick one body paragraph to work on. We’ll improve its topic sentence so it links clearly to the thesis.

Step 3 (That paragraph): We’ll revise the supporting sentences in that paragraph for clarity, unity, and correctness.

Would you like to:
- Focus on Grammar + Thesis (my recommendation), or
- Focus on different targets?

If you agree, please copy the sentence you want as your thesis (or say “use my conclusion sentence”) and tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (e.g., “the paragraph about long working hours” or “the second body paragraph”). Then I’ll give feedback and ask you to try a revision.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T22:19:31.299Z

**You:** You. can Revise thesis statement, Revise topic sentences,  Revise one body paragraph. I want my essay be more well-founded, clear, precise.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T22:21:13.701Z

**Assistant:** Great — this is a good plan. Let’s confirm targets, do a quick diagnosis, and then start the three-step revision workflow.

1) Confirm targets
You said you want the essay to be more well-founded, clear, and precise. I suggest we focus on:
- Thesis & argument strength (so your main claim is clear and previews your reasons) and
- Clarity/coherence at sentence and paragraph level (so readers can follow your ideas).

Do you agree with those two targets? If yes, we’ll continue. If you prefer to include grammar (article/verb) as well, say so — we can keep an eye on grammar while focusing on thesis and clarity.

2) Brief diagnostic feedback (short, linked to the rubric)
- Content & ideas: Developing. You have a clear position (you support stronger government protection) but reasons are unclear, repetitive, and some examples aren’t specific or believable.
- Organisation & progression: Developing/Basic. Paragraphs lack clear topic sentences and logical flow. Some sentences are fragments or off-topic.
- Vocabulary: Basic. Some word choices are incorrect or confusing (e.g., “remining,” “referee the state law”).
- Grammar & sentence structure: Limited. Frequent errors (articles, verb forms, word order) sometimes obscure meaning.

3) Choose priorities from the diagnosis
Which two things do you want to work on now? (Pick one or two)
a) Strengthen the thesis so it answers the question and previews 2–3 clear reasons.
b) Improve one body paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences) so it ties to the thesis and reads clearly.
c) Fix sentence-level grammar and word choice in that paragraph.

My recommendation: focus on (a) Thesis and (b) one body paragraph (long working hours). That will make the essay clearer and more persuasive. Do you agree?

If yes, we’ll begin Step 1.

Step 1 — Thesis statement
Please copy here the exact sentence you want to be the thesis. If you prefer, you can say “use my conclusion sentence” and I’ll use the sentence you have in the conclusion. (But it’s better if you paste the exact line.)

Quick guidance to help you rewrite (try now before I give examples):
- Make a clear answer to the question: Should governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights? (Yes or No + short reason)
- Preview 2–3 main reasons (e.g., long hours, low pay, unsafe conditions).
- Use confident, precise language (avoid “I think,” “maybe,” and vague phrases).

Would you like to paste your thesis now (or confirm use of the conclusion sentence)? Also tell me which body paragraph you want to revise — I recommend “the paragraph about long working hours” (your first reason).
