            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing the chat history and your assessment details. Based on everything, here are some targeted suggestions to help move the student forward:

1. **Encourage Active Revision**  
   The student’s current interaction shows initial engagement but no actual text revision yet. Prompt the student explicitly to rewrite the thesis statement using the feedback you've already provided. For example, ask:  
   *“Based on the suggestions, please write a clearer thesis statement that expresses your view on how automation affects global employment, and include your main points clearly.”*

2. **Model a Strong Thesis**  
   Provide a model thesis statement as an example to help the student understand what a revised thesis could look like:  
   *“Automation likely enhances global employment prospects in the long term by increasing wages, fostering competition that encourages innovation, and presenting challenges that motivate improvements in labor conditions.”*  
   Then invite the student to compare and try to emulate it.

3. **Focus on Incremental Improvements**  
   Since the student’s original writing contains many language difficulties, encourage small, focused revisions rather than a perfect rewrite all at once. For example:  
   - First, fix clarity and word choice in the thesis only.  
   - Next, revise topic sentences one by one.  
   - Then, work on grammar and vocabulary in body paragraphs.

4. **Encourage Reflection and Interaction**  
   Remind the student to actively reflect on AI feedback by asking for their opinion:  
   *“Do you agree with this suggestion? How would you change the wording? What ideas do you want to keep or emphasize?”*  
   This supports developing critical evaluation and collaboration skills.

5. **Provide Strategic Guidance**  
   The student needs a clearer roadmap. Suggest a simple revision plan like:  
   - Step 1: Thesis statement revision  
   - Step 2: Revise topic sentences to reflect thesis points  
   - Step 3: Edit body paragraphs for clarity, grammar, vocabulary  
   - Step 4: Review overall flow and coherence

6. **Boost Confidence and Motivation**  
   Acknowledge the effort so far and emphasize that revision is a normal, gradual process requiring multiple drafts. Encourage the student that making even small improvements is progress.

---

If you like, I can help you draft a prompt or message for the student that incorporates these points and encourages the next step in revision. Would that be helpful?

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay writing skills**: Actively implement feedback and make actual revisions to thesis statements, topic sentences, and body paragraphs as required by the assignment.
2. **AI collaboration skills**: Engage more fully with the AI—ask clarifying questions, reflect on feedback, and collaboratively workshop ideas rather than just pasting text.
3. **Overall improvement**: Develop a routine of iterative drafting and reflection, using both AI feedback and independent judgment to maximize essay clarity and impact.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
Student has not yet completed any required revision tasks; progress reflects only initial engagement. Recommend re-engagement with the revision process and demonstration of revision work in the next submission. Encourage the student to focus on specific, meaningful changes and to leverage the AI for deeper learning, not just procedural completion.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement:  
*"In conclusion, automation enhances global employment prospect in the long term caused by wage increasing, competitive cognition and unconvenience of using automation. Leven use automation reasonable making the life of the world better."*

Let’s start with some feedback:

**Clarity:**  
- The thesis is a bit difficult to understand due to some word choices and grammar errors.
- "Leven use" is unclear—perhaps you meant "even use" or "when using"?
- The reasons (wage increasing, competitive cognition, and unconvenience) need to be clearer and more logically explained.

**Strength:**  
- Try to be more direct and confident.
- Avoid starting a thesis with phrases like "In conclusion".

**Focus:**  
- The statement should answer the essay question directly and preview the main points in a logical order.
- Use clear and specific language about how automation affects global employment prospects in the long term.

**Tips for Revision:**
- State clearly if you agree or disagree (or partially agree) with the idea that automation enhances global employment in the long term.
- Briefly mention your main points (wages, competition, challenges of automation).
- Use precise, academic vocabulary.

**Your Turn!**
Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now, using this advice? Try to write **one or two clear sentences** that answer the essay question and preview your main arguments. When you’re ready, share your revision here and I will give you feedback!
