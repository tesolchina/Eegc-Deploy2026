#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided an outline, thesis, and clear response to AI prompts, making expectations and context clear.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student prioritized targets and followed a logical revision sequence for selected sections.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good - The student sometimes modified or expanded on AI advice, though more independent critique would help.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - Revision is still heavily scaffolded by the AI, and stops after one focused section.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing Skills**: Apply the revision cycle (thesis/topic/paragraph refinement) to all essay parts, ensuring comprehensive improvement and essay-wide coherence.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills**: Experiment with rejecting or modifying AI suggestions, and initiate follow-up questions or deeper edits for style and vocabulary.
3. **Overall Improvement**: After revising core content and structure, dedicate time to post-revision proofreading for grammar and stylistic polish.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student made strong progress in revising one body paragraph and demonstrated solid collaboration with the AI for targeted revision goals.
- However, the student did not complete revision for the entire essay. Only the thesis, one topic sentence, and one body paragraph were addressed (“stop here” was selected), not the conclusion or other body paragraphs.
- For full credit and maximal development, encourage the student to apply the stepwise revision process to each major essay section in future revision activities.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Al and automation are changing how people work. Machines and smart sottware can do many tasks faster and cheaper. These This can ste nisks workes as it many replace many jobs. But it also helps for new bloods as somejob related to Af at can appear. In the long nun, I think AL can growjobs, if we guide it well.
Nowadays there wo ere mere and move guaduated college stadents Today is much döfferent than the past. In the past, people who did not be educated can still get one's own job. But today, hearly noone
no one choose not to go to school, also the deportment would not hire someone who did not been edueatod. In these case, Even th
though there are more and more skilled people, the jobs aid not amont ofjobs does not enhance. d n there case, students who spent money and great time to study can atiotill cant find a jab,
Now something changed the suret situation. When Al tasts become more and more popular, it do provides more jabs. Most importaty, these jous are fon those students are educated and skilled. Not likely to clean the streets or wash deshes at a restrarant, these Jobs are more aeceptable for these new guaduated Audents, In Lotat, ESo, I would say that A1 technolalgy menhance global emplayment prospects.
Perhaps you hill ask, what the about the workers that I mentionad at the beginity? Some of them ate are not now not young, but also not ole anoh to be sech as elderly and be protected.
Tarly they are poor. New technologies replaced many jobs of from the workeks. All they can do is to find new jobs. Bet However, those Wors camihich need people not educated can mostly be done by new tochnolgies. What can the workens do next? They can learn some new skills, which is incredibly dittäcult, on they can do nothing. That is the negetive part of the development of At too/s. New new lechnolgies.
Anyway, people who did not been eduacated would be less and less due to the society development. So in a long term, it will be ok. & Maybe one day the concept of human workers will disappear and all we khow is skilled person and machine 

Revised:
While AI and automation replace some routine jobs at first, strong training, fair policies, and new roles in AI support and data work can help these tools increase overall employment in the long run.
AI and automation are reshaping the job market for college graduates by demanding new skills and creating new types of roles. Many entry-level tasks are now done by software, which means fewer routine openings and more competition. To stand out, graduates need data skills, skill with AI prompts, basic coding, and clear writing. At the same time, AI creates new positions such as AI support, data analysis, model testing, and content review with AI tools. For instance, a marketing graduate can use AI to draft posts, but must also edit, check facts, and analyze results to ensure quality. In hospitals, graduates can help run AI screening tools and protect patient privacy. In schools, they can help teachers use AI to plan lessons and review drafts. Short courses and internships can help students build these skills. In summary, while AI makes the job search harder in some areas, it also opens doors for prepared graduates. This is why training and fair policy matter for young workers.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-15T12:14:18.760Z

**You:** let‘s start

*Time:* 2025-11-15T12:59:16.299Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s begin with the **Preliminary Stage** — we’ll negotiate your learning targets and diagnose your essay before we start revising.

---

### 1. **Negotiate Targets**

**First question:**  
What do *you* want to improve most in your essay today?  
For example, are you most interested in:
- Making your main argument clearer?
- Improving how your essay is organized?
- Using more precise vocabulary?

Here’s a brief diagnosis of your current essay:

**Thesis & Argument:**  
- Your thesis needs to be clearer and more focused.
- The main idea is present (AI changes jobs), but it’s a little unclear and not well-developed.

**Organization:**  
- The essay is divided into paragraphs, but ideas sometimes jump around and the connections are not always clear.
- Some paragraphs are hard to follow.

**Evidence & Development:**  
- You raise relevant examples, like college graduates and job changes, but explanations are often basic and need more detail.

**Vocabulary:**  
- There’s some topic-specific vocabulary (AI, automation).
- Many spelling errors and some confusion with words.

**Grammar & Sentence Structure:**  
- Many sentences have grammar errors or are difficult to understand.
- Structure is often simple or repetitive.

**Strengths:**  
- You raise thoughtful points about how AI affects jobs.
- You try to discuss both positive and negative sides.
- Paragraphs are attempted, showing organization effort.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- Thesis clarity and confidence.
- Organization and flow of ideas.
- Precise vocabulary and correct grammar.
- Developing your explanations and examples.

---

### 3. **Student Priority Selection**

**Now:**  
From my feedback above, which *two* areas do you want to focus on during this revision?  
(For example: thesis clarity, organization, vocabulary, grammar, or explanation development).

**Please choose** your priorities so we can confirm and begin Step 1!

*Time:* 2025-11-15T12:59:22.780Z

**You:** Here is my thesis:

AI and automation will replace some routine jobs in the short term. With strong training and fair policy, they can grow overall employment in the long run.

Here is my outline:

Paragraph 1 introduces the topic. It shows why AI at work matters now. It ends with my thesis.

Paragraph 2 explains short-term job loss. It shows how machines take routine tasks. It gives simple examples, like chatbots in customer service, self-checkout in stores, and data entry tools. It explains why this hurts some workers.

Paragraph 3 shows long-term job growth. It lists new roles, like AI support, data analysis, model testing, and human oversight. It gives examples of human–machine teams in factories and clinics. It explains how higher productivity can create more demand and new jobs.

Paragraph 4 answers concerns about displaced workers. It proposes clear steps: skills training, short courses, employer programs, and public support. It explains how policy and education can guide AI so more people benefit.

Paragraph 5 concludes. It restates the thesis. It balances the risks and the gains. It calls for action: invest in skills and smart rules so AI helps workers.

*Time:* 2025-11-15T13:02:03.458Z

**Assistant:** Thank you! This is a great, detailed response—your outline shows a clear understanding of your essay’s direction. Now let’s move step-by-step, as promised.

---

## Step 1: Confirming Your Revision Targets

### Your Choices
Based on your answer and my feedback, let’s confirm:
1. Your thesis clarity and confidence
2. Organization and logical flow

Is this correct? Are these the two you want to work on—**thesis clarity/confidence** and **organization/flow**—or do you want to include vocabulary, grammar, or explanation development as well? (You can keep it to two for a focused session!)  
**Please confirm so we can proceed.**

---

## Step 2: Thesis Statement Revision

You provided this thesis:

> AI and automation will replace some routine jobs in the short term. With strong training and fair policy, they can grow overall employment in the long run.

This is clear and concise—nicely improved!  
Let’s check if it meets the criteria:

**Checklist:**  
- Clearly answers the essay question: ✔️  
- Previews main points/structure: ➖ (It hints at them but could be a bit more specific)
- Uses confident, precise language: ✔️  
- Avoids hedging (“I think,” “maybe”): ✔️  

**Possible improvement:**  
To strengthen this for academic style and to preview your main argument, try to include both sides (risk and opportunity) and mention the role of policy/training. You can also combine the two sentences for conciseness.

**For example (not to copy directly):**  
> While AI and automation will replace certain routine jobs in the short term, fair policies and strong training programs can ensure that, in the long run, these technologies will increase overall employment opportunities.

**Your turn!**  
Would you like to try revising your thesis to include a little more about “how” or “why”—maybe mentioning new jobs or preparation—so your reader knows what to expect?  
Type your revised thesis, or let me know if you would like more hints.

---

Let’s pause here so you can try your own revised thesis. When you’re happy with it, reply and we’ll move to topic sentence revision!

*Time:* 2025-11-15T13:02:10.309Z

**You:** Yes, those are my two priorities: thesis clarity and organization/flow. We can fix grammar at the end.

Here is my revised thesis:
While AI and automation replace some routine jobs at first, strong training, fair policies, and new roles in AI support and data work can help these tools increase overall employment in the long run.

*Time:* 2025-11-15T13:04:13.707Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic work! Your revised thesis shows great progress:

> While AI and automation replace some routine jobs at first, strong training, fair policies, and new roles in AI support and data work can help these tools increase overall employment in the long run.

**Quick feedback:**  
- **Clarity:** Very clear—explains both the problem (“routine jobs replaced”) and solution (“training, policy, new roles”).
- **Confidence:** Strong, academic style (no “I think,” “maybe”).
- **Preview of Structure:** Now readers know you will discuss (1) job losses, (2) need for training/policy, and (3) new types of jobs.
- **Connection to the question:** Excellent—you answer the prompt directly!

**Ready to move on?**  
If you’re happy with this thesis, let’s continue to Step 2: **Topic Sentence Revision**.

---

## Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision

**Instructions:**  
Please choose one body paragraph from your essay that you’d like to improve—maybe the one about college graduates, or the one about older workers and AI.

Copy and paste that paragraph’s topic sentence (the first sentence of the body paragraph) here so we can check:

- Does it clearly relate to your new thesis?
- Does it preview what the paragraph will be about?

Once you share the topic sentence, I’ll give suggestions, and you’ll have a chance to revise it!

**Which paragraph and topic sentence do you want to work on first?**

*Time:* 2025-11-15T13:04:19.031Z

**You:** I want to work on the paragraph about college graduates and the job market.

Topic sentence: Nowadays there are more and more college graduates.

*Time:* 2025-11-15T13:06:27.445Z

**Assistant:** Great choice! Let’s look at your topic sentence:

> Nowadays there are more and more college graduates.

### Feedback

- **Clarity:** The sentence is clear, but it’s a bit general. It doesn’t directly connect to AI, automation, or your thesis.
- **Connection to Thesis:** It doesn’t yet show how college graduates and the job market relate to the impact of AI and automation.
- **Preview:** The reader doesn’t know what aspect of college graduates you will focus on (their job search? challenges? new job types?).

### Next Steps

Let’s strengthen this topic sentence so it:
- Ties directly to the thesis (the effect of AI/automation on employment).
- Previews the main idea of the paragraph (how AI impacts college graduates and job opportunities).

**Hint:**  
You might want to mention how the changing job market—affected by AI and automation—presents both challenges and new opportunities for college graduates.

#### Example structure (to guide, not to copy directly):

- “With the rise of AI and automation, college graduates are facing a job market that demands new skills and offers new kinds of opportunities.”
or
- “The increasing number of college graduates must adapt to a job market transformed by AI and automation.”

---

**Your turn:**  
Would you like to try revising your topic sentence to show:
- The link between AI/automation and college graduates’ job prospects?
- What the rest of your paragraph will focus on?

When you’re ready, type your revised topic sentence!  
Would you like a hint, or do you want to try it yourself first?

*Time:* 2025-11-15T13:06:33.686Z

**You:** AI and automation are reshaping the job market for college graduates. They require new skills and offer new kinds of roles.

*Time:* 2025-11-15T13:08:09.429Z

**Assistant:** Excellent effort! Your revised topic sentence is much clearer and connects directly to your thesis. Let’s review it together:

> **AI and automation are reshaping the job market for college graduates. They require new skills and offer new kinds of roles.**

### Feedback

**Strengths:**
- **Connection to Thesis:** It directly links AI and automation to college graduates’ employment prospects.
- **Clarity:** The sentence is clear and easy to understand.
- **Preview:** It shows that the paragraph will be about both the challenges (“require new skills”) and opportunities (“new kinds of roles”) for college graduates.

**Possible enhancement:**  
To make the topic sentence even stronger, you could combine the ideas into one confident, academic sentence. This would help with flow and organization. For example:

“AI and automation are reshaping the job market for college graduates by demanding new skills and creating new types of roles.”

Would you like to try combining your two sentences into one, or are you satisfied with your current version?

---

**Please reply with your final topic sentence—and then we’ll move to revising the rest of your paragraph for clarity and logical flow!**

---

## Step 3: Revising the Paragraph Content

Now, let’s look at your chosen paragraph.  
Here’s your current draft (with some spelling fixes for clarity):

---

**Original Paragraph:**
Nowadays there are more and more college graduates. Today is much different than the past. In the past, people who were not educated could still get a job. But today, nearly no one chooses not to go to school, and companies would not hire someone who has not been educated. In this case, even though there are more and more skilled people, the number of jobs does not increase. Students who spent money and time to study still cannot find a job.

---

**Guiding Questions:**
- Do all sentences support your topic sentence?
- Is it clear how AI and automation are affecting graduates’ job searches?
- Can you add or clarify an example of “new roles” that AI creates for graduates?
- Is there repetition or anything that could be worded more smoothly?

**Let’s revise together:**
- Identify any sentences that don’t clearly fit with the topic sentence (about AI and graduates).
- See if you can add a sentence explaining *how AI creates new roles or opportunities* for graduates.
- Clarify any sentences that feel repetitive or unclear.

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try rewriting one or two sentences in your paragraph to better link them to your topic sentence, or to add explanation about new opportunities (e.g., jobs in AI, data, or tech)?

For example:  
- How are college graduates affected by these changes?
- Can you give an example of a “new kind of role” they might do?

Let me know your ideas or post your improved sentences—we’ll keep building together!

*Time:* 2025-11-15T13:08:16.472Z

**You:** Here is my final topic sentence:
AI and automation are reshaping the job market for college graduates by demanding new skills and creating new types of roles.

Here is my revised paragraph:
Many entry-level tasks are now done by software. This means fewer routine openings and more competition. To stand out, graduates need data skills, good prompts for AI tools, basic coding, and clear writing. At the same time, AI creates new roles. Examples include AI support, data analysis, model testing, and content review with AI tools. For example, a marketing graduate can use AI to draft posts, but must edit, check facts, and study results. In hospitals, graduates help run AI screening tools and protect patient privacy. Short courses and internships can help students build these skills. So AI makes job search harder in some areas, but it also opens doors for prepared graduates.

**Assistant:** Fantastic progress! You’ve shown excellent attention to both clarity and organization—your writing is much more focused and informative now.

Let’s walk through an interactive final review of your revised body paragraph and lightly polish for flow, unity, and coherence—aligned with your chosen targets (thesis clarity and organization).

## Final Step: Paragraph Review & Guided Suggestions

### Your Current Topic Sentence
> **AI and automation are reshaping the job market for college graduates by demanding new skills and creating new types of roles.**

**Excellent! It’s clear and connects perfectly to your thesis.**

### Your Current Paragraph
> Many entry-level tasks are now done by software. This means fewer routine openings and more competition. To stand out, graduates need data skills, good prompts for AI tools, basic coding, and clear writing. At the same time, AI creates new roles. Examples include AI support, data analysis, model testing, and content review with AI tools. For example, a marketing graduate can use AI to draft posts, but must edit, check facts, and study results. In hospitals, graduates help run AI screening tools and protect patient privacy. Short courses and internships can help students build these skills. So AI makes job search harder in some areas, but it also opens doors for prepared graduates.

### Guiding Questions & Feedback

**Support and Unity:**  
- Every sentence now relates well to the topic sentence’s promise of "new skills" and "new roles."
- Logical flow: Explains the challenges (“routine tasks replaced, more competition”) → skills needed → examples of new roles → suggestion (how to prepare) → conclusion.

**Clarity:**  
- Much improved. Your examples show details instead of just making general statements.
- Sentences generally clear, but you might smooth transitions between ideas.

**Coherence:**  
- Try connecting some ideas with linking words for smoother reading (for example, “Additionally,” “For instance,” “As a result,” etc.).

### Focused Suggestions (not full rewrites):

**1.** In sentence three, “To stand out, graduates need data skills, good prompts for AI tools, basic coding, and clear writing.”  
- Instead of “good prompts for AI tools,” you could say “prompt engineering skills for AI tools,” if you want a precise academic term.

**2.** For examples, consider linking them more tightly to the skills mentioned above:  
- “For example, a marketing graduate can use AI to draft posts, but must also edit, check facts, and analyze results to ensure quality.”
- You use “for example” twice—consider “Additionally,” or “In another field,” for variety.

**3.** Final sentence:  
- You might want to summarize the paragraph’s main point more decisively.  
- For example: “In summary, while AI and automation have made the job search more challenging in some areas, they also offer new opportunities to graduates who are well-prepared.”

**Would you like to try one or two sentence improvements using these suggestions? Or are you satisfied as is?**

**Full Revised Text (with Thesis and Paragraph):**

**Thesis Statement:**  
*While AI and automation replace some routine jobs at first, strong training, fair policies, and new roles in AI support and data work can help these tools increase overall employment in the long run.*

**Body Paragraph:**  
AI and automation are reshaping the job market for college graduates by demanding new skills and creating new types of roles. Many entry-level tasks are now done by software, which means fewer routine openings and more competition. To stand out, graduates need data skills, prompt engineering for AI tools, basic coding, and clear writing. At the same time, AI creates new positions such as AI support, data analysis, model testing, and content review with AI tools. For instance, a marketing graduate can use AI to draft posts, but must also edit, check facts, and analyze results to ensure quality. In hospitals, graduates may help run AI screening tools and protect patient privacy. Short courses and internships can help students build these skills. In summary, while AI makes job searching harder in some areas, it also opens doors for prepared graduates.
