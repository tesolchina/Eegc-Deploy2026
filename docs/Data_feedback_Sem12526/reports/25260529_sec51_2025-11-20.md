            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your assessment and chat history. Based on all this, here is a summary to help you move forward effectively:

---

**Key Points from Your Assessment and Interaction:**

- The thesis statement was never actually revised; placeholders like “bla bla bla” were used instead of an authentic revision.
- The first body paragraph was not revised—only indicated with placeholders—and thus missing deeper argument development and coherence improvements.
- The revised essay contains serious gaps due to incomplete revisions.
- You did revise the second body paragraph’s topic sentence with a clearer evaluative stance (“These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter.”).
- Your collaboration with the AI was minimal: you repeatedly avoided revising the thesis and paragraph #1, often using placeholders and skipping steps.
- The AI prompted you several times to produce actual text to maintain a coherent, iterative revision process, but these requests were not met.
- Grammar and vocabulary remain weak, with many errors and general phrasing.
- Your willingness to continue was noted, but the lack of substantive edits limited meaningful progress.

---

**Recommendations for Your Next Steps:**

1. **Prioritize a Genuine Thesis Revision:**
   - Write one clear, confident sentence for your thesis.
   - It should state your stance on the essay question and preview your two main supporting points (government influence primary; personal actions secondary).
   - Example format you can adapt:  
     *“I partly agree that individual actions matter less than government and corporate measures, primarily because individuals influence climate policy through civic engagement, while personal lifestyle changes play a secondary but supportive role.”*  
   - Without this, your essay lacks clear direction.

2. **Fully Revise Body Paragraph #1:**
   - Begin with a strong, focused topic sentence that connects to your new thesis.
   - Develop two specific examples of political or civic influence on climate action (e.g., environmental protests, voting for green policies, government legislation).
   - Include analysis explaining how these civic efforts lead to systemic change.
   - Maintain clear, error-free sentences with varied structure.

3. **Maintain the Revised Second Body Paragraph Topic Sentence:**
   - Your improved topic sentence is a good foundation.
   - Build on it with clearer examples of household or consumer actions (e.g., recycling rates, green product choices) and their limitations.
   - Address why these personal choices matter despite scale limits.

4. **Engage in the Iterative Revision Process with the AI:**
   - Respond with real sentences or paragraphs for review.
   - Ask questions about clarity, tone, word choice, or grammar.
   - Accept or reject AI suggestions, explaining briefly why to deepen your learning and improve collaboration scores.
   - Avoid placeholders that stall progress.

5. **Focus on Grammar and Vocabulary:**
   - Proofread each revised section carefully.
   - Use transition phrases (“primarily,” “however,” “therefore”) to connect ideas.
   - Incorporate topic-specific terms where appropriate (e.g., “policy instruments,” “emissions targets,” “market signals”).

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - Clear stance (“I partly agree…”), two relevant lines of argument (civic influence; personal habits), and basic examples (“ban pollution,” “new rules about plastic,” “cutting carbon emissions”). Some claims are general and underdeveloped.
- Organization: 20/25 - Standard structure (introduction, two body paragraphs, conclusion) with logical sequencing. Topic sentences signal focus, but some internal sentences wander and repeat.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Adequate, mostly general vocabulary. Limited use of topic-specific terms beyond “carbon emissions,” “clean energy,” “recycling.”
- Grammar: 15/25 - Frequent errors affecting clarity (e.g., “so is not always working well,” “so nothing happen,” “it not really enough”), simple sentences, inconsistent tense and agreement.
- Original Essay Total: 74/100

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 10/25 - Significant placeholders (“bla bla bla (revised thesis statement here),” “revise the rest of body paragraph #1 ...”). Only one topic sentence in the second body paragraph appears revised (“These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter.”). Overall content is incomplete.
- Organization: 10/25 - Broken structure due to placeholders and incomplete revision; paragraph unity disrupted (e.g., “let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentence…” embedded in the body).
- Vocabulary: 11/25 - Presence of placeholders (“bla bla bla”), minimal academic vocabulary. Limited precision.
- Grammar: 11/25 - Persistent errors plus non-academic placeholders; inconsistent capitalization and punctuation (e.g., “revised topic sentenceThese actions…”).
- Revised Essay Total: 42/100

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- Overall Improvement: -32 points
- Key Improvements Made:
  - The second body paragraph’s topic sentence was strengthened to foreground evaluation (“These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter.”).
- Missed Opportunities:
  - Thesis statement not revised despite specific guidance.
  - Body paragraph #1 not revised; content left as placeholders, preventing meaningful improvements in argument depth, cohesion, and language accuracy.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- Total Exchanges: 13
- Conversation Quality: The assistant provided clear, step-by-step guidance and scaffolds. The student repeatedly attempted to skip required steps and used placeholders (“let’s pretend we have revised…”), resulting in minimal substantive collaboration and no critical discussion of suggestions.

#### Interaction Scores:
- In-Depth Conversation: 2/5 - Although the number of messages is moderate, the depth is low; the student did not ask clarifying or probing questions and tried to bypass the process (e.g., “let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement”).
- Critical Review of AI Suggestions: 1/5 - No evidence of evaluating or justifying acceptance/rejection of AI suggestions; the student did not engage with the phrase banks or templates.
- Refining Process: 1/5 - No meaningful iterative revisions; thesis and body paragraph #1 were not revised despite multiple prompts.
- Human-AI Interaction Total: 4/15

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear original stance with two coherent lines of argument (civic/political influence as primary; personal habits as secondary), which aligns with course aims to articulate a viewpoint on global issues.
- The revised topic sentence in paragraph two shows awareness of weighing impact and signaling paragraph focus.
- Willingness to continue the session despite a temporary server error suggests persistence.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Complete required revision steps: Provide an actual revised thesis and full revision of at least one body paragraph to show substantive improvement.
- Develop ideas with specific, credible evidence (e.g., named policies, brief data, or case examples) to move beyond general statements.
- Improve grammar accuracy and sentence variety; focus on subject-verb agreement, articles, and transition coherence to strengthen readability.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Needs Improvement - The student did not restate assignment goals or constraints beyond the original essay; relied on placeholders rather than providing working text.
- Strategic Planning: Needs Improvement - Attempted to skip the agreed process (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), which undermined iterative progress.
- Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement - No explicit acceptance/rejection of suggestions; no rationale provided for choices.
- Independent Editing: Needs Improvement - Minimal genuine editing; placeholders (“bla bla bla”) replaced substantive work.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Essay writing skills: Draft a concise, confident thesis that signals primary (civic/political influence) and secondary (household/consumer actions) mechanisms; then revise one full body paragraph to include a clear topic sentence, two specific examples (policy or market cases), and explicit analysis linking back to your thesis.
2. AI collaboration skills: Follow the structured steps. Provide actual text at each stage, ask at least one clarifying question (e.g., about tone or word choice), and briefly explain why you accept or reject AI wording—this builds critical review and improves outcomes.
3. Overall improvement: Conduct a focused grammar pass on subject-verb agreement and sentence structure. Use transition signals (“primarily,” “secondarily,” “however,” “therefore”) to strengthen coherence, and replace general terms with precise vocabulary (e.g., “civic pressure,” “policy instruments,” “market signaling,” “emissions reduction targets”).

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
The student did not complete the mandatory thesis and body-paragraph revisions and inserted placeholders into the revised essay. Recommend a guided in-class revision activity where the student must produce:
- One finalized thesis (checked against a rubric).
- One revised topic sentence tied to the thesis.
- One fully revised body paragraph with examples and analysis.
Encourage the student to engage with AI prompts by providing actual text and brief rationales for edits to improve collaboration scores.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:

*Time:* 2025-11-20T14:24:21.803Z

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-20T13:13:56.556Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-20T13:17:26.947Z

**Assistant:** Great to work with you on this. We’ll follow the three-step process carefully. First, let’s focus only on your thesis.

Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision
I see this as your current thesis:
“I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”

Feedback on clarity, strength, and focus:
- Clarity: Your stance (partial agreement) and your two main reasons (political influence; personal lifestyle choices) are clear. Well done.
- Strength: It’s a bit long and uses softer language (“I believe,” “I also think”). For a stronger academic tone, use more confident verbs and tighter structure.
- Focus/preview: Make the two main points explicit with precise terms (e.g., “civic pressure/political participation” and “household behaviors/consumer choices”), and signal the relative weight (“primarily/secondarily”).

Suggestions (not full sentences—use these as building blocks):
- Stance words: “I largely/partly agree,” “to a considerable extent,” “I contend/argue”
- Point 1 (primary): “individuals exert their greatest influence through civic pressure and political participation that shape policy”
- Point 2 (secondary): “household-level behaviors and consumer choices support change but are limited by scale”
- Linking/structure: “primarily… while secondarily…,” “chiefly… yet also…,” “although less impactful, … still…”

Template options (fill in and adjust in your own words):
- “I [largely/partly] agree that [individual actions are less impactful than systemic efforts], primarily because [individuals influence climate action most effectively through civic/political channels], while [household behaviors/consumer choices] [contribute by signaling demand] but [are limited in scale].”
- “To [a considerable/some] extent, I agree: [policy-level interventions by governments and corporations are decisive], yet [individuals remain consequential] mainly through [collective political engagement], with [personal green habits] playing a [supporting/secondary] role.”

Would you like to try revising your thesis now using the guidance above? Please share your revised thesis, and tell me if you’re satisfied with it. Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 2 (choosing one body paragraph and revising its topic sentence).

*Time:* 2025-11-20T13:17:56.818Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement 
 bla bla bla ...

*Time:* 2025-11-20T13:18:19.460Z

**Assistant:** Great—we’ll keep this focused and supportive. To move us forward, I do need your actual revised thesis (one sentence) in your own words so I can check it against the rubric and help you align the rest of the essay.

Quick checklist for your revised thesis:
- Answers the prompt (extent of agreement/disagreement).
- States a clear stance (e.g., partly agree) and shows relative weight (primarily… secondarily…).
- Previews your two main points (political/civic influence as primary; personal/consumer actions as secondary).
- Uses confident, precise language (no “I think,” “maybe,” or long hedging).

Phrase bank you can use (mix and match—no need to use all):
- Stance: “I partly agree,” “to a considerable extent,” “I contend,” “I argue”
- Comparison: “compared to government and corporate interventions,” “relative to systemic measures”
- Primary mechanism: “through civic pressure and collective political participation,” “by shaping policy via voting, advocacy, and protest”
- Secondary mechanism: “through household behaviors and consumer choices that signal market demand”
- Weighting/linking: “primarily… while secondarily…,” “chiefly… yet also…,” “although less impactful… still…”
- Limitation: “limited in scale,” “constrained by reach,” “smaller marginal impact”

If helpful, build your sentence using this skeleton (fill each bracket with your own words):
[Stance + comparison] + [primary mechanism/outcome] + [secondary mechanism + brief limitation].

Please post your revised thesis now. Are you satisfied with it? If yes, we’ll move to Step 2 and you’ll choose one body paragraph for us to revise its topic sentence. If not, tell me what feels off, and I’ll suggest tiny edits (word swaps or structure tweaks) to strengthen it.

*Time:* 2025-11-20T13:18:41.759Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on
bla bla bla ...

*Time:* 2025-11-20T13:23:31.214Z

**Assistant:** I’m excited to help you revise—but we can’t skip Step 1. The thesis is mandatory before we move on. Please write your own revised one-sentence thesis now.

Quick checklist (aim for all four):
- Answers the prompt (extent: agree/disagree and how much).
- Previews your two main points (primary: civic/political influence; secondary: personal/consumer actions).
- Signals relative weight (primarily… secondarily…).
- Uses confident, precise language (no “I think,” “maybe”).

Build-it skeleton (fill the brackets in your own words):
[extent of agreement + comparison to governments/corporations], primarily because [individuals’ greatest impact comes through civic pressure/collective political participation that shapes policy], while [household behaviors/consumer choices] [contribute by signaling demand] but [are limited by scale].

Phrase bank (mix and match—no need to use all):
- Extent: “I partly agree,” “to a considerable extent,” “I agree that individual actions are smaller in impact…”
- Comparison: “relative to systemic measures,” “compared with policy and corporate interventions”
- Primary mechanism: “civic pressure,” “collective political participation,” “voting, advocacy, protest shaping policy”
- Secondary mechanism: “household behaviors,” “consumer choices,” “market signals”
- Weighting/limits: “primarily… while secondarily…,” “supporting role,” “limited in scale/reach”

Please post your revised thesis (one sentence) in your own words. Are you satisfied with it? Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 2 and you’ll choose one body paragraph for us to revise its topic sentence.

*Time:* 2025-11-20T13:24:03.671Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentence and move on bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-11-20T13:41:07.500Z

**Assistant:** Great to work with you. We’ll move step by step and keep it focused. First, we must complete Step 1 (thesis) before anything else.

Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision
1) Please confirm your current thesis. I see this as your thesis:
“...I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”

2) Feedback on clarity, strength, and focus:
- Clarity: Your stance (partial agreement) and two main points (civic influence; personal habits) are clear.
- Strength: The tone can be more confident. Reduce hedging (“I believe,” “I think”) and tighten the structure.
- Focus/preview: Signal the relative weight (primary vs. secondary) and use precise terms (e.g., “collective political engagement,” “household behaviors,” “market signals”).
- Concision: Aim for one crisp sentence that answers “to what extent” and previews the essay’s structure.

3) Phrase bank (mix-and-match; use only what helps you):
- Stance: “I partly agree…,” “To a considerable extent, I agree…,” “I contend that…”
- Comparison: “relative to government and corporate measures,” “compared with systemic interventions”
- Primary mechanism: “through civic pressure and collective political participation that shapes policy,” “by voting, advocacy, and protest”
- Secondary mechanism: “through household behaviors and consumer choices that signal demand,” “limited in scale”
- Weighting/linking: “primarily…, while secondarily…,” “chiefly…, yet also…”

4) Build-it skeleton (please fill in with your own words):
[extent of agreement + comparison to governments/corporations], primarily because [individuals’ greatest impact comes through civic/political action that shapes policy], while [household behaviors/consumer choices] [support change by signaling demand] but [are limited in scale].

Would you write your revised one-sentence thesis now? Are you satisfied with it? Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 2 and you’ll pick one body paragraph for us to revise its topic sentence.

Tip for the AI-Assisted Review rubric: Feel free to ask me questions about word choice or structure and explain why you accept or reject a suggestion—that will strengthen your “Critical Review” and “Refining Process” scores.

*Time:* 2025-11-20T13:41:35.738Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1 
 bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-11-20T13:43:44.469Z

**Assistant:** ⚠️ Error connecting to server.

*Time:* 2025-11-20T13:44:57.926Z

**You:** ok let’s revise the rest of the body paragraph 
#1 bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-11-20T14:15:12.013Z

**Assistant:** I’m glad you’re ready to revise—but we need to follow the three-step process. We can’t revise the rest of body paragraph #1 until we complete Step 1 (thesis) and Step 2 (that paragraph’s topic sentence).

Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision
Your current thesis (from the original draft) is: “I partly agree… citizens can still influence the government… personal green lifestyle choices… have a role to play.”

Quick feedback:
- Clarity: Your stance (partial agreement) and two main points are clear. Good start.
- Strength: Reduce hedging (“I believe,” “I think”). Aim for one concise, confident sentence.
- Focus/preview: Signal the primary mechanism (civic/political influence) and the secondary mechanism (household/consumer actions) and show their relative weight.

Tiny word swaps and building blocks (use what fits your style):
- Stance: “I partly agree,” “To a considerable extent, I agree,” “I contend”
- Comparison: “relative to government and corporate measures,” “compared with systemic interventions”
- Primary mechanism: “through civic pressure and collective political participation that shapes policy”
- Secondary mechanism: “through household behaviors and consumer choices that signal market demand”
- Weighting: “primarily… while secondarily…,” “chiefly… yet also…,” “although less impactful… still…”

Skeleton (please fill with your own words; keep it one sentence):
[extent of agreement + comparison], primarily because [individuals’ greatest impact is through civic/political action that shapes policy], while [household/consumer actions] [support change by signaling demand] but [are limited in scale].

Would you write your revised one-sentence thesis now? Are you satisfied with it? Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 2.

Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision (for Body Paragraph #1)
You’ve chosen paragraph #1. Please paste its current topic sentence. We’ll make sure it clearly connects to your revised thesis and signals this paragraph’s focus (individuals’ primary impact via civic/political influence).

Helpful prompts for the topic sentence (not full sentences—mix and match):
- Focus terms: “collective political engagement,” “civic pressure,” “policy change,” “institutional action”
- Link to thesis: “As the primary channel of impact…,” “Chiefly, individuals matter when…”
- Scope cue: “at the policy level,” “through voting, advocacy, and protest”

Once you revise the topic sentence and you’re happy with it, we’ll proceed to Step 3 and refine the rest of paragraph #1 for clarity, unity, and coherence.

Your move:
1) Post your revised thesis (one sentence) and confirm you’re satisfied.
2) Paste paragraph #1’s current topic sentence so we can revise it next.

Tip for your AI-Assisted Review score: Tell me briefly why you accept or reject any of the word choices above. That critical reasoning will help your rubric.
