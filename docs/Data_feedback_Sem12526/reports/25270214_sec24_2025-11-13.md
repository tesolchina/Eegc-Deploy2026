            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your training assessment report and chat history. It appears the main barrier to progress in the module is that the student did not take the opportunity to revise their thesis statement or engage further with the AI’s suggestions after identifying the original thesis.

To help the student move forward, here are some specific tips you might share with them, if appropriate:

- After locating the thesis, try writing a clearer, more confident version that previews your two main points.  
- Use the AI’s example as a model, but put the ideas in your own words.  
- Don’t hesitate to ask the AI for help if you’re unsure how to improve a sentence or need examples.  
- Respond actively to AI feedback; for example, after rewriting, copy your new thesis so the AI can review it again.  
- Pay attention to grammar and transition improvements too — revision is about more than just content.

If you’d like, I can also help draft a revised thesis statement based on the original and AI guidance, to demonstrate a model revision for the student. Would you find that useful?

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 – The essay presents two clear main ideas (government influence and personal choices), and demonstrates adequate awareness of climate change issues. Expression of viewpoint is evident but could be strengthened for clarity.

- Vocabulary: 18/25 – Vocabulary is generally appropriate, with some topic-specific terms (“green lifestyle”, “carbon emissions”). Some repetitive phrasing and simplistic expressions.
- Grammar: 17/25 – Simple sentence structures, with occasional errors (“so is not always working well”). These errors sometimes affect clarity but do not prevent understanding.
- **Original Essay Total: 75/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 – No substantive changes; content remains the same as the original. Two main ideas are still present, with similar development.
- Organization: 19/25 – Structure and progression identical to the original; no organizational changes.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 – No significant vocabulary changes.

- **In-Depth Conversation:** 2/5 – The chat included some feedback and a prompt for revision, but student participation was minimal and did not go beyond identifying the thesis statement.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions:** 1/5 – The student did not engage with AI suggestions, nor did they provide any evidence of evaluating or critiquing proposals.
- **Refining Process:** 1/5 – There is no evidence of an iterative revision process or meaningful editing based on AI feedback.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 4/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Located thesis statement when prompted.
- Engaged initially with the AI’s step-by-step instructions.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- **Revision Completion:** Did not revise thesis statement, topic sentence, or body paragraph as required.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-13T03:21:23.653Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T03:23:59.745Z

**Assistant:** Great, thanks for sharing your current thesis statement:

**“I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”**

Let’s work on this step-by-step!

**Step 1 – Thesis Statement Revision**

### My Feedback for Your Thesis Statement:

**Positives:**
- You show a clear viewpoint (“I partly agree”).
- You mention two main ideas: citizens’ influence on government, and personal green lifestyle choices.

**Suggestions:**
- Try to make your thesis statement more direct and confident (avoid phrases like “I think” or “I also think”).
- Clearly mention the structure: let the reader know both **government influence** and **personal choices** will be discussed.
- Use precise language (“role to play” can be more specific).

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does your thesis directly answer the essay prompt? (Should individuals act, or is government/corporate action more important?)
- Can it preview your two main points?
- Is the language confident?

**Example of the kind of improvement you might try (just to guide, not copy!):**
- Individuals have a crucial role in fighting climate change by influencing government policies and adopting sustainable personal habits, even though larger-scale change depends on political and business leaders.

Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now, using these suggestions? If you rewrite it, please share, and I’ll give further feedback!
