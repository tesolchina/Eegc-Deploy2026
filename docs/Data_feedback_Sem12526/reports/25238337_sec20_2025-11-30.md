            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for sharing your revised overview and body paragraphs. You’ve made solid progress! A few points to strengthen your work further:

**Overview and comparative phrasing:**
- Good job stating the global average (18%) and giving examples at the high (Hong Kong ~30%) and low (India ~12%) ends.
- To fix the comparative phrase “two-thirds higher than the global average” (which is mathematically inaccurate), you could say:
  - “...other developed countries, such as the UK, US, Singapore, Japan, and Israel, are all around 25%, which is about 7 percentage points higher — roughly 40% higher — than the global average.”
- For the difference between Hong Kong (30%) and India (12%), “the difference is over 18 percentage points” is clearer than just “over 18%.” You might also add that Hong Kong’s exposure is more than twice India’s (which is accurate).

**Organization and topic sentences:**
- Your paragraphs are organized by developed markets first, then emerging markets, which is clear.
- To improve paragraph unity, you can explicitly link topic sentences to the overview’s main point. For example:
  - Developed markets paragraph topic sentence: “Developed markets generally show higher exposure to AI automation than the global average.”
  - Emerging markets paragraph topic sentence: “In contrast, emerging markets tend to have lower exposure than the global average.”

**Grammar and clarity:**
- Watch small issues like “The chat shows” → “The chart shows” (you fixed this well).
- Use consistent singular/plural forms, e.g., “percentages higher than” not “percent higher than.”
- Double-check prepositions and articles: “around 30%,” “at only 12%,” “differs by over 18 percentage points.”

**Suggestion for a concluding sentence:**
- Add a brief conclusion to reinforce the main trend and close your description smoothly, e.g.,  
  “Overall, developed markets tend to have greater AI exposure in employment compared to emerging markets, with significant variation between countries.”

If you’d like, you can revise your overview and one chosen body paragraph using these suggestions, then share your update. I’ll be happy to review and help you polish further! Would you prefer to start with the developed or emerging markets paragraph?

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The original includes relevant data and comparisons (e.g., recognises Hong Kong as high and India as low) but the main pattern is not clearly synthesized and phrasing is sometimes confusing. Example: "From the chart, we can see that the share of full-time equivalent employment exposed by AI of global is around 18%." (unclear wording).
- Organization: 15/25 - Paragraphing exists but sentences are repetitive and some comparisons are disorganized; transitions and logical flow need work. Example run-on: "Compare the highest-use city Hong Kong to the lowest-use country India, the difference between them are over 15%..."
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Vocabulary is serviceable but imprecise and repetitive ("use," "percent," "high-developed"); some misspellings ("Isreal").
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 15/25 - Frequent grammar errors (articles, subject-verb agreement, plurals, punctuation) that reduce clarity: e.g., "most of countries’ percent" and "in India, is only 12% EM".
- **Original Essay Total: 63/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised text adds a clearer overview and more explicit comparisons (global average ~18%; Hong Kong ≈30% highest; India ≈12% lowest). This improves task-focus and idea development. One factual/phrasing issue remains: the claim "which is about two-thirds higher than the global average" for 25% vs 18% is inaccurate and should be corrected to avoid misleading relative comparisons.
- Organization: 21/25 - Revision separates the overview and two comparison paragraphs, improving logical progression (overview → developed markets → emerging markets). Paragraph unity and ordering are clearer.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Word choice is improved and more precise overall, with academic phrasing ("global average," "in contrast"). Some repetitive wording and a misleading comparative phrase (see above) remain.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 21/25 - Many grammar issues from the original have been fixed; sentences are clearer and punctuation is better. A few phrasing and comparative-accuracy issues remain (e.g., "which is about two-thirds higher than the global average" is mathematically imprecise).
- **Revised Essay Total: 83/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +20 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Added a clear overview/thesis and gave the global average upfront ("The global average for full-time equivalent employment exposed by AI is about 18%.").
  - Reorganized content into two distinct supporting paragraphs (developed markets, emerging markets), improving logical flow.
  - Corrected many grammar and clarity problems (cleaner sentences, fixed most misspellings, clearer punctuation).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Ensure numerical/comparative accuracy: avoid imprecise relative phrases (e.g., "two-thirds higher" for 25% vs 18% is incorrect). Use percentage-point differences or correct relative percentages.
  - Strengthen cohesion with clearer topic sentences tied directly to the overview (topic sentences could explicitly reference developed vs emerging markets).
  - Add a brief concluding remark or one-sentence summary to close the description and reinforce the main trend.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9** (assistant and user turns combined)
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant used a structured coaching approach (diagnosis, suggested targets, stepwise plan). The student engaged, selected priorities (overview/thesis, a supporting paragraph, and grammar), and posted a revised essay. The interaction shows guided revision with one clear revision cycle.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Developing. The conversation is focused and substantive (the assistant provided detailed diagnostic feedback and a clear plan). However, the number of exchanges is moderate (9 turns), short of the extensive multi-cycle conversations (15+) that indicate in-depth development.
  - Evidence: assistant laid out a three-step process and diagnostic feedback; student chose targets and supplied a revised version.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 - Developing. The student accepted and followed the assistant’s suggestions (chose targets, revised the overview and paragraphs) but shows little explicit evaluation or rejection of AI suggestions in the chat. There is acceptance and action, but not much evidence of independent critical justification for choices.
  - Evidence: Student responded "focus on the overview/thesis..." and then pasted the revised draft; no documented instances of the student challenging or debating specific suggestions.
- **Refining Process**: 3/5 - Developing. There was a clear revision cycle (assistant guidance → student revision) but only one substantial iteration. More back-and-forth edits and micro-revisions would demonstrate stronger iterative refinement.
  - Evidence: assistant asked for revised overview/topic paragraph and the student provided the revised text; additional rounds of editing were not shown.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 9/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student followed a structured revision plan and implemented the recommended changes (evidence: posted a clearer overview and separated comparison paragraphs).
- Improved clarity and grammar overall (revised essay shows more readable sentences and corrected punctuation/spelling).
- Task focus is correct: the student clarified that the work was the chart description and revised accordingly.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Comparative accuracy: revise comparative language to be numerically precise (use percentage-point difference or correct relative percent). Example to fix: replace "which is about two-thirds higher than the global average" with "about 7 percentage points higher (≈39% higher relative to 18%)."
- Critical engagement with AI suggestions: explicitly evaluate AI recommendations (accept, modify, or reject with reasons) in the chat to show stronger metacognitive control.
- Iteration depth: perform additional revision cycles (e.g., rewrite topic sentences again, tighten transitions, add a one-sentence conclusion), ideally documented in chat.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student clarified which assignment to work on (chart description) and provided the original draft for context.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student selected focused revision targets (overview, paragraph, grammar) as recommended.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student accepted suggestions and revised accordingly but did not document critical analysis or selective rejection of AI suggestions.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The student implemented changes independently (produced a revised essay), but further independent checking for numerical phrasing and precision is needed.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Check numerical comparisons carefully: when comparing percentages, state either the difference in percentage points or the correct relative percentage (and avoid casual relative phrases that may be misleading).
2. Practice an explicit critical-review step in the chat: after the assistant suggests changes, respond with brief evaluations (accept/modify/reject + reason) to show critical engagement.
3. Continue iterative revisions: after one revision, run a short follow-up round for tightening topic sentences, transitions, and a closing sentence to strengthen cohesion.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student clearly engaged with the AI coach and implemented substantive improvements. The remaining weaknesses are mainly in precise use of comparative language and deeper critical engagement in the collaborative process.
- Recommend encouraging the student to document one more revision cycle (student revises again after instructor/assistant micro-feedback) to consolidate gains and improve numerical precision.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
The chat shows the share of full-time equivalent employment exposed by AI automation in Emerging Market(EM) economies and Developed Market(DM) economies around the globe in 2023.

From the chart, we can see that the share of full-time equivalent employment exposed by AI of global is around 18%. However, most of countries’ percent are higher than global’s, such as Hong Kong, which has the highest percentage, around 30% of DM, is nearly a double of global’s, and some high-developed countries such as UK, US, Singapore, Japan and Isreal are all around 25% DM, which are two-third higher than global’s percentage.

Besides from these high use of AI automation countries, there are some countries still use less percentage of automation, such as Asia countries, like Mainland China, Thailand and Vietnam, only have around 14% EM, and in India, is only 12% EM, which is the lowest percent of use, it is around one-fourth lower than the global’s. Compare the highest-use city Hong Kong to the lowest-use country India, the difference between them are over 15%, which means that the percentage of Hong Kong is more than twice of the percentage of India.

Revised:
The chat shows the share of full-time equivalent employment exposed by AI automation in Emerging Market (EM) economies and Developed Market (DM) economies around the globe in 2023. The global average for full-time equivalent employment exposed by AI is about 18%. However, many countries have percentages higher than this average. For example, Hong Kong has the highest percentage among developed markets at around 30%, nearly double the global average. Other developed countries, such as the UK, US, Singapore, Japan, and Israel, are all around 25%, which is about two-thirds higher than the global average.
In contrast, several emerging markets have lower percentages of exposure to AI automation. Countries like Mainland China, Thailand, and Vietnam report around 14%, while India has the lowest exposure at only 12%, about one-fourth lower than the global average. When comparing the highest-use region, Hong Kong, to the lowest-use country, India, the difference is over 18%, indicating that Hong Kong’s percentage is more than twice that of India.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-30T06:52:40.517Z

**You:** what should I correct and improve

*Time:* 2025-11-30T06:58:05.289Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a good place to start. Before I give detailed fixes, let’s negotiate clear targets so our revision time is focused and useful.

1) Quick check: which task do you want to work on today?
- The climate-change opinion essay prompt (Some people believe that individual actions are insignificant…)? 
- Or the chart description you pasted (AI automation exposure by country in 2023)?
I ask because your draft is a data-description about AI, but the “Current Topic” above is a climate-change prompt. Which one should I help you revise?

2) What are your personal goals for this session? (Choose up to 2–3)
- Improve clarity and overall organization (structure, logical flow)
- Strengthen the main idea / thesis / overview
- Improve topic sentences and paragraph unity
- Fix grammar and sentence structure (articles, verb forms, punctuation)
- Improve vocabulary precision and word choice
- Improve data description accuracy and comparisons (for chart task)
- Improve task-focus and relevance to the prompt (for the climate essay)

Tell me which task (chart or climate essay) and which 1–3 targets you want to focus on. Then I’ll give a short diagnosis using the rubric and we’ll pick the priorities to work through the three-step revision process.

Brief diagnostic feedback (quick, based on your current draft)
- Strengths
  - You include relevant data comparisons and try to highlight highest and lowest figures.
  - You attempt comparison language (higher, lower, twice, etc.), which is essential for a chart description.
  - You give some specific country examples (Hong Kong, India, UK, US, etc.), which helps support the overview.

- Main areas to improve (mapped to the rubric)
  - Content and Ideas: Developing/Basic. The ideas are relevant but a bit unclear and sometimes inaccurate in wording (e.g., “Isreal,” “global’s,” “only have around 14% EM”). Needs a clear overview sentence that synthesizes the main trend.
  - Organisation and Logical Progression: Developing. The paragraphing is present but sentences are repetitive and sometimes disjointed. The flow (overview → comparisons → details) should be clearer.
  - Vocabulary: Basic to Developing. Repetitive words (percent, use, higher) and imprecise phrasing (“high-developed,” “most of countries’ percent”). Use more precise academic language (e.g., “the majority of countries exceed the global average”).
  - Grammar and Sentence Structure: Basic. Problems with articles, plural/singular agreement, prepositions, word order, punctuation, and some run-on/awkward sentences. Example issues: “From the chart, we can see that the share … of global is around 18%.” “Compare the highest-use city Hong Kong to the lowest-use country India, the difference between them are over 15%.”
  - Task fit (important): If the assignment is the climate-change essay, this draft does not address the prompt. If the assignment is the chart description, it’s on topic but needs clearer overview and more precise comparisons.

Some specific things to fix (I’ll help you with these once you pick targets)
- Create a clear overview (thesis/summary) that states the main pattern(s) in 1–2 sentences.
- Correct grammar errors: subject-verb agreement, articles (“the global share”), plurals, prepositions.
- Improve comparison language and numerical accuracy (e.g., “about 30% — nearly double the global average of 18%”).
- Rework awkward sentences into shorter, clearer sentences.
- Fix names and spelling (Israel) and phrasing (use “developed economies” rather than “high-developed”).

Next step
Please tell me:
1. Which task do you want to revise (chart description or climate-change essay)?
2. Which 1–3 targets from the list above should we focus on now?

Once you confirm, we’ll begin Step 1: revise the thesis/overview sentence. I’ll ask you to share the current thesis/overview (your first 1–2 sentences) and then guide you to rewrite it. Would you like to proceed?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T06:58:18.775Z

**You:** the chart description I pasted

*Time:* 2025-11-30T07:00:45.021Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming. We'll work on the chart description you pasted.

First, quick check before we begin: pick 1–3 targets you want us to focus on in this session (choose from these or add your own):
- Create a clear, concise overview/thesis for the chart (best single priority for this task)
- Improve overall organization and logical flow (overview → main comparisons → details)
- Improve data-description accuracy and comparison language (percentages, “double”, “higher than”)
- Fix grammar and sentence structure (articles, subject-verb agreement, punctuation)
- Improve vocabulary precision and word choice (avoid repetition, use academic phrasing)

My recommendation: focus on the overview/thesis, one supporting paragraph (organization/flow), and grammar — but choose what matters most to you.

Brief diagnostic feedback (short, tied to the rubric)
- Content & Ideas: Relevant data and comparisons are present but the main pattern is not stated clearly in a concise overview.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Information is mostly in one paragraph with some repetition and unclear ordering of comparisons.
- Vocabulary: Repetitive and sometimes imprecise (e.g., “most of countries’ percent,” “high-developed”).
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Frequent errors (articles, plurals, verb forms, run-on sentences) that reduce clarity.
- Data accuracy: Comparisons are useful but need clearer phrasing and exact relationships (e.g., “nearly double” vs. “about 1.7 times”).

Now you decide:
1) Which 1–3 targets from the list above do you want to focus on?
2) Confirm and then we’ll begin Step 1: thesis/overview revision.

Step 1 instructions (what will happen once you confirm)
- Share the current overview/thesis you want to revise (you can paste your opening 1–2 sentences — the ones you already have are fine).
- I’ll give brief feedback on clarity, strength, and focus (3 quick points).
- I’ll encourage you to try rewriting the overview. I’ll give short phrase suggestions and one model fragment if needed, but I won’t write the full sentence for you unless you ask me to rewrite the essay later.
- When you’re happy with the revised overview, we’ll move to Step 2 (choose one body paragraph to work on).

Would you like to proceed? Which targets do you choose?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T07:00:58.466Z

**You:** focus on the overview/thesis, one supporting paragraph (organization/flow), and grammar

*Time:* 2025-11-30T07:02:17.974Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming your targets: overview/thesis, one supporting paragraph (organization/flow), and grammar. That’s a strong, focused plan.

Quick diagnostic summary (very brief, tied to the rubric)
- Content & Ideas: Relevant data included but the main pattern isn’t stated clearly in a concise overview.
- Organisation & Flow: Ideas are in the right order (overview → comparisons → details) but sentences repeat and some comparisons are unclear.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Frequent errors (articles, plurals, verb forms, punctuation) that reduce clarity.

Step 1 — Thesis/Overview revision
Please paste the one or two opening sentences you want to revise (you can paste your current opening; I can use that). I see these as your current overview:
"The chat shows the share of full-time equivalent employment exposed by AI automation in Emerging Market(EM) economies and Developed Market(DM) economies around the globe in 2023.
From the chart, we can see that the share of full-time equivalent employment exposed by AI of global is around 18%."

Quick feedback on that draft (three short points)
1. Clarity: It states the topic but doesn’t summarize the main pattern (e.g., whether developed markets are generally higher than emerging markets).
2. Precision: Numbers are listed but phrasing is awkward (e.g., “share … of global is around 18%” — better: “the global average is about 18%”).
3. Economy: Make the overview one concise sentence that highlights the main trend and mentions notable extremes (highest and lowest) if space allows.

Helpful phrases and one short model fragment to guide you
- Useful phrases: “Overall,” “the global average,” “developed markets generally show…,” “emerging markets tend to…,” “notably,” “the highest/lowest exposure is…”
- Model fragment (use as a guide — try to write your own first):
  Overall, developed markets generally show higher exposure to AI automation than emerging markets, with a global average of about 18% (Hong Kong ≈30% is the highest, while India ≈12% is the lowest).

Would you like to try rewriting the overview now? Paste your revised 1–2 sentences and I’ll give quick feedback and suggestions. After you’re happy with the overview, tell me which body paragraph you want to revise (for example: the paragraph that compares high-use countries like Hong Kong and the UK to low-use countries like India), and paste that paragraph for Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T07:02:31.204Z

**You:** The chat shows the share of full-time equivalent employment exposed by AI automation in Emerging Market (EM) economies and Developed Market (DM) economies around the globe in 2023. The global average for full-time equivalent employment exposed by AI is about 18%. However, many countries have percentages higher than this average. For example, Hong Kong has the highest percentage among developed markets at around 30%, nearly double the global average. Other developed countries, such as the UK, US, Singapore, Japan, and Israel, are all around 25%, which is about two-thirds higher than the global average.

In contrast, several emerging markets have lower percentages of exposure to AI automation. Countries like Mainland China, Thailand, and Vietnam report around 14%, while India has the lowest exposure at only 12%, about one-fourth lower than the global average. When comparing the highest-use region, Hong Kong, to the lowest-use country, India, the difference is over 18%, indicating that Hong Kong's percentage is more than twice that of India.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T07:08:24.942Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — you’ve already made useful improvements. Before we begin the three-step revision, let’s confirm the plan so our time is focused.

1) Confirming targets
- You said you want to focus on: (a) a clear overview/thesis for the chart, (b) one supporting paragraph’s organization/flow, and (c) grammar. Is that still correct? Reply “yes” (or adjust).

2) Which paragraph to revise in Steps 2–3?
- You have two short body paragraphs. Which would you like us to work on: the paragraph about developed markets (Hong Kong, UK, US, etc.) or the paragraph about emerging markets (China, Thailand, Vietnam, India) and the comparison to Hong Kong? (Pick one.)

Step 1 — Thesis/Overview revision
Please paste or confirm the one- or two-sentence overview you want to revise. I see this as your current overview:
"The chart shows the share of full-time equivalent employment exposed by AI automation in Emerging Market (EM) economies and Developed Market (DM) economies around the globe in 2023. The global average for full-time equivalent employment exposed by AI is about 18%."

Brief feedback (three quick points)
1. Clarity: This states the topic and the global average, but it doesn’t summarize the main pattern. A strong overview should say the main trend in one concise sentence (e.g., which group tends to have higher exposure) and, if possible, mention notable extremes.
2. Precision: Fix small wording errors — e.g., chart (not chat), “global average is about 18%” is fine, but avoid expressions like “two‑third higher” elsewhere: use percentage points or relative phrasing clearly (e.g., “about 7 percentage points higher” or “about 40% higher”).
3. Economy: Combine the two sentences into one clear overview that previews the later comparisons (developed vs. emerging; highest and lowest examples).

Useful phrases you can use in your rewrite
- “Overall,” “In general,” “The chart indicates that…”
- “developed markets generally show higher exposure than emerging markets”
- “the global average is about 18%”
- “notably, Hong Kong (≈30%) has the highest exposure while India (≈12%) has the lowest”

Try rewriting the overview now (one sentence is best). Would you like to:
A) Try rewriting it yourself and paste your version, or
B) Ask me to give a short model sentence to help you?

After you post your revised overview and confirm you’re happy with it, we’ll move to Step 2: you’ll tell me which body paragraph to work on (or paste the paragraph), and we’ll revise its topic sentence to connect to the new overview. Would you like to proceed?
