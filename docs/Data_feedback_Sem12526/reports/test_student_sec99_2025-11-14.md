            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing the final assessment report and chat history. Given the current status, here are a few suggestions you might consider to help the student move forward effectively:

1. **Encourage Submission of Substantive Drafts:**  
   Clearly communicate the importance of submitting a full essay draft rather than placeholders, so the AI and instructor can provide meaningful feedback.

2. **Prompt Engagement with the AI:**  
   Recommend that the student actively participates, responding to the AI’s questions and choosing revision focus areas, to benefit from the structured revision process.

3. **Clarify Module Expectations:**  
   Reinforce the three-step revision process (thesis statement, topic sentence, body paragraph) and explain how fulfilling each step aids writing skills development.

4. **Offer Support and Motivation:**  
   Reach out personally or through the platform to check if the student faces any challenges (time, understanding, technical issues) and offer additional guidance or resources.

If you’d like, I can help you draft a follow-up message or a plan to encourage better student interaction and completion. Would that be useful?

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪
