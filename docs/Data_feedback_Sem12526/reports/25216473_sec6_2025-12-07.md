# Final Assessment Report

## Student Assessment Report  
**Course:** LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship  
**Module:** AI for Revising Essays  

### Essay Writing Assessment

#### Original Essay Scores Summary:
- **Content and Ideas:** The essay addresses AI and jobs but does not respond to the assigned climate change prompt. The stance is vague and unsupported by developed evidence.
- **Organization:** Presented as three paragraphs but lacking clear topic sentences and logical progression; ideas are repetitive with weak transitions.
- **Vocabulary:** Basic with frequent incorrect collocations and forms.
- **Grammar:** Frequent errors that often obscure meaning.
- **Overall Original Essay:** Contains multiple fundamental issues impacting clarity and relevance.

#### Revised Essay Scores Summary:
- The revised essay is identical to the original; no revisions were made to content, organization, vocabulary, or grammar.
- No improvement demonstrated in responding to feedback or the assignment prompt.

---

### Essay Improvement Analysis

- **Improvement:** No improvement shown; the revised draft is unchanged.
- **Key Issues Missed:**
  - The essay topic remains unrelated to the climate change prompt.
  - No rewritten thesis or topic sentences were attempted.
  - No paragraph-level revision or correction of grammar and vocabulary errors.
  - No evidence of iterative editing or engagement with assistant guidance.

---

### Human-AI Interaction Assessment

#### Chat History Analysis:
- The assistant provided detailed, structured guidance and multiple revision templates for thesis and paragraphs.
- The student’s chat contributions were brief commands without substantive attempts at rewriting or providing feedback.
- No student-generated revised sentences were posted, resulting in a lack of visible iterative collaboration.
- The student did not explicitly choose the assignment topic (climate vs AI), nor did they articulate a thesis stance.
- The conversation shows some engagement but lacks depth, critical evaluation, or independent editing.

#### Interaction Scores (Qualitative):
- **In-Depth Conversation:** Moderate, due to multiple turns; limited by student’s brief responses.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions:** Low, no visible evaluation or selective revision by student.
- **Refining Process:** Low, no iterative drafts or edits visible.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total:** Needs significant improvement.

---

### Overall Performance Summary

#### Strengths:
- The student attempted to engage by responding to revision prompts with commands.
- The original draft contains concrete ideas that could be further developed.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Provide explicit, rewritten text in chat — thesis sentence, topic sentences, and revised paragraphs.
- Clearly align the essay content with the assigned prompt or explicitly state the choice to switch prompts.
- Use provided templates and feedback to craft a clear, argumentative thesis.
- Revise paragraphs thoughtfully with improved grammar, vocabulary, and organization.
- Demonstrate critical engagement by evaluating and adapting assistant suggestions.

---

### Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Complete the Revision Cycle:** Submit rewritten thesis sentence, at least one revised topic sentence, and an improved body paragraph for review.
2. **Clarify the Assignment Focus:** Choose whether to write on the climate change prompt or on AI and jobs; clearly communicate this choice.
3. **Use Templates:** Apply provided thesis and topic sentence templates to build clarity and logical progression.
4. **Focus on Language Accuracy:** Perform line-by-line correction for grammar and vocabulary.
5. **Collaborate Actively:** Post drafts in chat for iterative feedback and refinement.
6. **Engage Critically:** Evaluate suggestions, state preferences, and attempt independent editing.

---

### Instructor Notes:

- The lack of textual revision means the assignment requirements were not met.
- The student showed willingness to participate but needs to move beyond brief commands to substantive editing.
- For formative credit, require submission of:
  - A clear, single thesis statement aligned with the prompt.
  - One improved topic sentence.
  - One revised body paragraph exhibiting grammar and coherence improvement.
- Encourage the student to explicitly choose topic focus and stance early in revision.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 12/25 - The draft presents an attempted pro/con position about AI and jobs, but ideas are underdeveloped and off-task (the assignment prompt is about climate change). Thesis is vague: “Therefore, I think it is both have good things and bad things. Let me talk about this.” Evidence is scant and examples are poorly developed.
- Organization: 12/25 - There is a three-paragraph shape, but paragraphs lack clear topic sentences and logical progression. Sentences repeat ideas (“Automation can increase dramatically the production”) and transitions are weak.
- Vocabulary: 11/25 - Vocabulary is limited and contains many incorrect collocations and word forms (e.g., “manufactured more efficiency,” “employment was fell,” “With advance of technological”).
- Grammar: 10/25 - Frequent grammatical errors (articles, verb forms, word order, tense) that often impede clarity (e.g., “It led the company manufactured more efficiency,” “Everyone can use AI do anything”).
- **Original Essay Total: 45/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 12/25 - The revised essay is identical to the original and therefore shows no content improvement; still off-topic relative to the climate prompt and still vague in argument.
- Organization: 12/25 - No structural changes; same weak paragraph development and lack of clear topic sentences in the revised version.
- Vocabulary: 11/25 - Same limited and incorrect word choices remain; no evident vocabulary enhancement.
- Grammar: 10/25 - No correction of recurring grammatical errors; sentence-level problems persist.
- **Revised Essay Total: 45/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None — the revised essay is identical to the original; no demonstrable textual revisions were made.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Align content to the assigned prompt (essay discusses AI and jobs while the prompt expects a response about climate change and individual vs institutional action).
  - Rewrite the thesis into a clear stance that previews supporting points (e.g., use the assistant’s suggested template).
  - Revise at least one topic sentence and one body paragraph for clarity, coherence, and grammatical accuracy.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9 messages** (assistant messages with detailed guidance and 4 brief user replies such as “Let’s revise thesis statement”, “Let’s revise topic sentences”, “Let’s revise one body language”, “Let’s revise the rest of the essay”). The assistant provided multiple diagnostic prompts and a clear 3-step revision plan; the student did not supply rewritten sentences or accept/critique suggestions in substantive form.
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant led a structured, helpful revision process and gave clear templates and stepwise instructions. The student’s contributions were brief commands rather than substantive responses or edits; the chat lacks evidence of iterative revision (no student-generated rewritten thesis, topic sentence, or paragraph appears).

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Developing. The chat shows multiple turns and detailed assistant guidance, but the total number of exchanges is modest and the student’s responses are minimal; there is some engagement but not deep iterative work.
  - Evidence: assistant provided step-by-step tasks and templates across many messages; student only replied with brief requests (e.g., “Let’s revise thesis statement”) and did not produce drafts in chat.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - Basic. The student did not demonstrate critical evaluation of suggestions or justify choices; responses were acceptance-style commands without evidence of reasoning or selective acceptance/rejection.
  - Evidence: the assistant asked the student to choose targets and write a thesis sentence; the student did not supply a thesis or comment on suggestions.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - Basic. There is no clear iterative revision cycle visible: the assistant laid out a 3-step revision plan, but the student did not complete the steps or show multiple revision rounds.
  - Evidence: the assistant requested a one-sentence thesis and a paragraph choice several times; the chat ends with the student asking to “Let’s revise the rest of the essay” but no revised text is provided.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student attempted to engage: multiple short directives show willingness to work with the assistant (“Let’s revise thesis statement”, “Let’s revise topic sentences”, etc.).
- The original draft includes some concrete ideas that could be developed (e.g., machines working 24 hours, cost savings), which the assistant correctly identified as developable evidence.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Provide actual revised text in the chat (rewritten thesis sentence, topic sentence, and paragraph) instead of only commands — this is required to demonstrate revision and collaboration.
- Align the essay content with the assignment prompt (switch content to address climate change and the relative weight of individual vs institutional actions, or explicitly choose a different prompt and state that choice).
- Focus on sentence-level corrections: rewrite the thesis and topic sentences using the assistant’s templates, then correct grammar and vocabulary errors line by line.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student did not provide choice of prompt (climate vs AI) or explicit stance; failed to answer the assistant’s crucial questions required to proceed.
  - Evidence: assistant repeatedly asked whether to keep the climate prompt or change to AI; the student never chose.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The assistant provided a clear plan; the student did not execute or refine it with concrete inputs.
  - Evidence: no student-produced thesis or paragraph edits despite the plan.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student did not accept, reject, or modify the assistant’s suggestions with reasoning.
  - Evidence: no engagement with specific suggestions or templates in the chat.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - No example of independent rewriting or editing was supplied by the student in chat.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Complete the assistant’s 3-step revision process by pasting your rewritten thesis sentence, then a revised topic sentence, then the edited paragraph into the chat so the assistant and assessor can evaluate real changes.
2. Decide and state clearly whether you will (a) keep the original climate-change prompt and revise content accordingly, or (b) change the assignment to AI-and-jobs and state that explicitly. Work must match the chosen prompt.
3. Use the assistant’s thesis templates to produce one clear, single-sentence thesis that takes a stance and previews 2–3 supporting points; then post it for feedback. Follow by revising one paragraph line-by-line, focusing on grammar and precise vocabulary.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The revised essay file is identical to the original; required revision tasks (revised thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph) were not completed. Grade/feedback should reflect that the student did not submit the requested revisions.
- The student engaged verbally (short directives) but did not provide substantive revision text in chat; encourage the student to post actual rewritten sentences and to explicitly choose the essay prompt alignment (climate vs AI).
- For formative credit, require the student to return with: a) a clear thesis sentence using the template, b) one improved topic sentence, and c) a revised body paragraph showing grammar and coherence improvements.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Nowadays with the advance of AI , automation is transforming industries ,potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. It led the company manufactured more efficiency.Meanwhile, employment was fell slightly in the following decade. Therefore, I think it is both have good things and bad things. Let me talk about this.

With advance of technological, it will shift ultimately enhance. In this 10 years AI is being normally . Everyone can use AI do anything .Many company using AI system to automation. For example
industries. Automation can increase dramatically the production. It can led a rise of change the production. Machine can work in 24 hours but human need a rest. It had a contrast between human and machine. Moreover, a cost of machine nearly a half of employee’s wages which can reduce the cost in production.

Overwise , it must undermine global employment prospects in the long term. With the advance of technology, many employee can’t find a job. In the following decade, AI will replace human. It is a serious problem in future. However, I don’t worried now. Because I think human and AI have difference here, AI can’t copy our emotional.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:46:56.303Z

**You:** Let’s revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:17:49.204Z

**Assistant:** Great — before we start revising the thesis, let’s do the short negotiation and diagnosis so we’re focused and make the most of this session.

1) Negotiating targets
- What would you most like to improve right now? (Choose up to two)
  - A. Clarity and strength of argument (thesis and topic sentences)
  - B. Organization and paragraph structure
  - C. Grammar and sentence accuracy
  - D. Vocabulary and word choice
  - E. Staying on topic / answering the question
Tell me which you want to focus on.

2) Quick diagnostic reading (based on the rubric)
- Content & Ideas: Your draft has some ideas about automation and AI’s effects on jobs (attempt at pros and cons). However, the essay prompt is about climate change and whether individual actions matter compared with governments and corporations. Right now your topic does not match the given question. Your viewpoint sentence is vague and underdeveloped.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Paragraphs lack clear topic sentences and logical flow. Ideas are repeated and there’s no clear preview of main points.
- Vocabulary: Vocabulary is basic and repetitive; there are also inaccurate word forms and collocations (e.g., “manufactured more efficiency,” “employment was fell”).
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Frequent grammar, tense, article, and word order errors make meaning unclear.
- Strengths: You attempt to present both sides (positive and negative). You have some concrete ideas (machines work 24 hours; cost savings) that could become evidence if focused.

3) Student priority selection
- From that diagnosis, which issues do you want to focus on in this session? (Please pick up to two — for example: “E (staying on topic) and A (thesis strength)” or “A and C”.)
- Important: before we rewrite the thesis, do you want to: 
  a) keep the climate change prompt (so we must change the essay content to discuss individuals vs governments/corporations on climate), or 
  b) change the assignment to be about AI and jobs (which would mean the prompt is different)?
Tell me which option you choose.

Once you confirm your priorities and whether we’re writing on climate change or AI, we’ll move to Step 1: thesis revision.

Step 1 (preview): About your current thesis
- Your current thesis sentence: “Therefore, I think it is both have good things and bad things. Let me talk about this.”
- Why it needs revision:
  - It is vague and doesn’t answer the essay question. The prompt asks “To what extent do you agree or disagree …” so the thesis must state a clear position (agree, disagree, partly agree) about the significance of individual actions in fighting climate change.
  - It doesn’t preview the main points you will use to support that position.
  - It uses hedging and awkward grammar.

Guidance to write a stronger thesis
- Use this simple template:
  - “I [agree/disagree/partly agree] that individual actions are [insignificant/significant] in the fight against climate change because [main reason 1], [main reason 2], and [main reason 3].”
- Or, if you prefer a two-part version:
  - “While [acknowledge the other side], I [position]. I will show this by discussing [point 1], [point 2], and [point 3].”

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using one of those templates? Try writing one sentence. If you want, tell me which stance you want to take (agree, disagree, partly agree) and I’ll give focused feedback and help you refine it.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:18:20.500Z

**You:** Let’s revise topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:18:45.134Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s get focused so this session helps you most.

1) Negotiating targets
Which two (at most) would you most like to work on right now? Pick up to two:
A. Clarity and strength of argument (thesis and topic sentences)
B. Organization and paragraph structure
C. Grammar and sentence accuracy
D. Vocabulary and word choice
E. Staying on topic / answering the question

Tell me your choices.

2) Confirm the task topic
Your current draft talks about AI and jobs, but the assignment prompt is about climate change and whether individual actions matter compared to governments and corporations. Which do you want to do for this revision?
a) Keep the original climate change prompt (we will rewrite the essay to answer the climate question), or
b) Change the assignment to be about AI and jobs (so we change the prompt and focus)?

Tell me a) or b).

3) Thesis stance
If we keep the climate prompt: which position do you want to take on this statement?
- I agree that individual actions are insignificant
- I disagree (individual actions are significant)
- I partly agree / mixed view

Pick one stance, then try to write one clear thesis sentence using one of these templates:
- “I [agree/disagree/partly agree] that individual actions are [insignificant/significant] in the fight against climate change because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”
- Or: “While [acknowledge the other side], I [position]. I will show this by discussing [point 1], [point 2], and [point 3].”

Would you like to try writing that thesis now? Type one sentence — I’ll give focused feedback and help you improve it.

4) Paragraph choice for revision
Which body paragraph do you want to work on after the thesis? (Options based on your draft: paragraph 2 — the paragraph about machines increasing production/costs, or paragraph 3 — the paragraph about jobs being undermined.) Pick one.

When you answer these (targets, a/b, stance + attempted thesis, paragraph choice), we’ll move to Step 1 and revise the thesis together.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:18:53.778Z

**You:** Let’s revise one body language

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:19:42.318Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’ll guide you step by step. First, let’s negotiate clear targets and confirm what we’re revising.

1) Choose up to two revision targets (A–E). Which do you want to focus on?
A. Clarity and strength of argument (thesis and topic sentences)
B. Organization and paragraph structure
C. Grammar and sentence accuracy
D. Vocabulary and word choice
E. Staying on topic / answering the question

2) Quick diagnostic summary (based on the rubric)
- Content & Ideas: You have some relevant ideas (automation, 24-hour machines, cost savings, job loss), but the draft does not match the assigned prompt about climate change — it focuses on AI and jobs. The thesis is vague and doesn’t answer the question.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Paragraphs lack clear topic sentences and logical flow; ideas repeat.
- Vocabulary: Basic and sometimes incorrect word choices (e.g., “manufactured more efficiency,” “employment was fell”).
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Many grammar, tense, article, and word-order errors that make meaning unclear.
- Strengths: You attempt both sides (positive/negative) and mention concrete, developable points.

3) Important decision about the task topic
Do you want to:
a) Keep the original climate-change prompt (so we must revise the essay content to discuss individuals vs governments/corporations on climate), or
b) Change the assignment to be about AI and jobs (so we revise under a different prompt)?

Tell me a) or b).

4) If we keep the climate prompt — pick your stance (one only)
- I agree that individual actions are insignificant
- I disagree (individual actions are significant)
- I partly agree / mixed view

Then try writing one thesis sentence now using one of these templates:
- “I [agree/disagree/partly agree] that individual actions are [insignificant/significant] in the fight against climate change because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”
- Or: “While [acknowledge the other side], I [position]. I will show this by discussing [point 1], [point 2], and [point 3].”

Please type one sentence. I will give focused feedback and help you improve it.

5) Which body paragraph shall we revise after the thesis?
- Paragraph 2 (your paragraph about machines increasing production/costs)
- Paragraph 3 (your paragraph about job loss and AI replacing humans)

One more note: I think you meant “paragraph” when you wrote “body language.” Which paragraph do you mean?

When you reply with:
- your target choices (up to two),
- a) or b) for the topic,
- your stance (if a),
- your one-sentence thesis attempt,
- and which paragraph to work on —

we’ll begin Step 1 and revise the thesis together. Would you like to try the thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:19:57.985Z

**You:** Let’s revise the rest of the essay

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:20:19.572Z

**Assistant:** Nice — thanks for sharing your draft. Before we begin revising, let’s set clear goals and confirm the task so our work is focused and useful.

1) Quick diagnostic (brief)
- Content & Ideas: Your draft has clear ideas about AI and jobs, but the assignment prompt asks about climate change and whether individual actions matter compared with governments and corporations. Right now the topic does not match the prompt. Your main viewpoint sentence is vague and underdeveloped.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Paragraphs lack clear topic sentences and logical flow; ideas repeat.
- Vocabulary: Basic and some incorrect word forms/collocations.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Frequent errors (tenses, articles, word order) that make meaning unclear.
- Strengths: You show both positive and negative sides and mention concrete, developable points (e.g., machines work 24 hours; lower costs).

2) Negotiating targets — pick up to two (A–E). Which do you want to focus on now?
A. Clarity and strength of argument (thesis and topic sentences)
B. Organization and paragraph structure
C. Grammar and sentence accuracy
D. Vocabulary and word choice
E. Staying on topic / answering the question

Please tell me which one or two you choose.

3) Important decision about the task topic
Your essay currently talks about AI/jobs, but the given prompt is about climate change. Which do you want to revise for this session?
a) Keep the original climate-change prompt (we will rewrite the essay to answer the climate question), or
b) Change the assignment to be about AI and jobs (so we revise the essay to match that different prompt)?

Pick a) or b).

4) If you choose a) (keep climate prompt) — pick your stance (one only) and try one thesis sentence now
Which stance do you want?
- I agree that individual actions are insignificant
- I disagree (individual actions are significant)
- I partly agree / mixed view

Then try to write one sentence thesis using one of these templates:
- “I [agree/disagree/partly agree] that individual actions are [insignificant/significant] in the fight against climate change because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”
- Or: “While [acknowledge the other side], I [position]. I will show this by discussing [point 1], [point 2], and [point 3].”

Would you like to try writing that one sentence now? (I’ll give focused feedback and help you refine it.)

5) Paragraph choice for revision
After the thesis, which body paragraph would you like to work on?
- Paragraph 2 (your paragraph about machines increasing production/costs)
- Paragraph 3 (your paragraph about job loss and AI replacing humans)

Tell me your choices for 2), 3), 4) (if relevant), and 5). Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 1 and revise the thesis together. Would you like to try the thesis now?
