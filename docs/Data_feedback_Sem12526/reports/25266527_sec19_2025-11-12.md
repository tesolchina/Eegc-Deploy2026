            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing the chat history and your progress report.

It looks like you have successfully identified and discussed the thesis statement in your essay, and you asked for helpful examples of revised thesis statements. However, you haven’t yet posted your own revised thesis, topic sentence, or paragraph revisions.

To move forward and complete the revision tasks, may I encourage you to:

1. Try rewriting your thesis statement now, using the examples and tips provided as inspiration.  
   For example, focus on making your main points clear and confident without phrases like “I think” or “I partly agree.”

2. Once you revise your thesis, choose one body paragraph and revise its topic sentence to match your clearer thesis.

3. Then revise that body paragraph itself to improve clarity, coherence, or style.

Feel free to post your revised thesis statement here anytime, and I’ll be happy to give feedback or suggestions! Taking that next step will really help deepen your writing and collaboration skills for this training.

Would you like to start by sharing your revised thesis statement now?

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:44:43.615Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:52:54.422Z

**Assistant:** Great! Thanks for sharing your thesis statement:

**"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."**

Let’s begin Step 1: **Thesis Statement Revision**

**Feedback:**
- **Clarity:** Your thesis shows your position (“partly agree”) and explains both sides, which is good.
- **Strength:** “I partly agree” is clear, but using “I think” or “I also think” can be more confident and precise.
- **Focus & Preview:** It previews that you’ll discuss citizens’ influence and personal lifestyle choices—strong! But it might be even more specific. You could mention how citizens influence governments and how lifestyle choices matter, just less.

**Suggestions:**
- Avoid “I also think”, “I partly agree.” Instead, use strong language—state your point of view confidently.
- Make sure your thesis answers the essay question and clearly previews your two main points.
- Could you specify why government influence is “very important” or why green choices are “less impactful”?

**Prompt for revision:**
Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement now, using stronger, more precise language and making sure it previews your essay structure? 

If you need a hint: think about making your viewpoint clear (“While individual actions are limited, citizens play a crucial role in driving government change, which is the key to addressing climate change”) and include mention of lifestyle choices.

Let me know your revised thesis when you’re ready!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:53:03.217Z

**You:** Can you give me some examples please?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:57:02.036Z

**Assistant:** Of course! I’m happy to give you a few **example thesis statements** (but remember, you should try your own revision, not just use these!) These are model sentences to inspire your thinking and help you feel more confident:

**Example 1:**  
While individual lifestyle choices have a limited impact on climate change, citizens play a crucial role by influencing governments to enact meaningful environmental policies.

**Example 2:**  
Citizens’ influence over government decisions is essential for addressing climate change, but personal green habits also contribute positively, even if their effect is smaller.

**Example 3:**  
Although everyday eco-friendly actions can help, the most effective way individuals can fight climate change is by demanding stronger action from political leaders.

**Tips:**  
- Notice how these examples use clear, confident language (no “I think”).
- They specify the two main points: government influence and personal choices.
- Each one directly answers the essay question and previews what will be discussed.

Would you like to try writing your own revised thesis statement using these examples for inspiration? Take your time—when you’re ready, share your revision with me!
