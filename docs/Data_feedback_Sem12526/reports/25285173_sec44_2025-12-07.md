            ## Contribution Analysis

            The draft FINAL ASSESSMENT REPORT is comprehensive and clearly highlights strengths, areas for improvement, and recommended next steps based on essay content and the AI-assisted writing process.

Here is a concise summary of key points and suggestions for next actions:

---

### Summary of Findings

**Essay Content & Writing:**
- The student’s central claim is consistent but underdeveloped.
- Ideas are general; lack concrete examples and mechanisms.
- Organization presents two points but with overlap and weak transitions.
- Vocabulary and grammar contain frequent errors that harm clarity.
- The revised essay does not show meaningful improvements; placeholders like “bla bla bla” replace real content.

**Human-AI Interaction:**
- The student engaged minimally: restated the original thesis and added filler, rather than revising or reflecting on AI suggestions.
- There was no evidence of critical evaluation or iterative revising with AI.
- Interaction quality is low, indicating a need for better understanding and active participation in collaborative revision.

---

### Recommendations for the Student

1. **Revise Thesis Statement:**  
   Adopt or adapt the suggested clear, previewing thesis, for example:  
   *“I largely agree that automation will enhance global employment prospects in the long term because it raises production efficiency—allowing firms to expand and invest—and creates new industries and roles that require different skills.”*

2. **Improve Paragraph Focus:**  
   Pick one body paragraph (e.g., about new jobs) and:  
   - Rewrite its topic sentence to state a distinct, focused claim.  
   - Add concrete examples or brief data supporting this claim.

3. **Correct Language Errors:**  
   Systematically revise grammar issues: subject-verb agreement, article use, verb forms, and punctuation.  
   Replace imprecise or incorrect vocabulary and collocations with precise academic language (e.g., “automation promotes production efficiency”).

4. **Engage Actively with AI:**  
   In future sessions, respond directly to AI suggestions—accept, modify, or explain reasons to reject.  
   This iterative dialogue improves revision depth and writing quality.

5. **Remove Placeholders:**  
   Replace any filler text (“bla bla bla”) with substantive content aligned with essay arguments.

---

### Instructor Suggestions

- Require the student to submit a new draft that:  
  - Includes a revised, previewing thesis statement.  
  - Has one fully revised body paragraph with clear topic sentence and supporting evidence.  
  - Shows a brief reflection (3–5 sentences) on which AI suggestions they accepted or rejected and why.

- Use the reflection to gauge the student’s understanding and ability to engage with AI feedback critically.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The essay takes a clear stance that automation will enhance long‑term employment and gives two main reasons (efficiency/profits and new jobs/majors). However, ideas are general and underdeveloped; mechanisms and concrete examples are missing.
- Organization: 17/25 - A basic two-point structure is present, but points overlap and transitions are weak (e.g., second paragraph repeats benefits already claimed in the first). Paragraphing is inconsistent and some sentences break logical flow.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Word choice is often imprecise or repetitive ("automatic intelligence", "automatic machine", "promote the efficiency"), and collocations are incorrect (e.g., “abundant of student”, “data analyzer”). Limited range reduces clarity.
- Grammar: 15/25 - Frequent grammatical errors and punctuation issues (subject-verb agreement, articles, verb forms, sentence fragments) interfere with readability but the overall meaning is still recoverable.
- **Original Essay Total: 65/100**

Evidence (original): thesis sentence: “From my perspective, I firmly believe this technological shift will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.” Example grammar issues: “automation promote the efficiency of the production,”; “As the automatic machine emerged and be used ... the production efficiency has increased in a significant range.”

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The revised draft shows no substantive content development; it repeats the original claims and inserts placeholder text (“bla bla bla……”) rather than strengthening arguments or adding evidence.
- Organization: 16/25 - Structure remains the same as the original; placeholders interrupt logical flow and do not clarify or improve paragraph links.
- Vocabulary: 14/25 - No meaningful vocabulary improvements; errors remain and placeholders reduce academic tone.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Grammar errors persist and added placeholders further damage coherence (e.g., sentence fragments and punctuation remain uncorrected).
- **Revised Essay Total: 61/100**

Evidence (revised): student retained the original thesis verbatim and added filler: “From my perspective, I firmly believe this technological shift will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.bla bla bla……” and similarly in other places: “Which enhance the society welfare and global employment prospects in the long term.bla bla……”

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -4 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None substantive — the revised essay did not implement the suggested thesis rewrite or paragraph-level revisions.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Revise the thesis to preview reasons and remove hedging (the assistant suggested: “I largely agree that automation will enhance global employment prospects in the long term because it raises production efficiency—enabling firms to expand and invest—and it creates new industries and roles that require different skills.”).
  - Strengthen the topic sentence of the second paragraph to make it distinct from the first and avoid overlap.
  - Edit grammar, fix collocations, and replace placeholders (“bla bla…”) with concrete examples or evidence (statistics, industry examples, or clearer mechanisms).

---

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 5** (assistant-user-assistant-user-assistant)
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided a clear, structured revision plan and a model thesis; the student engaged minimally by repeating the original thesis and selecting “let's revise the thesis statement,” but did not accept the model or produce a revised thesis. No topic-sentence or paragraph revisions occurred in the chat.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 - The assistant offered a detailed, stepwise plan. The chat, however, is short (5 messages) and lacks the depth (multiple iterations/questions) expected for higher scores. Evidence: assistant outlined a three-step revision process but only one step was engaged.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 - The student did not critically evaluate or respond to the AI’s proposed thesis model. Evidence: assistant provided a model thesis (“I largely agree that automation will enhance...”), but the student reposted the original thesis unchanged and did not accept or comment on the model.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 - There is no evidence of iterative revision cycles. The assistant proposed Step 1–3; the student did not follow through beyond restating the original thesis, and the revised essay contains no actual revisions (only inserted fillers).
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 4/15**

Evidence excerpts:
- Assistant suggested a model thesis: “I largely agree that automation will enhance global employment prospects in the long term because it raises production efficiency—enabling firms to expand and invest—and it creates new industries and roles that require different skills.”
- Student response (no revision): “From my perspective, I firmly believe this technological shift will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.” (same wording used in revised essay with filler text added).

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student has a clear central claim: automation will enhance long‑term employment prospects (evidence: identical thesis in both drafts).
- The essay attempts an organized two-point argument (efficiency/profits and new jobs/majors), showing basic structural awareness.
- The student initiated interaction with the AI and followed the assistant’s initial instruction to focus on the thesis.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Thesis revision: remove hedging, state extent, and preview reasons concisely — accept or adapt the assistant’s model.
- Active engagement with AI: respond to suggested revisions, justify acceptance or rejection, and iterate.
- Language accuracy: correct grammar, collocation, punctuation, and sentence structure to improve clarity and academic tone.
- Development and evidence: replace general claims with concrete examples, brief data, or clearer causal explanations showing how automation leads to higher wages or new job roles.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student provided the essay but did not specify further priorities beyond “let's revise the thesis statement,” and did not respond to the assistant’s diagnostic choices.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The assistant provided a clear plan; the student did not follow through with planned steps nor set revision choices.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student did not critique or accept specific AI suggestions; no evidence of weighing alternatives.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The revised essay contains filler text rather than substantive edits, showing limited independent revision.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise the thesis now by using or adapting the assistant’s model. Example to adopt: “I largely agree that automation will enhance global employment prospects in the long term because it raises production efficiency—allowing firms to expand and invest—and creates new industries and roles that require different skills.” Insert this into the essay and remove hedges.
2. Choose one body paragraph (e.g., the paragraph about new majors/jobs) and rewrite its topic sentence so it adds a distinct contribution (for example: “Automation creates new, higher‑skilled employment opportunities by generating demand for data analysts, AI technicians, and specialists who design and maintain systems.”). Then revise supporting sentences to provide a concrete example or short explanation.
3. Perform a targeted grammar and vocabulary pass: fix subject-verb agreement, articles, and collocations (e.g., “automation promotes production efficiency,” “automatic intelligence” → “artificial intelligence”), and remove filler text.
4. In chat with the AI, explicitly accept, modify, or reject suggested revisions and ask for examples or paraphrase the suggestion to confirm understanding—this creates the iterative loop needed for stronger human-AI collaboration.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student began the AI-assisted process but did not complete the required three-step revision cycle described by the assistant. The revised essay contains placeholder text and no substantive edits; therefore the assignment’s revision tasks remain incomplete.
- Recommend that the instructor ask the student to submit a revised draft that: (a) adopts a clearer thesis (with previewed reasons), (b) includes at least one fully revised paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences), and (c) provides a brief reflection (3–5 sentences) in the chat or cover note explaining which AI suggestions were accepted/rejected and why. This will allow reassessment of both writing and collaboration skills.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
As the development of the technology, the automatic intelligence has become a hot topic in today's society. From my perspective, I firmly believe this technological shift will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.
Firstly, automation promote the efficiency of the production,  bringing more profit to the staff. As the automatic machine emerged and be used in the process of manufacturing, agriculture, and even service industries,the production efficiency has increased in a significant range.At the same time, it save plenty of time and money. As a result, companies can gain higher profits, expand their business scale, and invest more in new projects, the staff will get higher salaries and better welfare benefits, improving their overall employment quality.
Secondly, the use of the automatic intelligence broadens the market, giving more opportunities to the people who are finding a job. As the tendency of automation emerged, a lot of new majors have been set up in universities, such as "Big Data" "The Use of Automatic Intelligence",making the work choice of the graduated student more diverse.Abundant of student through this technological shift found their work they really interested in. In today's market, the data analyzer or the people who research the AI tools can enjoy sufficient resource and get high  salaries.Which enhance the society welfare and global employment prospects in the long term.
In conclusion. The automatic shift do enhance the global employment prospects in the long term through improving the efficiency of production and making more opportunities for  people. It stimulate the vigorous future of the global employment.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-07T04:43:05.457Z

**You:** let's revise the thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:11:19.235Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s do this. First, a quick check-in so we have clear targets.

1) Negotiating targets
- Your stated goals: clearer logic, more explicit viewpoint, and more convincing evidence; you also want the second point to be more novel and avoid overlap.
- Which of these do you want to focus on in this session? (You asked to revise the thesis statement — do you want to focus only on the thesis now, or also on linking the thesis more clearly to paragraph 2 later?)

2) Brief diagnostic feedback (based on common rubric categories)
- Thesis & Argument: Your draft takes a clear stance that automation will enhance long‑term employment, but the thesis is vague about the extent and it doesn’t preview specific reasons. That makes it harder for readers to follow the essay’s logic.
- Organization: The essay has a basic two-point structure (efficiency → profits/wages; new jobs/majors), but the points overlap and the second point needs sharpening so it adds something distinct.
- Evidence & Development: Claims are general and lack concrete examples, data, or clearer explanation of mechanisms (how profits translate to more jobs/wages; what exact new roles appear).
- Language Use: Frequent grammar and word-choice errors distract from the argument and reduce clarity.

Please confirm: do you want to focus on strengthening the thesis now? (If yes, we’ll revise just the thesis, then move on to topic sentence + paragraph as you want.)

Step 1 — Thesis statement revision
- Share: Your current thesis sentence is: “From my perspective, I firmly believe this technological shift will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.”
- Feedback: This states a position but needs three improvements:
  1. State the extent (e.g., “to a large extent”) so it directly answers the prompt.
  2. Preview the main reasons you will discuss (this guides the reader).
  3. Use concise, confident wording (avoid “From my perspective,” which is unnecessary).

Would you like to try rewriting it now? If you’d like a model to work from, here’s a clear, concise option you can accept, tweak, or use as inspiration:

Suggested thesis (model):
I largely agree that automation will enhance global employment prospects in the long term because it raises production efficiency—allowing firms to expand and invest—and creates new industries and roles that require different skills.

If you’re happy with that version, I’ll insert it into your essay and we’ll proceed to Step 2 (choose one body paragraph to revise topic sentence). If you want to try your own revision first, please paste your new thesis and I’ll give quick feedback. Which do you prefer?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:11:39.458Z

**You:** From my perspective, I firmly believe this technological shift will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:16:12.555Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s set clear targets before we revise. Quick questions first:

1) Which target(s) do you want to focus on in this session?
- Options based on your goals: clearer logic, a more explicit viewpoint (stronger thesis), more convincing evidence in argumentative paragraphs, and making the second point more novel/less overlapping.
- Do you want to focus only on the thesis now, or the thesis plus linking that thesis more clearly to paragraph 2 later (topic sentence + paragraph revision)? Please confirm one selection.

Brief diagnostic feedback (fast, tied to the rubric)
- Thesis & Argument: You take a clear stance that automation will improve long‑term employment, but the thesis is vague (no preview of reasons) and hedged by “From my perspective.”
- Organization: Two main points exist but they overlap (both describe benefits to jobs) and the second point is underdeveloped and repetitive.
- Evidence & Development: Claims are general; there are no concrete examples, statistics, or clear mechanisms showing how automation creates or redistributes jobs.
- Language Use: Frequent grammar, word-choice, and punctuation errors reduce clarity and authority.

Please pick which diagnosed issues you want to work on now (e.g., “thesis only,” or “thesis + topic sentence of paragraph 2,” or “thesis + paragraph 2 content as well”). Once you confirm, we’ll start Step 1.

Step 1 — Thesis revision
- Your current thesis: “From my perspective, I firmly believe this technological shift will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.”
- Feedback (what to improve):
  1. Remove unnecessary hedging (“From my perspective”) — a thesis should be direct and confident.
  2. State the extent (e.g., “largely agree” or “to a considerable extent”) so it answers the prompt’s “to what extent” part.
  3. Preview the main reasons (2–3 brief reasons) so readers know the essay’s structure and logic.

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Try one short sentence that:
- States your stance clearly,
- Says to what extent,
- Lists the two reasons you will discuss (efficiency/firm expansion and new jobs/industries, or similar).

If you’d like a model to use or tweak, here’s one you can adopt or adjust:
I largely agree that automation will enhance global employment prospects in the long term because it raises production efficiency—enabling firms to expand and invest—and it creates new industries and roles that require different skills.

Which would you like to do: (A) try your own revised thesis now, or (B) accept/tweak the model above? If you accept the model, I’ll insert it into your essay and we’ll move on to Step 2 (choose a body paragraph to revise the topic sentence).
