            ## Contribution Analysis

            It’s great that you’re asking about connecting topic sentences to your thesis statement—this connection is key to a clear, well-organized essay.

**To connect your topic sentence to the thesis, make sure it:**

1. **Includes key words or ideas from the thesis:**  
   Echo some important words or themes so the reader sees the direct link. For example, if your thesis says “Stricter government laws are essential to protect migrant workers by guaranteeing fair wages and ensuring safer working conditions,” your topic sentences should also mention “stricter laws” and either “fair wages” or “working conditions.”

2. **States the specific main point for that paragraph:**  
   The topic sentence should preview what the paragraph will explain—for example, how laws protect fair wages or how they improve safety.

3. **Uses a clear signal or transition:**  
   Words like “Firstly,” “Secondly,” or “Another way” help guide the reader and show you’re expanding on specific parts of your thesis.

---

### Example from your essay:

**Thesis:**  
“Stricter government laws are essential to protect migrant workers, as they will guarantee fair wages and ensure safer, better working conditions.”

**Connected Topic Sentences:**  
- *“Firstly, stricter government laws are necessary to protect migrant construction workers by ensuring they receive fair wages.”*  
- *“Secondly, stricter government regulations will improve the working conditions and safety of migrant workers.”*

Each topic sentence:  
- Uses “stricter government laws/regulations” as the subject (linking to the thesis)  
- Specifies the paragraph’s focus (fair wages / working conditions)  
- Is ordered with “Firstly,” “Secondly,” matching the order in the thesis

---

### Quick steps to do this yourself:

1. Look at your thesis and underline the main points (e.g., “stricter laws,” “fair wages,” “better working conditions”).  
2. Start your topic sentence with a reference to “stricter laws” or “government regulations.”  
3. Clearly state what this paragraph will prove related to those main points (e.g., that laws ensure fair pay or improve safety).  
4. Use a transition word if it fits (“Firstly,” “Secondly,” etc.).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 18**
- **Conversation Quality:** Dialogue is organized, with the student following the three-step revision module (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph); some exchange of ideas, but the student requests direct models and often accepts suggestions without deep critical engagement.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation:** **3/5** – Adequate exchanges with clear progression, but dialogue is sometimes surface-level; most questions are about wording and structure, not deeper aspects like evidence or argument complexity.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions:** **3/5** – The student demonstrates some evaluation (tries own versions of sentences), but mainly prefers to accept or slightly tweak suggested revisions; limited justification or rejection of AI suggestions.
- **Refining Process:** **3/5** – There is a limited iterative revision, with guided improvements in selected sentences and paragraphs; after initial feedback, changes are made, but the process is often one-cycle and superficial.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 9/15**

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Willingness to engage with revision steps, especially thesis and topic sentences (e.g., "revise my thesis statement," "revise my topic sentence").
- Improved clarity in argument and topic focus post-revision ("Stricter government laws are essential…").
- Corrected several major grammar/vocabulary errors after guided feedback (e.g., "sign any contracts").

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Need for deeper critical engagement with AI suggestions (explain, question, or challenge models to fit personal voice and argument).
- Essay content should go beyond surface explanation—add depth and examples, and critically analyze.
- Persistent sentence-level errors suggest more attention is needed on grammar and vocabulary. Proofreading and editing should be more independent.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision:** Good – The student shares the essay and follows the assistant’s instructions and module structure.
- **Strategic Planning:** Needs Improvement – Responses are reactive and follow the AI’s prompts closely; student rarely sets own goals or priorities beyond requesting specific revisions.
- **Critical Evaluation:** Developing – Some attempts at original revisions, but mostly depends on AI models without critique or rationale.
- **Independent Editing:** Needs Improvement – Editing is mainly supervised by AI; minimal evidence of self-driven correction or voice.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing Skills:** Expand body paragraphs with specific examples and evidence; focus on developing ideas and argument depth, not just surface structure.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills:** Engage critically with AI feedback—ask "why," adapt suggestions to your own style, and try to justify acceptance or rejection of advice.
3. **Overall Improvement:** Build stronger proofreading habits; after revising with AI, independently review grammar, vocabulary, and idea flow to polish writing quality.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student followed the structured three-step revision process for thesis, topic sentence, and a body paragraph, but did not fully revise the second body paragraph as required (the last interaction is incomplete). 
- Encourage the student to participate more actively in revision decisions, rather than relying exclusively on model suggestions. More in-depth critical thinking and independent editing practice should be integrated into future work.

---

*Assessment based on essay drafts and 18-step chat interaction. For final grading, completion of all three revision steps (thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph) should be confirmed.*

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
The exploitation faced by migrant workers is a long-lasting issue because there is lack of law to regulate the employer. Migrant worker always faced unequal situation. Therefore, it is important for the government to have stricter laws to safeguard workers’ right. Establishment of stricter laws not only can give a more fair wage , but can also provide better living condition.

Firstly, laws protect migrant workers from unfair pay, especially who are working in construction works. The construction workers usually have low literacy rate so it is difficult for them to protect their right during working. Most of the workers do not sigh any contrast. As a result, even though they work for very long hours, they only get little among of money. According to a research, there are more than half of the workers in China only get minimum wages. With the low wages, they also have relatively poor working condition because they cannot safeguard their right due to low literacy rate.

Secondly, the working condition can be improved with stricter law regulations. Migrant workers usually have language barrier so they could not communicate with their employer. Although there are some safety measures they need to obey in the factories, they may not understand the measures.  therefore, incidents may happen such as fingers were trapped in the machine. There are some news reported that nearly 30% of incidents were happened was due to unable the read the safety measures in the factories. Therefore, the law can stated that all workers should get pass in a safety test before working so as to prevent the incident.

In conclusion, it is vital for the government to have a stricter law to safeguard the right of migrant workers. As a result, migrant workers can get a fair pay. More importantly, they can work in a safety condition to prevent accident. 


Revised:
The exploitation faced by migrant workers is a long-lasting issue because there is lack of law to regulate the employer. Migrant worker always faced unequal situation. Stricter government laws are essential to protect migrant workers, as they will guarantee fair wages and ensure safer, better working conditions.

Firstly, stricter government laws are necessary to protect migrant construction workers by ensuring them to get fair wages.  The construction workers usually have a low literacy rate which makes it difficult for them to understand their legal rights at work. Most of the workers do not sign any contrasts. As a result, even though they work for very long hours, they only receive a small among of money. According to a research, there are more than half of the workers in China only get minimum wages. With such low wages, they also have relatively poor working condition because they cannot safeguard their right  due to low literacy.

Secondly, stricter government regulations will improve the working conditions and safety of migrant workers. Migrant workers usually have language barrier so they may not communicate with their employer. Although there are some safety measures they need to follow in the factories, they may not understand them . Therefore, workplace accidents can occur, such as workers’ fingers becoming trapped in machines. According to news reports, nearly 30% of factory accidents occur because workers cannot read or understand the safety instructions. The law should require all workers to pass a safety test before starting work to prevent such accident.

In conclusion, it is vital for the government to have a stricter laws to safeguard the right of migrant workers. As a result, migrant workers can get a fair pay. More importantly, they can work in a safety condition to prevent accident.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-19T09:55:02.668Z

**You:** revise my thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-19T10:22:57.173Z

**Assistant:** Great! Before we move on, let’s clarify your personal goals a bit.

**Negotiating Targets**  
You’ve asked to revise your thesis statement. Are you mainly hoping to:  
- Make your overall argument clearer and more focused?  
- Improve how your thesis previews your main points?  
- Use stronger, more confident language?  
Or is there something else you want to achieve with your thesis revision?

Just let me know your main goal for this part of your essay!

**Diagnostic Feedback (Thesis & Argument)**  
Your current thesis statement is:
> “The exploitation faced by migrant workers is a long-lasting issue because there is lack of law to regulate the employer. Migrant worker always faced unequal situation. Therefore, it is important for the government to have stricter laws to safeguard workers’ right. Establishment of stricter laws not only can give a more fair wage , but can also provide better living condition.”

**Strengths:**  
- You clearly introduce the topic and show what concerns you (exploitation, lack of laws, unfair situations).
- You mention your viewpoint: that stricter laws are important for migrant workers.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- The thesis is split into several sentences; it would be stronger as one focused statement.
- Some phrasing is unclear or awkward (“give a more fair wage,” “lack of law to regulate the employer”).
- The thesis could do more to preview the structure and main points (fair wages, better working/living conditions).
- Confident and precise language could be improved (avoid “can give,” use “will ensure” or similar).
- The thesis should directly answer the essay question and avoid extra details.

**Student Priority Selection**  
Would you like to focus mostly on:  
- Making the thesis one clear, strong statement?  
- Making sure it previews the main points (“fair wages,” “better conditions”)?  
- Improving word choice for confidence and clarity?  
Or a mix of these?

Please confirm your priority, and then I’ll help you revise!

Once you reply, I’ll offer constructive feedback and guide you through rewriting your thesis statement. Would you like to start by putting your ideas together into one sentence, or shall I suggest a starting model for you?

*Time:* 2025-11-19T10:23:04.349Z

**You:** give me a revised version for my thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-19T10:24:23.895Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Before I give a model, I want to confirm your priority. Based on your answer, you want your thesis to be:

- One clear, strong statement  
- That previews your main points ("fair wages" and "better conditions")  
- Using confident, precise language  

**Here is a model thesis statement based on your essay topic:**  
> “Stricter government laws are essential to protect migrant workers, as they will guarantee fair wages and ensure safer, better working conditions.”

Let’s check together:
- Does it clearly state your argument? Yes: You believe stricter laws are necessary.
- Does it preview the main points? Yes: fair wages and better working conditions.
- Is it confident? Yes: “are essential,” “will guarantee,” “ensure.”

**Would you like to try writing your own thesis using this model, or do you want to edit the model to better fit your style?**

For example, you could try:
> “To safeguard migrant workers’ rights, the government must pass stricter laws that guarantee fair pay and improve workplace safety.”

**Would you like to choose, adapt, or try your own? Let me know—then we’ll confirm before moving on!**

*Time:* 2025-11-19T10:24:27.760Z

**You:** revise my topic sentence

*Time:* 2025-11-19T10:27:16.043Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s move on to revising your topic sentence for one body paragraph.

**Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision**

First, please tell me which paragraph you'd like to work on:  
- The first body paragraph (about unfair pay and wages)?  
- Or the second body paragraph (about working conditions and safety)?

If you are choosing the first paragraph, here is the current topic sentence:

> “Firstly, laws protect migrant workers from unfair pay, especially who are working in construction works.”

**Feedback:**
- The sentence is a bit unclear and could be more directly connected to the thesis.
- The phrasing “especially who are working in construction works” needs correction.
- Try to preview your main idea (laws will guarantee fair wages) more clearly and confidently.

**Step-by-step Guidance:**  
Would you like to try revising this topic sentence yourself first, or get a model?

**Hints for improvement:**
- Start by connecting the topic sentence directly to your thesis.
- Be specific: mention fair wages, protection, and construction workers if you want.

**Example Model (for you to adapt, not copy directly):**  
> “Stricter laws will protect migrant construction workers by ensuring they receive fair wages.”

Would you like to try rewriting your topic sentence now? If yes, write it below and I’ll help you polish it!

If you want to work on the second paragraph instead, let me know!

*Time:* 2025-11-19T10:27:19.890Z

**You:** work on the first paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-19T10:28:45.471Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! Let’s focus on revising the topic sentence for your first body paragraph.

**Your original topic sentence:**  
> “Firstly, laws protect migrant workers to get a fair wage, especially who are working in construction works.”

**Feedback Recap:**  
- The meaning is a bit unclear.
- The phrase “especially who are working in construction works” needs rephrasing.
- The sentence can more clearly connect to the thesis: stricter laws → protection → fair wages → construction workers.

**Hints for Revising:**

- Clearly state how stricter laws protect migrant workers in construction from unfair wages.
- Use confident, direct language.
- Link this topic sentence with your thesis so readers see the progression of your argument.

**Here’s a fill-in-the-blanks start you could try:**
“Stricter government laws are necessary to protect migrant construction workers by ______________.”

Or, feel free to try your own complete sentence!

**Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence now? Type your version below, and I’ll give feedback and help you polish it.**

*Time:* 2025-11-19T10:28:50.007Z

**You:** Firstly, stricter government laws are necessary to protect migrant construction workers by fair wages.

*Time:* 2025-11-19T10:30:51.463Z

**Assistant:** Great job giving it a try! Your new topic sentence is much clearer and shows a direct connection to your thesis. Let’s look at it closely:

**Your revised topic sentence:**  
> “Firstly, stricter government laws are necessary to protect migrant construction workers by fair wages.”

**Strengths:**  
- Connects stricter government laws to the protection of migrant construction workers.
- Uses confident language (“are necessary”).

**Suggestions for improvement:**  
- The phrase “by fair wages” needs adjustment for clarity. You want to say that laws will ensure migrant construction workers **receive** fair wages.
- It’s a bit smoother if you say “…protect migrant construction workers by ensuring they receive fair wages.”

**Polished version:**  
> “Firstly, stricter government laws are necessary to protect migrant construction workers by ensuring they receive fair wages.”

Would you like to use this revised sentence, or do you want to adapt it further for your style?  
Let me know! If you’re satisfied, we’ll move on to revising the rest of this paragraph for clarity and unity.

---

**Step 3 — Revising the Rest of the Paragraph**

Here’s your current first body paragraph, with the new topic sentence at the start:

> **Firstly, stricter government laws are necessary to protect migrant construction workers by ensuring they receive fair wages.** The construction workers usually have low literacy rate so it is difficult for them to protect their right during working. Most of the workers do not sigh any contrast. As a result, even though they work for very long hours, they only get little among of money. According to a research, there are more than half of the workers in China only get minimum wages. With the low wages, they also have relatively poor working condition because they cannot safeguard their right due to low literacy rate.

**Guiding revision questions:**
- Do all supporting sentences clearly relate to the new topic sentence?
- Is there any sentence that could be rewritten for clarity or better flow?
- Is there evidence or explanation that needs to be expanded or made clearer?

**Hints:**
- Check for grammar or word choice issues: “sigh any contrast” (should be “sign any contracts”), “little among of money” (should be “a small amount of money”).
- Consider streamlining ideas and making clear connections: Low literacy → can’t protect rights → get poor wages.
- Make sure the evidence supports the idea of unfair wages.

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to choose one or two sentences to revise first (for grammar or clarity), or would you prefer a guided suggestion on how to improve a particular sentence?  
For example, you could try to rephrase:  
> “Most of the workers do not sigh any contrast.”  
or  
> “even though they work for very long hours, they only get little among of money.”

Let me know which sentence you’d like to work on, and we’ll improve it together!

*Time:* 2025-11-19T10:30:59.434Z

**You:** prefer guided suggestion

*Time:* 2025-11-19T10:34:05.303Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let’s work together, step by step, using guided suggestions so you can make strong, clear revisions.

Here’s your revised paragraph with the new topic sentence:

> **Firstly, stricter government laws are necessary to protect migrant construction workers by ensuring they receive fair wages.** The construction workers usually have low literacy rate so it is difficult for them to protect their right during working. Most of the workers do not sigh any contrast. As a result, even though they work for very long hours, they only get little among of money. According to a research, there are more than half of the workers in China only get minimum wages. With the low wages, they also have relatively poor working condition because they cannot safeguard their right due to low literacy rate.

Let’s focus on one sentence at a time:

**Sentence 1 (needs grammar and clarity help):**  
> “The construction workers usually have low literacy rate so it is difficult for them to protect their right during working.”

**Guided suggestion:**
- Add “a” before “low literacy rate.”
- “Protect their right during working” could be clearer. Maybe: “…which makes it difficult for them to understand their legal rights at work.”

Would you like to try revising this sentence now?  

**Or here’s a model you can adapt:**  
> “Many construction workers have a low literacy rate, making it difficult for them to understand and protect their rights at work.”

Would you like to use this version, or edit it further to match your own style?  
Once you confirm, we’ll move to the next sentence!

---

**Next sentence:**  
> “Most of the workers do not sigh any contrast.”

**Guided suggestion:**
- “Sigh any contrast” should be “sign any contracts.”
- You could say: “Most of the workers do not sign any contracts with their employers.”

Would you like to try writing your version?

---

**And another sentence needing revision:**  
> “even though they work for very long hours, they only get little among of money.”

**Guided suggestion:**
- “little among of money” can be “a small amount of money.”
- You might say: “Even though they work long hours, they receive only a small amount of money.”

Would you like to try revising this line?

---

**Let’s work together:**  
Try revising any of the sentences above, or tell me which one you want to edit first—then send your version, and I’ll help you polish it!  
If you’d like to work on all three in sequence, you can write all three revised sentences and I’ll check them.

**Which sentence would you like to try revising first?**

*Time:* 2025-11-19T10:34:14.715Z

**You:** The construction workers usually have low a literacy rate which makes it difficult for them to understand their legal rights at work. Most of the workers do not sign any contrast. As a result, even though they work for very long hours, they only receive small among of money.

*Time:* 2025-11-19T10:36:37.283Z

**Assistant:** Excellent effort! Let’s review your three revised sentences together for clarity and accuracy.

**Your revised sentences:**

> The construction workers usually have low a literacy rate which makes it difficult for them to understand their legal rights at work. Most of the workers do not sign any contrast. As a result, even though they work for very long hours, they only receive small among of money.

---

### Feedback & Guided Improvements

**1. First sentence:**
> “The construction workers usually have low a literacy rate which makes it difficult for them to understand their legal rights at work.”

- Minor grammar fix: The phrase should be "a low literacy rate."
- You could make it even smoother by joining ideas with a comma.

**Suggested revision:**
> "Construction workers usually have a low literacy rate, which makes it difficult for them to understand their legal rights at work."

---

**2. Second sentence:**
> “Most of the workers do not sign any contrast.”

- There’s a vocabulary mistake: "contrast" should be "contracts."
- Adding "with their employers" makes it clearer.

**Suggested revision:**
> "Most of these workers do not sign any contracts with their employers."

---

**3. Third sentence:**
> “As a result, even though they work for very long hours, they only receive small among of money.”

- Grammar adjustment: "small among of money" should be "a small amount of money."
- You can also say "even though they work very long hours, they only receive a small amount of money."

**Suggested revision:**
> "As a result, even though they work very long hours, they only receive a small amount of money."

---

Would you like to use these revised sentences, or would you like to adapt them further to match your style?  
If you’re happy with these, here’s how your improved paragraph looks all together:

---

**Full Revised First Body Paragraph:**

Firstly, stricter government laws are necessary to protect migrant construction workers by ensuring they receive fair wages. Construction workers usually have a low literacy rate, which makes it difficult for them to understand their legal rights at work. Most of these workers do not sign any contracts with their employers. As a result, even though they work very long hours, they only receive a small amount of money. According to research, more than half of migrant workers in China only get minimum wages. With such low wages, they also have relatively poor working conditions because they cannot safeguard their rights due to low literacy.

*Time:* 2025-11-19T10:39:15.798Z

**Assistant:** Let’s revise your second body paragraph step by step, using the same interactive and supportive approach.

## 1. Identify the Topic Sentence

**Current topic sentence:**  
> Secondly, the working condition can be improved with stricter law regulations.

### Feedback:
- The idea is good, but the language needs to be more precise and confident.
- It's better to use the plural “working conditions.”
- Try to make the connection to your thesis clearer: Stricter laws → improved working conditions (especially safety).

## 2. Revising Supporting Sentences

### Original Supporting Sentences:
> Migrant workers usually have language barrier so they could not communicate with their employer. Although there are some safety measures they need to obey in the factories, they may not understand the measures.  therefore, incidents may happen such as fingers were trapped in the machine. There are some news reported that nearly 30% of incidents were happened was due to unable the read the safety measures in the factories. Therefore, the law can stated that all workers should get pass in a safety test before working so as to prevent the incident.

### Guiding questions:
- Do these sentences clearly relate to the revised topic sentence?
- Are there grammar or clarity issues?
- Is there a logical flow?

### Let’s revise one sentence at a time.

#### **First sentence:**  
**Original:** “Migrant workers usually have language barrier so they could not communicate with their employer.”

Suggestions:
- Add “a” before “language barrier.”
- “could not” should be “cannot.”
- Connect to understanding safety measures.

**Example to adapt:**  
> “Migrant workers often face a language barrier, which makes it difficult for them to communicate with their employers or understand safety instructions.”

#### **Second sentence:**  
**Original:** “Although there are some safety measures they need to obey in the factories, they may not understand the measures.”

Suggestions:
- Repeat “measures” is wordy; try “follow” instead of “obey.”
- Clarify for smoother flow.

**Example:**  
> “Even though there are safety rules in the factories, they may not understand them.”

#### **Third sentence:**  
**Original:** “therefore, incidents may happen such as fingers were trapped in the machine.”

Suggestions:
- Capitalize “Therefore.”
- Clarify: “accidents may occur, such as…”
- Improve wording: “fingers becoming trapped in machines.”

**Example:**  
> “Therefore, workplace accidents can occur, such as workers’ fingers becoming trapped in machines.”

---

#### **Fourth sentence:**  
**Original:** “There are some news reported that nearly 30% of incidents were happened was due to unable the read the safety measures in the factories.”

Suggestions:
- Grammar issues.
- Clarify subject: “according to news reports...”
- Fix “unable to read.”

**Example:**  
> “According to news reports, nearly 30% of factory accidents occur because workers cannot read or understand the safety instructions.”

## 3. Bringing It All Together (Model Paragraph)

**If you would like, here’s how the whole paragraph could look using the suggested improvements (please adapt as you wish):**

> Secondly, stricter government regulations will improve the working conditions and safety of migrant workers. Migrant workers often face a language barrier, which makes it difficult for them to communicate with their employers or understand safety instructions. Even though there are safety rules in factories, they may not understand them. Therefore, workplace accidents can occur, such as workers’ fingers becoming trapped in machines. According to news reports, nearly 30% of factory accidents occur because workers cannot read or understand the safety instructions. Stricter laws should require all workers to pass a safety test before starting work to help prevent such incidents.

**You:** how can topic sentence connect to thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-19T10:40:38.202Z

**Assistant:** Great question! Making sure your **topic sentence connects directly to your thesis statement** is important for strong academic writing. Here’s how and why you should do it—and some quick examples and steps to help you.

---

### **Why connect the topic sentence to the thesis?**
- It shows your paragraph is supporting your main argument (your thesis).
- It helps the reader follow your essay’s logical structure.
- It gives unity to your writing and makes your ideas clearer.

---

### **How can you make the connection?**

**1. Repeat Key Ideas or Words from Your Thesis**
Use some of the same language or ideas in both the thesis and the topic sentence. You don’t have to copy it exactly—just show a clear link.

**2. Echo the Structure of Your Thesis**
If your thesis previews “two reasons” or “two effects,” your body paragraphs should each start with topic sentences about those points, in order.

**3. Use Transitional or Signpost Language**
Words like “Firstly,” “Secondly,” or “Another reason” remind the reader you’re moving through your main points.

---

### **Example:**

**Thesis Statement:**
> “Stricter government laws are essential to protect migrant workers, as they will guarantee fair wages and ensure safer, better working conditions.”

**First Topic Sentence (about wages):**
> “Firstly, stricter government laws are necessary to protect migrant construction workers by ensuring they receive fair wages.”

**Second Topic Sentence (about safety/conditions):**
> “Secondly, stricter regulations will improve the working conditions and safety of migrant workers.”

**How they connect:**
- Both topic sentences restate an element from the thesis (fair wages, better/safer working conditions).
- They keep the focus on “stricter government laws/regulations.”
- Transitional phrases (“Firstly,” “Secondly”) help show order.

---

### **Your turn: Step-by-Step**

1. **Underline** the key ideas in your thesis.
2. **Start your topic sentence** with those ideas (“stricter government laws/regulations,” “protect,” etc.).
3. **State the specific focus** of the paragraph (for example, “fair wages” or “safety”).
4. **Check:** Does someone who reads your topic sentence know exactly which part of the thesis you’re expanding?

---

### **Try it With Your Essay:**

**Thesis:**  
> “Stricter government laws are essential to protect migrant workers, as they will guarantee fair wages and ensure safer, better working conditions.”

**First body paragraph—topic sentence:**  
> “Stricter government laws are necessary to protect migrant construction workers by ensuring they receive fair wages.”

**Second body paragraph—topic sentence:**  
> “Stricter government regulations will improve the working conditions and safety of migrant workers.”

**See how each topic sentence:**
- Uses the main subject of the thesis (“stricter government laws/regulations”)
- Specifies the paragraph’s main point (wages OR working conditions)
- Clearly ties back to the thesis, showing that it supports your overall argument

---

**Summary Table:**

| Thesis Main Point                  | Topic Sentence Focus                 |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| guarantee fair wages               | ensure migrant workers get fair pay  |
| ensure safer, better conditions    | improve working conditions/safety    |
