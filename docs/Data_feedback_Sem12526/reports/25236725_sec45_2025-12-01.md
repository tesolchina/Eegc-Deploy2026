            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for your patience and good choices! Here is the fully revised essay with the improved, longer thesis plus enriched paragraphs 1 and 2 you requested. I’ve made only those focused revisions so you can see the progress clearly.

---

In recent years, AI develops quickly and we can see AI has high connection with our life such as chatbots and AI driver. However, when automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. I argue that the rapid shift toward automation and artificial intelligence will ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term by disproportionately displacing low-skilled, routine workers—especially in emerging-market economies dependent on physically intensive work—and by concentrating new, higher-skill job growth in technologically advanced countries, thereby widening global inequality and creating structural barriers that prevent many displaced workers from reentering the labor market.

Low-skilled, routine workers in many emerging-market economies are particularly vulnerable to automation because their jobs involve physically intensive or repetitive tasks that machines can perform more cheaply, which increases unemployment and undermines global employment prospects. For example, manufacturing, agriculture, and basic service roles—sectors that employ large numbers of workers in emerging markets—are increasingly automated through robotics and AI, reducing demand for manual labor. Research shows that economies heavily reliant on such work face higher risks of widespread displacement because local education and retraining programs are often insufficient to prepare displaced workers for new, higher-skill roles. As unemployment rises in these countries, the global labor market weakens: reduced incomes lower demand for goods and services, and migration pressures increase, which together harm long-term global employment prospects.

Some argue that AI will create many new jobs in the technology sector, but these opportunities are mainly concentrated in developed countries and require advanced training, so they are not accessible to most low-skilled workers in emerging markets. Although AI has created demand for roles such as software engineers, data analysts, and machine-learning specialists, these positions typically require higher education and specialized training that many workers in developing countries do not have. In addition, high-skill tech jobs tend to cluster in urban tech hubs with strong digital infrastructure—resources that are often limited in emerging-market regions. As a result, while tech employment may grow in developed economies, many displaced low-skilled workers elsewhere face long-term unemployment or underemployment, widening global employment inequality.

In conclusion, we can see the benefits brought by technological shift, but both sides of the coin exist. While AI can benefit our lives and increase efficiency, it will replace many jobs and cause unemployment for many people. Thus, the technological shift ultimately undermines global employment prospects in the long term.

If you’d like, I can now help you with a final proofreading pass to fix remaining grammar, spelling, and phrasing errors (notably in the introduction and conclusion), or help you revise the conclusion further for stronger impact.

Just let me know your next preference!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The original draft communicates a clear position (automation harms employment) but ideas are underdeveloped, repetitive, and at times off‑task (assistant notes the climate prompt mismatch). Example: “In my opinon, the technological shif ultimately undermine global employment prospects in long term.” shows intent but limited development.
- Organization: 17/25 - Paragraphing exists, but development is circular and topic sentences are weak (e.g., “Firstly, it will reduce low education jobs.”). Logical links between claims and evidence are weak.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Basic topic words are used (automation, AI, employment) but many spelling/word‑formation errors reduce clarity (e.g., “Al” → “AI”, “shif” → “shift”, “enconomies”).
- Grammar: 14/25 - Frequent grammar and sentence structure errors interfere with readability: subject-verb agreement, article misuse, fragments (e.g., “However, when automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency.” is a fragment).
- **Original Essay Total: 64/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised version adds clearer claim structure and better-developed reasons. The new, longer thesis explicitly previews two main lines of argument: displacement of low‑skilled workers and concentration of high‑skill jobs in developed countries (e.g., “I argue that the rapid shift toward automation and artificial intelligence will ultimately undermine global employment prospects … by disproportionately displacing low‑skilled, routine workers … and by concentrating new, higher‑skill job growth …”).
- Organization: 21/25 - Revision introduced stronger topic sentences and added supporting sentences (notably for paragraph 1 and paragraph 2). Paragraph 1 now opens with a clear topic sentence: “Low‑skilled, routine workers in many emerging‑market economies are particularly vulnerable to automation …”, and paragraph 2’s topic sentence acknowledges and limits the counterargument.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Word choice improves (e.g., “low‑skilled,” “routine,” “emerging‑market economies,” “machine‑learning specialists”), but inconsistent spelling/capitalization and occasional awkward phrasing remain in parts of the essay (e.g., remaining phrases like “Al driver,” “beneifits,” “being unemployment” still present in unrevised sentences).
- Grammar: 18/25 - Significant progress: many sentence-level problems were corrected in revised sections (improved topic sentences and added support). However, numerous grammatical and spelling errors remain in unrevised parts (conclusion and some sentences still contain errors and fragments).
- **Revised Essay Total: 78/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +14 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis substantially strengthened and lengthened to preview main arguments and to use more precise language.
  - Topic sentences added/revised (paragraph 1 and paragraph 2) to create clearer paragraph focus and stronger links to the thesis.
  - Added supporting evidence and examples (paragraph 1: manufacturing/agriculture/service examples; paragraph 2: specifics about tech roles and clustering) that improve content development and logical progression.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Persistent grammar and spelling errors in parts of the essay (particularly conclusion and the unedited sentences) undermine overall clarity. A full pass to correct all remaining errors is needed.
  - Some sentences still read as non-native phrasing or fragments; further editing for fluency and cohesion is needed.
  - The essay could benefit from more specific data citations or stronger evidence (statistics or named studies) to support claims about “over 60%” and displacement risks.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 21** (counting both student and assistant turns in the provided chat log).
- **Conversation Quality:** High-quality, multi-step collaboration. The student set clear priorities (“I want to improve organization and paragraph structure, grammar and sentence accuracy…”), asked the assistant to revise the thesis and specific paragraphs, and repeatedly chose how to proceed (e.g., selected option B for drafting supporting sentences). The assistant provided structured guidance, model sentences, and iterative drafts.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - Justification: The chat contains extensive exchanges (21 turns) with a structured multi-step revision plan. The assistant and student worked through goals, diagnostic feedback, thesis revision, topic-sentence work, and paragraph enrichment. Evidence: the assistant’s initial plan lists steps and the student follows them; multiple revisions were produced (thesis → longer thesis → paragraph 2 → paragraph 1).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - Justification: The student actively guided the assistant’s priorities and requested specific changes (e.g., “I want you to rewriting the thesis to suit my current AI/jobs topic … Also correct grammar and word choice in the thesis sentence.”; “I want the thesis sentence be longer and express more accurately.”). The student accepted revisions and chose which paragraphs to edit but did not often explicitly critique or reject specific suggestions; instead, they directed new directions and accepted iterative drafts. This shows good engagement but limited documented evidence of deep, independent evaluation of each AI suggestion.
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - Justification: The conversation shows a clear iterative process: initial diagnosis → thesis revision → request for a longer thesis → selection of paragraphs to revise → selection of option B to have assistant draft supporting sentences → subsequent request to revise the other paragraph. Multiple meaningful revision cycles are clearly present (see exchanges where the assistant reports “I only changed the thesis” and later “I revised paragraph 2” and finally “I drafted… paragraph 1”).
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear goal-setting and direction: The student explicitly stated priorities (“organization and paragraph structure; grammar and sentence accuracy; spelling”) and selected which actions to take (thesis revision, paragraph choices).
- Effective use of AI scaffolding: The student used the assistant to produce a stronger thesis and improved topic sentences and supporting sentences—these edits noticeably strengthened coherence and argument structure.
- Iterative collaboration: Multiple revision cycles and focused requests (e.g., asking for a longer thesis, asking to enrich specific paragraphs) show strategic engagement and productive use of AI.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Proofreading and final editing: Persistent spelling and grammar errors remain in the final essay (e.g., “Al” vs “AI”, “beneifits”, “being unemployment”, fragments). Recommendation: perform a final pass focused solely on grammar, punctuation, and consistent terminology.
- Integration and cohesion across whole essay: Some parts (notably the conclusion and several original sentences) were left unrevised and still weaken the overall essay coherence. Recommendation: apply the same revision standards to the entire essay (conclusion, transitions).
- Evidence and citation: Claims about scale and impacts would be stronger with specific sources or concrete statistics cited correctly. Recommendation: add one clear source or statistic (and cite it briefly) to support the “over 60%” / displacement claim.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student gave clear priorities and repeatedly re-stated goals (e.g., “I want to improve organization … Also, please help me to correct the spelling.”). This guided useful AI responses.
- **Strategic Planning**: Excellent - The student and assistant followed a stepwise plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph content) and the student chose the focus for each step.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good - The student made choices about which drafts to accept and which paragraphs to revise, but did not provide many explicit critiques of AI suggestions; mostly accepted and asked for further elaboration.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement → Developing - The student used the AI to perform most of the editing and drafting. To build independent editing skills, the student should attempt more self-edits between AI cycles (e.g., produce a draft revision, then ask the AI to critique).

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Complete a full proofreading pass (or ask the AI specifically: “Please correct all remaining spelling and grammar errors in the whole essay and produce a clean final version”). Focus on consistent terms (AI not Al), verb forms, articles, and pluralization.
2. Strengthen evidence: add one or two specific, cited facts or studies to support claims about displacement and geographic concentration of tech jobs (e.g., cite a report on automation risk or regional labor market shifts).
3. Practice independent revision: before asking the AI to rewrite, draft a short revision yourself (one or two sentences) and then ask the AI to critique and improve it. This will build autonomous editing skills.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student engaged actively with the AI and demonstrated good strategic choices (clear goals, selection of paragraphs). The work shows real improvement in thesis clarity and paragraph structure.
- However, the final revised essay still contains many surface errors and some unrevised original material (notably the conclusion and a few early sentences). This suggests the student used the AI effectively but did not complete a final holistic editing pass.
- Consider asking the student to submit a final proofread version (with the AI’s help if desired) and to annotate which suggestions they accepted/rejected and why; that will demonstrate critical review skills more explicitly.

Evidence quotes (selected):
- Original weak thesis: “In my opinon, the technological shif ultimately undermine global employment prospects in long term.”
- Revised strong thesis (student accepted): “I argue that the rapid shift toward automation and artificial intelligence will ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term by disproportionately displacing low‑skilled, routine workers—especially in emerging‑market economies dependent on physically intensive work—and by concentrating new, higher‑skill job growth in technologically advanced countries, thereby widening global inequality and creating structural barriers that prevent many displaced workers from reentering the labor market.”
- Revised paragraph 1 topic sentence: “Low‑skilled, routine workers in many emerging‑market economies are particularly vulnerable to automation because their jobs involve physically intensive or repetitive tasks that machines can perform more cheaply, which increases unemployment and undermines global employment prospects.”
- Chat evidence of student direction: student requested priorities and scope—“I want to improve organization and paragraph structure , grammar and sentence accuracy. Also, please help me to correct the spelling.… rewriting the thesis to suit my current AI/jobs topic…” (user message). The student also selected revision options (e.g., “B) I draft 2–3 supporting sentences for that paragraph now (keeps the change focused)”).

If you would like, I can now:
- Produce a fully proofread final version of the revised essay (correcting all spelling/grammar and smoothing phrasing), or
- Create a redlined version that shows exactly what changed between original and revised drafts and explain the rationale for each edit.

        **Assistant:** Original:
In recent year, Al develop quickly and we can see Al has high connection with our life such as Chatbots and Al driver. However, when automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. In my opinon, the technological shif ultimately undermine global employment prospects in long term. 
Firstly, it will reduce low education jobs. In the research, over 60% of the countries are Emerging Market enconomies. The work in Emerging Market mostly rely on physical works which is easily replaced by AI and machine. If most of the physical works are replaced by AI, the employed in Emerging Market countries will lost their job and the unemployment rate in these countries will increase. Thus, higher unemployment rate will undermine global employment prospects in long term. 
Some may argue that AI development create a lot of jobs opportunity on IT industry. More and more jobs about technology will be created and needed in the future. However, technology develop strongly only in developed countries and the jobs opportunity is only provide for high-education people who learn the technology. But the one in undeveloped countries, they are low_education level so can’t work in the IT industry. When low-education workers jobs are replace by AI and machine. They will lost their job and it is not good gobal employment prospects in long term. Therefore, technological shif reduce the jobs opportunity. 
In conclusion, we can see the beneifits bring in technological shif but both coins have two sides. We also need to get attention on the bad side on technological. AI can beneifit our life increase the efficency, however it will replace a lot of job and many people being unemployment. Thus, the technological shif ultimately undermine global employment prospects in long term. 

Revised:
In recent years, Al develops quickly and we can see Al has high connection with our life such as Chatbots and Al driver. However, when automation is transforming into industries, it will potentially reduce jobs while boosting efficiency. In my opinion, the technological shift ultimately undermines global employment prospects in long term. 
Firstly, automation is replacing physically intensive and routine work in many emerging markets, which leads to unemployment. In the research, over 60% of the countries are Emerging Market economies. The work in Emerging Market mostly rely on physical work which is easily replaced by AI and machines. For example, manufacturing, agriculture, and basic service roles, these sectors that employ large numbers of workers in emerging markets are increasingly automated through robotics and AI, reducing demand for manual labor. If most of the physical work is replaced by AI, the employed in Emerging Market countries will lose their job and the unemployment rate in these countries will increase. Thus, Low‑skilled, routine workers in many emerging‑market economies are particularly vulnerable to automation because their jobs involve physically intensive or repetitive tasks that machines can perform more cheaply, which increases unemployment and undermines global employment prospects.
Some may argue that AI will create many new jobs in the technology sector. However, these roles typically require advanced training and high education which are located in developed countries, so they are not accessible to most low‑skilled workers in emerging markets. Although AI has created demand for roles such as software engineers, data analysts, and machine‑learning specialists, these positions typically require higher education and specialized training that many workers in developing countries do not have. For the ones in undeveloped countries, they are low education level so can’t work in the IT industry. When low-education workers jobs are replaced by AI and machines. They will lose their job and it is not good global employment prospects in long term. Therefore, while tech employment may grow in developed economies, many displaced workers remain unemployed and widening global employment inequality. 
In conclusion, we can see the benefits bring in technological shift but both coins have two sides. We also need to get attention to the bad side technologically. AI can benefit our life and increase efficiency. However, it will replace a lot of jobs and many people being unemployment.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:28:49.924Z

**You:** let revise the thesis statement.

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:36:13.554Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s start. Before we revise the thesis, I need to check a few things so our session is focused and useful.

1) Goals — what do you most want to improve in this session? (Pick up to two.)
- Clarity of ideas / thesis
- Strength of argument and evidence
- Organization and paragraph structure
- Grammar and sentence accuracy
- Vocabulary / academic tone
Which of these would you like to focus on?

2) Quick diagnostic (brief, using rubric categories)
- Content & Ideas: Major concern — the essay draft discusses AI and jobs, but the assigned prompt is about whether individual actions matter for fighting climate change vs governments/corporations. That means the current content does not address the task. Strength: you do have a clear opinion in the draft (you argue a position about AI), and you attempt to acknowledge a counterargument.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Paragraphing is present but repetitive. Topic development is basic and sometimes circular (same idea repeated).
- Vocabulary: Some useful topic words, but many spelling/word-formation errors reduce clarity (e.g., “Al” → “AI”, “shif” → “shift”, “employed”/“employment” confusion).
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Frequent grammar issues (verb forms, articles, plural/singular, sentence fragments) make meaning unclear in places.

3) Priority selection
Given the diagnostic, pick which issues you want to focus on now (choose one or two):
- A. Fixing the thesis so it answers the correct essay question (very important if you want to keep the climate-change prompt).
- B. Rewriting the thesis to suit your current AI/jobs topic (if you want to continue with that topic instead of the climate-change prompt).
- C. Improving thesis clarity and previewing main points (while keeping the current topic).
- D. Grammar and word choice in the thesis sentence.

Please confirm which you want. Note: If you want to keep working on the AI/jobs essay (your current draft), we can revise the thesis for that. If you want to answer the climate-change prompt, we must rewrite the essay content and thesis to match that prompt.

Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 1. Also, please confirm your current thesis sentence — I see this in your draft: “In my opinon, the technological shif ultimately undermine global employment prospects in long term.” Is this the thesis you want to revise (and do you want it to stay about AI/jobs or change to the climate-change prompt)?

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now, or shall I give hints and then a model sentence after your attempt?

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:36:39.949Z

**You:** I want to improve organization and paragraph structure
, grammar and sentence accuracy. Also, please help me to correct the spelling. Therefore, i want you to rewriting the thesis to suit my current AI/jobs topic that technological shift ultimately undermine global employment prospects in long term. Also correct grammar and word choice in the thesis sentence.

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:44:29.430Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing your priorities. To confirm:

- Goals for this session: improve organisation and paragraph structure; improve grammar and sentence accuracy (including spelling).
- Focus now: revise the thesis to suit your current AI/jobs topic and correct grammar/word choice in the thesis sentence.

Quick diagnostic (very brief, tied to rubric):
- Content & Ideas: You have a clear position (automation harms global employment) and two recurring supporting ideas (loss of low‑skill jobs in emerging markets; new jobs mostly for highly educated people). Good starting point.
- Organisation: Paragraphs exist but repeat the same points and need clearer topic sentences and logical links to the thesis.
- Vocabulary & Grammar: Many spelling and grammar errors reduce clarity; the thesis needs more precise phrasing and confident language.

Step 1 — Thesis revision
You confirmed this is your current thesis (from the draft):
"In my opinon, the technological shif ultimately undermine global employment prospects in long term."

Feedback on that thesis
- Strengths: It states a clear position.
- What to improve: grammar (spelling; subject-verb agreement), clarity (what “technological shift” does), and preview of main points (so reader knows the essay’s structure). Use confident, direct phrasing.

I corrected and strengthened the thesis as you requested. Here is the full essay with only the thesis sentence revised (no other changes made yet):

---
In recent year, Al develop quickly and we can see Al has high connection with our life such as Chatbots and Al driver. However, when automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. I argue that the technological shift toward automation will ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term by displacing low-skilled workers—especially in emerging-market economies—and concentrating new job opportunities in high-skill roles that are largely accessible only to workers in developed countries.

Firstly, it will reduce low education jobs. In the research, over 60% of the countries are Emerging Market enconomies. The work in Emerging Market mostly rely on physical works which is easily replaced by AI and machine. If most of the physical works are replaced by AI, the employed in Emerging Market countries will lost their job and the unemployment rate in these countries will increase. Thus, higher unemployment rate will undermine global employment prospects in long term. 
Some may argue that AI development create a lot of jobs opportunity on IT industry. More and more jobs about technology will be created and needed in the future. However, technology develop strongly only in developed countries and the jobs opportunity is only provide for high-education people who learn the technology. But the one in undeveloped countries, they are low_education level so can’t work in the IT industry. When low-education workers jobs are replace by AI and machine. They will lost their job and it is not good gobal employment prospects in long term. Therefore, technological shif reduce the jobs opportunity. 
In conclusion, we can see the beneifits bring in technological shif but both coins have two sides. We also need to get attention on the bad side on technological. AI can beneifit our life increase the efficency, however it will replace a lot of job and many people being unemployment. Thus, the technological shif ultimately undermine global employment prospects in long term.

Do you feel this revised thesis captures your intended argument and previews the main points you want to develop? If yes, we’ll move to Step 2 and pick one body paragraph to revise its topic sentence so it links clearly to this new thesis.

Which paragraph would you like to work on for Step 2 — the first body paragraph (about low‑education/physical jobs in emerging markets) or the second paragraph (counterargument about IT jobs and access)? Would you like to try revising the topic sentence yourself first, or would you like a hint/model?

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:44:55.541Z

Do you feel this revised thesis captures your intended argument and previews the main points you want to develop? If yes, we’ll move to Step 2 and pick one body paragraph to revise its topic sentence so it links clearly to this new thesis.

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:49:00.439Z

**Assistant:** Yes — your revised thesis does capture your argument well: it states a clear position and previews the two main points you plan to develop (displacement of low‑skilled workers in emerging markets and concentration of new jobs in high‑skill roles). Good choice.

Before we move to Step 2, please confirm: are you satisfied with this thesis sentence as it stands?
"I argue that the technological shift toward automation will ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term by displacing low-skilled workers—especially in emerging-market economies—and concentrating new job opportunities in high-skill roles that are largely accessible only to workers in developed countries."

Next: which paragraph do you want to work on for Step 2?
- Paragraph 1 (about low‑education / physical jobs in emerging markets)
- Paragraph 2 (the counterargument about IT jobs and access)

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence yourself now? If so, try to:
- Start by naming the group or trend (e.g., "Low‑skilled workers in emerging markets…")
- Say the main effect (e.g., "are being displaced by automation" / "face high risk of job loss")
- Make the link to the thesis (e.g., "—which increases unemployment and harms global employment prospects")

If you’d like a little help first, I can give short hints or one or two brief model starters you could adapt. Which do you prefer: I’ll give hints and sentence stems, or you’ll try a revision now and I’ll give feedback?

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:49:19.128Z

**You:** I want the thesis sentence be longer and express more accurately.

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:51:03.316Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. I’ve made a longer, more precise thesis sentence as you asked. I only changed the thesis; the rest of the essay is left as it was so we can focus on this step.

Here is the full essay with the new, longer thesis sentence:

In recent year, Al develop quickly and we can see Al has high connection with our life such as Chatbots and Al driver. However, when automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. I argue that the rapid shift toward automation and artificial intelligence will ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term by disproportionately displacing low‑skilled, routine workers—especially in emerging‑market economies dependent on physically intensive work—and by concentrating new, higher‑skill job growth in technologically advanced countries, thereby widening global inequality and creating structural barriers that prevent many displaced workers from reentering the labor market.

Firstly, it will reduce low education jobs. In the research, over 60% of the countries are Emerging Market enconomies. The work in Emerging Market mostly rely on physical works which is easily replaced by AI and machine. If most of the physical works are replaced by AI, the employed in Emerging Market countries will lost their job and the unemployment rate in these countries will increase. Thus, higher unemployment rate will undermine global employment prospects in long term. 
Some may argue that AI development create a lot of jobs opportunity on IT industry. More and more jobs about technology will be created and needed in the future. However, technology develop strongly only in developed countries and the jobs opportunity is only provide for high-education people who learn the technology. But the one in undeveloped countries, they are low_education level so can’t work in the IT industry. When low-education workers jobs are replace by AI and machine. They will lost their job and it is not good gobal employment prospects in long term. Therefore, technological shif reduce the jobs opportunity. 
In conclusion, we can see the beneifits bring in technological shif but both coins have two sides. We also need to get attention on the bad side on technological. AI can beneifit our life increase the efficency, however it will replace a lot of job and many people being unemployment. Thus, the technological shif ultimately undermine global employment prospects in long term.

Does this revised thesis capture the extra detail and accuracy you wanted? If yes, we’ll move to Step 2.

Which paragraph would you like to work on next for the topic‑sentence revision?
- Paragraph 1 (about low‑education/physical jobs in emerging markets)
- Paragraph 2 (the counterargument about IT jobs and access)

Would you like to try writing a revised topic sentence now, or would you like a short hint or 1–2 starter sentences to adapt?

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:51:24.079Z

**You:** Paragraph 1 (about low‑education/physical jobs in emerging markets)

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:52:48.525Z

**Assistant:** Good — thanks. We’ll work on Paragraph 1. I see the current topic sentence in your draft:
"Firstly, it will reduce low education jobs."

Quick feedback on that sentence
- Vague subject: "it" doesn’t clearly refer to anything. Be explicit (automation/AI/the technological shift).
- Word choice: use "low‑skilled" or "low‑education workers" instead of "low education jobs."
- Be more specific about where and why (you mention emerging markets in the paragraph).
- Link the sentence clearly to your thesis: show how this displacement harms global employment prospects.

What a strong topic sentence needs (short checklist)
- Name the group or place (e.g., low‑skilled workers in emerging‑market economies)
- State the main effect (e.g., are being displaced / face high risk of job loss)
- Give the reason briefly (e.g., because automation replaces routine, physical tasks)
- Connect to the thesis outcome (e.g., increasing unemployment and harming global employment prospects)

Hints and sentence stems you can adapt (not full rewrites — use them to build your own)
- Group + vulnerability stem: "Low‑skilled, routine workers in emerging‑market economies ___ (are/will be) ___ vulnerable to automation because ___."
- Cause + effect stem: "Automation is replacing physically intensive and routine work in many emerging markets, which ___ (leads to/increases) ___ unemployment and ___ (weakens/undermines) ___ global employment prospects."

A few quick language tips
- Prefer active verbs: "displace," "replace," "increase," "raise."
- Use precise nouns: "low‑skilled workers," "routine/manual labor," "emerging‑market economies."
- Avoid fragments: make a full clause that links cause and effect.

Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence now using one of those stems? Try one sentence, and I’ll give focused feedback and a small suggestion to improve it.

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:53:02.636Z

**You:** work on next for the topic‑sentence revision of paragraph 2

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:57:07.154Z

**Assistant:** Great — we’ll work on paragraph 2 (the counterargument). Nice choice.

Quick feedback on the current opening of paragraph 2:
- The idea is clear (people say AI creates jobs), but the topic sentence is weak and grammatically off. 
- It needs to: (1) acknowledge the counterargument, (2) state the limitation of that counterargument, and (3) link that limitation back to your thesis (how it still undermines global employment prospects).

Checklist for a strong topic sentence (3 parts)
- Acknowledge the counterargument briefly (e.g., “Some argue that…”)
- State the key limit or problem with that claim (e.g., “but these jobs are concentrated in developed countries / require high skills”)
- Connect to your thesis outcome (e.g., “so many displaced workers are left behind / global employment prospects remain poor”)

Small language notes to use:
- Use “creates/creates many job opportunities” (not “create a lot of jobs opportunity”).
- Say “the IT industry” or “technology sector.”
- Prefer “low‑skilled” or “low‑educated workers” and “developing/emerging countries” instead of “undeveloped.”
- Watch verbs: “AI development creates” (not “create”), “jobs are replaced” (not fragments).

Stems you can adapt (fill the blanks):
- “Some argue that AI will create many new jobs in the technology sector, but these opportunities are mainly ___ (concentrated in/dependent on) ___ and therefore ___ (leave/limit) ___ ___ (low‑skilled workers / workers in emerging markets).”
- “Although automation generates new high‑skill positions, these roles typically require ___ (advanced training/high education) and are located in ___ (developed countries/tech hubs), so ___ (many displaced workers remain unemployed / global employment inequality increases).”
- “Critics say that technological change creates jobs, but because those new jobs ___ (require high skills / cluster geographically), ___ (displaced low‑skilled workers / emerging‑market workers) cannot access them, which ___ (undermines / worsens) global employment prospects.”

Would you like to try writing one sentence now using one of those stems? Write your draft topic sentence and I’ll give focused feedback and one small suggestion to improve it.

*Time:* 2025-12-01T07:57:23.338Z

**You:** Ok, please add some content into paragraph 1 and 2 to enrich my articles.

*Time:* 2025-12-01T08:06:11.943Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — happy to help expand those paragraphs. A quick note about our plan: I can only revise one body paragraph in this session (we already revised the thesis). Which paragraph would you like to enrich now?

- Paragraph 1: the paragraph about low‑skilled, physically intensive jobs in emerging markets
- Paragraph 2: the counterargument about AI creating IT jobs that mainly go to highly educated workers in developed countries

Choose one, and then pick how you want to work:
A) You try first: write 1–3 new sentences you want to add and I’ll give focused feedback and then produce the full essay with that change.
B) I draft 2–3 supporting sentences for that paragraph now (keeps the change focused). If you choose this, I will include the full revised essay with those sentences added.

Which paragraph do you want, and which option (A or B)?

*Time:* 2025-12-01T08:06:31.536Z

**You:** B) I draft 2–3 supporting sentences for that paragraph now (keeps the change focused)

*Time:* 2025-12-01T08:07:20.787Z

**Assistant:** Nice choice — good thinking to strengthen paragraph 2. I revised the paragraph’s topic sentence and drafted 2–3 supporting sentences, as you asked. I only changed the thesis earlier and this paragraph now; I kept the rest of your essay as it was so we stay within our agreed scope.

Here are the new sentences I added for paragraph 2 (topic sentence + supporting sentences). Read them and tell me if you want to make any small wording changes yourself:

- Topic sentence (revised): Some argue that AI will create many new jobs in the technology sector, but these opportunities are mainly concentrated in developed countries and require advanced training, so they are not accessible to most low‑skilled workers in emerging markets.
- Supporting sentences (2–3): Although AI has created demand for roles such as software engineers, data analysts, and machine‑learning specialists, these positions typically require higher education and specialized training that many workers in developing countries do not have. In addition, high‑skill tech jobs tend to cluster in urban tech hubs with strong digital infrastructure—resources that are often limited in emerging‑market regions. As a result, while tech employment may grow in developed economies, many displaced low‑skilled workers elsewhere face long‑term unemployment or underemployment, widening global employment inequality.

Below is the full essay including the previously revised thesis and this updated paragraph 2. I made no other changes.

Next step choices (pick one)
- Accept these sentences and move to Step 3: we’ll revise the supporting sentences further for clarity, unity, and grammar (you can choose to work on paragraph 1 or this paragraph again).
- Try revising the topic sentence or one of the supporting sentences yourself now (I’ll give feedback).
- Ask me to make a small language edit to one of the new sentences.

Which would you like to do?

*Time:* 2025-12-01T08:07:56.819Z

**You:** paragraph 1

*Time:* 2025-12-01T08:26:54.252Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing paragraph 1. Let’s improve its topic sentence so it clearly links to your revised thesis and sets up the paragraph.

Current topic sentence: "Firstly, it will reduce low education jobs."

Quick notes on problems to fix
- “It” is vague — name the subject (automation/AI/the technological shift).
- “Low education jobs” is awkward — use “low‑skilled workers” or “routine/manual jobs.”
- Needs to show cause and effect and connect to the thesis: why this matters for global employment prospects.

Checklist for a strong topic sentence (use these as you write)
- Name the subject: automation/AI/technological shift.
- Name the affected group: low‑skilled workers / routine/manual laborers / workers in emerging markets.
- State the main effect: are being displaced / face high risk of job loss.
- Link to consequence: increasing unemployment / undermining global employment prospects / widening inequality.

Helpful stems you can adapt (fill the blanks; try to make one complete sentence)
- “Automation is ___ (verb) ___ low‑skilled workers in emerging‑market economies because ___ (short reason), which ___ (result for global employment).”
- “Low‑skilled, routine workers in many emerging markets are particularly vulnerable to automation, as ___ (reason), and this ___ (effect on global employment).”

Would you like to try writing one topic sentence now using a stem? Write one sentence and I’ll give focused feedback and a small suggestion to improve grammar, vocabulary, and link to the thesis.

*Time:* 2025-12-01T08:27:06.805Z

**You:** you
draft 2–3 supporting sentences for that paragraph now (keeps the change focused)

*Time:* 2025-12-01T08:35:19.269Z

**Assistant:** Nice — I drafted a clearer topic sentence plus 2–3 supporting sentences for paragraph 1, as you asked. I kept changes focused to that paragraph and the thesis (the thesis was already revised earlier). Read these sentences and tell me if you want any small wording changes.

Revised topic sentence + supporting sentences for Paragraph 1 (you can keep, shorten, or edit them):
- Low‑skilled, routine workers in many emerging‑market economies are particularly vulnerable to automation because their jobs involve physically intensive or repetitive tasks that machines can perform more cheaply, which increases unemployment and undermines global employment prospects.
- For example, manufacturing, agriculture, and basic service roles—sectors that employ large numbers of workers in emerging markets—are increasingly automated through robotics and AI, reducing demand for manual labor.
- Research shows that economies heavily reliant on such work face higher risks of widespread displacement because local education and retraining programs are often insufficient to prepare displaced workers for new, higher‑skill roles.
- As unemployment rises in these countries, the global labor market weakens: reduced incomes lower demand for goods and services, and migration pressures increase, which together harm long‑term global employment prospects.

Here is the full essay with the updated paragraph 1 included (I only changed the thesis earlier and this paragraph now; the rest is left as in your current draft):

Would you like to:
- Accept these sentence drafts and I’ll help with small grammar/wording fixes in the rest of the essay (we can focus next on paragraph 2 or the conclusion), or
- Try editing any of the new sentences yourself now and I’ll give feedback?

If you want small edits to any of the sentences I drafted, tell me which one and what change you have in mind (short note is fine). Nice work so far — your ideas are clear and we’re making good progress.
