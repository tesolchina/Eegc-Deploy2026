### INSTRUCTOR NOTES

- Student has not completed required revision tasks; placeholders ("bla bla bla") do not demonstrate learning.
- Recommend scheduling follow-up to ensure student understands the importance of genuine revision and AI collaboration.
- Further support may be required to help student move from simulation to real improvement tasks.

---

**Note:** This training session was procedural rather than substantive. Student needs to actually perform revision tasks for meaningful progress in both essay writing and AI-collaboration skills.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:01:31.842Z

**You:** Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

**Assistant:** Great! Thank you for sharing your draft and thesis statement. Let’s begin with **Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**.

**Your Current Thesis Statement:**
> “Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”

### Feedback:
- **Clarity**: The thesis is fairly clear, but the sentence is long and could be more direct.
- **Strength**: “I partly agree with this idea because I believe…” is a bit hesitant. For academic writing, it’s better to use confident language.
- **Focus on Essay Question**: The thesis does address the question about individual actions vs. governments/companies, which is great!
- **Preview of Structure**: You mention both government influence and personal choices—these seem to be your main points.
- **Language**: Consider avoiding “I believe,” “I think,” or “at the same time” to make your argument sound more assertive and academic.

### Suggestions to Improve:
- Try clearly stating your position and previewing both of your main points.
- Use confident language.
- Keep your sentence focused and not overly complex.

**You:** Let’s pretend that we’ve revise the thesis statement.
Bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:20:09.363Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s imagine you’ve revised your thesis statement after reflecting on my feedback.

Just to confirm, are you satisfied with the new version of your thesis statement?  
(You can paste your revised thesis here, or ask for one more hint if needed!)

**Once you’re happy with your thesis, let’s move to Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision.**

Which body paragraph would you like to work on for improving its topic sentence—  
the first paragraph about *citizens influencing government*  
or the second paragraph about *individual lifestyle choices*?

Please copy the topic sentence of the paragraph you’d like to revise, and I’ll share feedback to help you make sure it clearly connects to your updated thesis.

**You:** Let’s pretend we’ve revise the topic sentence, body paragraph.

**You:** Let’s pretend we’ve revise the topic sentence, body paragraph. Bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:42:02.125Z

**Assistant:** Perfect, let’s continue our structured revision using the three-step process!

## Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision

You’ve provided this thesis statement:
> “Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”

**Feedback on your current thesis:**
- **Clarity:** The main points are clear, but the sentence is a bit long and uses some uncertain language ("I partly agree", "I believe").
- **Strength:** Phrases like “I believe” and “partly agree” make it softer than it could be. For academic tone, stronger, more direct language works better.
- **Focus:** You address both the influence of citizens on government and the value of personal choices—this is a good preview of your body points!
- **Structure Preview:** Nice job mentioning both main points! Try to signal them even more clearly.
- **Language:** Phrases such as “at the same time” and “while less impactful” are fine, but see if you can use more precise academic language.

**Quick suggestions:**
- State your position directly and avoid hedging language.
- Clearly preview the arguments for both government influence and personal responsibility.
- Try to write the thesis in one focused, confident sentence.

Would you like to try revising your thesis now?  
If you want a hint, try starting with:  
“Although actions by governments and companies are essential for combating climate change, individual citizens play a significant role by influencing policy and adopting sustainable lifestyles.”  
But don’t feel you have to copy this! Try your own version first, if you prefer.

## Next Steps

Once you’re happy with your new thesis, please share it here and confirm you’re satisfied.  
Then, tell me which body paragraph (1 or 2) you’d like to revise the topic sentence for.  
When you’re ready, copy and paste that topic sentence. I’ll give you feedback and help you revise it to make sure it matches your new thesis!

Ready when you are!
