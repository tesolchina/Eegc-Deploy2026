### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Summary:  
- Total Exchanges: 15  
- The AI assistant provided structured, scaffolded, and pedagogically sound prompts asking the student to paste revised thesis and topic sentences for focused feedback.  
- The student repeatedly responded with “let’s pretend” phrases, refusing to supply concrete revised text.  
- This resulted in a high volume of turns but very low depth, no substantive student input, and no actual revision cycles.  

#### Detailed Interaction Scores:  
- **In-Depth Conversation:** 2/5  
  - Despite many turns, the conversation lacks content depth due to absence of student-generated revisions.  
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions:** 1/5  
  - No evidence the student engaged with or evaluated AI recommendations.  
- **Refining Process:** 1/5  
  - No iterative revisions by the student; AI repeatedly requested but student deferred.  

- **Overall Human-AI Interaction Score:** 4/15 (Needs substantial improvement)  

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY  

#### Strengths:  
- Initial essay draft demonstrates a clear stance and coherent supporting ideas.  
- AI assistance was well-structured and clear in guiding student through stepwise revision.  

#### Areas for Improvement:  
- Student must actively engage by producing actual revisions rather than “pretending.”  
- Grammar, vocabulary, and clarity should be improved by focusing on sentence-level edits.  
- Refinement of thesis and topic sentences is necessary to clarify argument structure.  
- Provide concrete examples or data to strengthen argument depth and persuasiveness.  
- Respond substantively to AI prompts to enable productive revision cycles.  

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:  
- **Context Provision:** Needs Improvement — Student did not provide revised texts when asked.  
- **Strategic Planning:** Needs Improvement — Did not follow stepwise AI-guided revision process.  
- **Critical Evaluation:** Needs Improvement — Student did not accept, reject, or explain AI suggestions.  
- **Independent Editing:** Needs Improvement — No evidence of independent revision based on feedback.  

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT  

1. **Follow the stepwise revision process:**  
   - Paste a concise revised thesis statement (one sentence).  
   - Revise topic sentences aligned with the thesis.  
   - Edit full paragraphs progressively for clarity and correctness.  

2. **Focus on sentence-level corrections:**  
   - Improve verb forms, subject-verb agreement, article use, and eliminate fragments.  
   - Clarify sentence logic and relationships with better transitions.  

3. **Enhance argument clarity and persuasiveness:**  
   - Make thesis concise and precise, previewing main points clearly.  
   - Use topic sentences that reflect the thesis and organize paragraph content accordingly.  
   - Support claims with concrete examples or brief statistics.  

4. **Engage critically with AI suggestions:**  
   - Evaluate each recommendation and provide feedback to guide assistant’s help.  
   - If disagreeing, explain rationale briefly to enable tailored guidance.  

5. **Iterate revisions:**  
   - Complete multiple rounds of revision (post new text → get feedback → edit again).  
   - Use each cycle to refine clarity, coherence, vocabulary, and grammar.  

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES  

- The student’s initial writing shows potential but stalled due to lack of active revision engagement.  
- The assistant’s scaffolded approach was pedagogically sound but thwarted by the student’s refusal to provide concrete revised text.  
- For formative follow-up, require the student submit:  
  - One revised concise thesis sentence, and  
  - One revised topic sentence, followed by  
  - A fully revised draft paragraph, enabling measurable progress and mentoring through iterations.  

This approach will better demonstrate the student’s ability to apply AI-assisted revision guidance and improve writing skills iteratively.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 19/25 - The essay states a clear balanced position (partial agreement) and gives two relevant supporting lines of argument (influencing government; personal lifestyle change). Examples are general but relevant (“people protest or vote…ban pollution or invest in clean energy”; “buy from green companies”). Development is basic rather than deep.
- Organization: 20/25 - The essay has a recognizable structure (intro, two body paragraphs, conclusion) and logical progression from general claim to two supporting points. Paragraph-level coherence is adequate but transitions and internal sentence logic are weak in places.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Language is simple and mostly appropriate, with some repetition and limited variety. There are some awkward collocations and word choices (e.g., “normal people,” “this is problem”).
- Grammar: 16/25 - Frequent grammatical and phrasing errors reduce clarity (see examples below), but meaning is still recoverable overall.
- **Original Essay Total: 73/100**

Justification evidence (original):
- Thesis sentence: "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play." — clear stance but wordy.
- Example errors: "But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well." / "nothing happen." / "so this is problem."

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 19/25 - The revised essay submitted is textually identical to the original; content strengths and limits remain the same.
- Organization: 20/25 - Structure unchanged from the original.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - No observable vocabulary improvement.
- Grammar: 16/25 - Grammatical issues remain unchanged.
- **Revised Essay Total: 73/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None — the revised essay is identical to the original draft; no concrete revisions to thesis, topic sentence, or body paragraphs were made.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Revise the thesis to be more concise and preview structure more clearly (e.g., avoid hedging phrases such as “I also think”).
  - Edit grammar and sentence structure (remove fragments, correct verb forms, improve subject-verb agreement).
  - Strengthen evidence and explanation with a specific case or statistic and smoother transitions between claims.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 15** (counting each user and assistant message in the transcript)
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided structured guidance and repeated prompts requesting the student to paste or confirm a revised thesis and topic sentence. The student repeatedly responded with “let’s pretend we have revised …” and did not supply actual revised content. This means the conversation contains many turns but little substantive student contribution or acceptance of AI suggestions.

Representative chat evidence:
- Assistant request: "Please paste the single sentence you are using as your thesis…" (multiple prompts asking for a concrete thesis)
- Student responses (examples): "let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement" / "let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentence and move on" / "let’s pretend we have revised the rest of essay and move on bla bla blah"

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 - Although there are many turns (15), the depth is low because the student did not supply revised text or substantive questions. Most of the dialog is assistant prompting; the student repeatedly deferred actual revision work ("let's pretend..."), so the exchange lacked meaningful iterative content from the student.
  - Evidence: Repeated student lines "let's pretend..." rather than pasting revisions or attempting rewrites.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 - The student did not evaluate or accept/reject specific AI suggestions in an evidence-based way. There is no record of the student saying which AI recommendations they would keep or change.
  - Evidence: The assistant offered revision guidance and an explicit alternative thesis to “Use this,” but the student never confirmed or critiqued those suggestions.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 - No real iterations of revision by the student are visible. The assistant repeatedly requested a concrete thesis or topic sentence to revise; the student did not produce revised versions to iterate on.
  - Evidence: Multiple assistant prompts asking the student to paste a revised thesis/topic sentence; student replies declined to provide changes.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 4/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student produced an intelligible initial draft with a clear overall stance and two coherent supporting ideas (evidence: the thesis line and the two body paragraphs’ focuses).
- The assistant’s guidance was structured and pedagogically helpful (prompts that clearly outline required steps: confirm thesis, then revise topic sentence, then paragraph).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- The student must produce actual revisions and engage directly with AI suggestions. Repeatedly saying “let’s pretend” prevents progress.
- Grammar and sentence-level editing are needed: fix verb forms, add articles, and resolve sentence fragments (examples: "maybe just listen", "so is not always working well", "nothing happen").
- Strengthen and tighten argumentation: make the thesis concise, provide clearer topic sentences aligned to the thesis, and add at least one concrete example or data point to support claims.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student provided the original essay but did not supply a revised thesis or topic sentence when prompted, limiting the assistant's ability to act.
  - Evidence: Student did not paste a revised thesis despite multiple assistant prompts.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The student did not follow the assistant’s requested stepwise process (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) and therefore did not demonstrate planning through iterations.
  - Evidence: Assistant repeatedly requested confirmation of thesis; student kept deferring.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - No recorded evaluation of AI suggestions; the student did not accept, reject, or adapt suggestions meaningfully.
  - Evidence: Absence of comments such as “I accept this” or “I disagree because…”.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - No evidence of the student performing independent edits after AI feedback.
  - Evidence: Revised essay is identical to original and chat shows no student-supplied revisions.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Complete the required steps: paste a concise revised thesis sentence (one sentence), then paste a topic sentence to revise, then paste a full paragraph to edit. Follow the assistant’s stepwise instructions.
2. Focus on sentence-level editing: correct verb forms (“happen” → “happen(s)/happened”), subject-verb agreement, and article use; break long or run-on sentences into clearer units.
3. Improve argument depth: tighten the thesis (concise stance + preview), make topic sentences clearly reflect the thesis, and add one concrete example or statistic with a short explanation to strengthen claims.
4. In AI collaborations, respond to specific prompts. If you disagree with an AI suggestion, explain why (e.g., “I don’t like this word because…”) so the assistant can adapt helpfully.
5. Iterate: perform at least two explicit revision cycles (student produces a revision, AI gives feedback, student revises again) to demonstrate refining process.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student produced an initial coherent draft but did not engage in the revision tasks required by the module. The chat shows the assistant provided explicit, scaffolded instructions for a stepwise revision process; however, the student repeatedly chose not to supply revised content and instead used “let’s pretend” replies that prevent measurable progress.
- For grading or formative follow-up, request the student to return with a single revised thesis sentence and one revised topic sentence (actual text), then a revised paragraph, so the AI-assistant process can be properly assessed for iterative improvement and critical engagement.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T04:00:42.192Z

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T03:46:24.686Z

**You:** I think government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their right.
  Here are two reason to support the answer,the first is that everyone have the same right。It is because of everyone give a small part of their rights, so government have this power.if people’s right is hurt,government should enforce laws to protect human’s right in the long-run.the overall unemployment rate is high.the information is an evident for that the labor is used inefficient.government should enforce laws to decrease overall unemployment rate and this behavior will increase the gross domestic production.
  However,his behavior also have risks in short-run.first,we should to do enough research to make a law,if we make a wrong law,it will hurt worker more than before.second,government’s money and resources is limited if we make a law and do it,it  will cost huge money.this behavior will increase the goverment’s pressure.also,it maybe have another result.the result is that people will give more to government.
  In general,government should focus on the benefit in long-run.if government don’t protect right because of the short of money,this logic is totally wrong.government isn’t a company,they should ave responsibility to protect right and decrease the overall unempolyment rate to increase gross domestic production.so,the suggestion is that government should enforce law to protect workers havin the reasonable working time and enough and fair pay.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T03:50:24.656Z

**Assistant:** Step 1 — Thesis statement

Please paste the single sentence you are using as your thesis (or confirm that this is the sentence you want to revise):

"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Quick feedback on that version
- Clarity and focus: It makes your position clear (you “partly agree”), but it is a bit long and wordy. Tightening will make it stronger.
- Strength: “Partly agree” is fine for a balanced essay, but you should quantify or clarify the balance: who has greater power and why? This helps the reader understand your main argument immediately.
- Preview: You mention two ideas (influencing government; personal green choices) — good. Make the preview clearer and more concise so the reader knows the structure of your essay.
- Language: Avoid phrases like “I also think” and “while less impactful” (these hedge too much). Use confident, precise verbs (e.g., “influence,” “shape,” “drive”) and a clear structure: position + reason(s) + preview.

How to revise it (a short checklist)
- Start with a clear position (e.g., “I partly agree that…” or “I agree to some extent…”).
- Immediately state the main reason or comparative claim (who has greater power: governments/corporations).
- Preview two specific supporting points (e.g., political influence and consumer/behavioural influence).
- Use one concise sentence, confident language, and avoid extra hedging phrases.

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using those tips? Paste your revised thesis and I’ll give focused feedback. Once you’re happy with the new thesis, we’ll move to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T03:50:40.436Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-12-07T03:51:12.205Z

**Assistant:** Great — thank you. Before we move on, I need to confirm the revised thesis (Step 1 is mandatory).

Please paste the single revised thesis sentence you want to use (or confirm that you accept the revised version you imagined). Remember the thesis should:
- Clearly answer the question (state your stance).
- Preview the essay’s main points (e.g., political influence and personal behaviour).
- Use confident, precise language.

Are you happy with that revised thesis? Paste it here so I can give quick feedback and confirm before we go to Step 2.

Step 2 — Topic sentence
Once you paste the revised thesis, tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (paragraph 1 = the paragraph about influencing government; paragraph 2 = the paragraph about personal lifestyle changes). Then paste the current topic sentence from that paragraph.

I’ll give focused feedback on how well that topic sentence connects to the revised thesis and guide you to revise it. Would you like to paste the thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T03:51:22.877Z

**You:** Revise topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-12-07T03:51:49.270Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — ready to continue. Please paste the single revised thesis sentence you want to use (or type “I accept the original thesis” if you decide to keep the one you already wrote). 

Reminder checklist for the thesis:
- Clearly answer the question (state your stance).
- Preview the two main points (political influence and personal behaviour).
- Be one concise, confident sentence (avoid hedging like “I think” or “maybe”).

After you paste and I give quick feedback, confirm you’re happy with it and then tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (paragraph 1 = influence on government; paragraph 2 = personal lifestyle changes) and paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence. Would you like to paste the revised thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T03:51:56.893Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on

*Time:* 2025-12-07T03:52:41.254Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I can move on, but I do need a confirmed thesis before we edit a paragraph (Step 1 is required). You wrote “let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement” — that’s fine if you want me to assume a clear, revised thesis. Please choose one:

- Option A: Paste the single revised thesis sentence you want me to use. (Quickest and best.)
- Option B: Tell me to assume this concise thesis summary: “Governments and large corporations hold greater power to reduce emissions, but individuals can shape policy and contribute through greener personal choices.” (I will use this for the next steps if you don’t want to paste a sentence.)

Once you confirm Option A or B, tell me which body paragraph you want to work on:
- paragraph 1 = influencing government and politicians
- paragraph 2 = personal lifestyle changes

Then paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence. I’ll give focused feedback on how well it connects to the (assumed) thesis and guide you to revise it.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T03:52:50.945Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentence and move on

*Time:* 2025-12-07T03:56:48.292Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I’m ready to continue. Quick reminder: Step 1 (thesis revision) is required before we move on. Please either:

- Paste your revised single-sentence thesis here, OR  
- Confirm that I should use this concise thesis summary for our edits: “Governments and large corporations hold greater power to reduce emissions, but individuals can shape policy and contribute through greener personal choices.” (Type “Use this” to confirm.)

After you confirm the thesis, tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (paragraph 1 = influence on government; paragraph 2 = personal lifestyle changes) and paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence. We’ll revise the topic sentence together, and then you’ll try revising it; once you’re happy, we’ll revise the rest of the paragraph.

Would you like to paste a thesis now or “Use this”?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T03:57:02.926Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the body paragraph and move on

*Time:* 2025-12-07T03:57:29.297Z

**Assistant:** I can’t move on until we complete Step 1 (thesis revision). Please choose one of these two quick options so we can continue:

1) Paste the single revised thesis sentence you want to use (one sentence only). I will give quick feedback and confirm before we go to Step 2.

2) If you prefer not to write one now, type “Use the concise thesis” to confirm that I should assume the short thesis idea we discussed earlier (that governments and large corporations hold greater power to reduce emissions, but individuals can shape policy and contribute through greener personal choices).

Reminder checklist for the thesis (one sentence):
- Clearly answer the question (state your stance).
- Preview the two main points you will discuss (influencing policy; personal behaviour).
- Use confident, precise language (no hedging like “I think”).

Once you paste or type “Use the concise thesis,” tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (paragraph 1 = influence on government; paragraph 2 = personal lifestyle changes) and paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence. I’ll then help you revise it. Would you like to paste the thesis or confirm “Use the concise thesis”?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T03:57:39.393Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the rest of essay and move on bla bla blah

*Time:* 2025-12-07T03:58:32.781Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I can help, but Step 1 (thesis revision) is required before we edit a paragraph. Please do one of these two quick things so we can continue:

1) Paste the single revised thesis sentence you want to use (one sentence only). I’ll give focused feedback and we’ll confirm it.  
OR  
2) Type “Use the concise thesis” to confirm I should assume this short thesis for our edits:  
Governments and large corporations hold greater power to reduce emissions, but individuals can shape policy and contribute through greener personal choices.

Quick reminders for your thesis (use these to check your sentence):
- State your stance clearly (e.g., “I partly agree” or “I agree to some extent”).  
- Preview the two main points you will discuss (influencing policy; personal behaviour).  
- Keep it one concise, confident sentence (avoid hedging like “I think” or long extra clauses).

If you want a simple structure to follow (fill the brackets, don’t copy as a full sentence from me):  
[Stance], because [main reason about government/corporate power]; however, [secondary point previewing how individuals can influence policy and act personally].

Once you paste the thesis (or type “Use the concise thesis”), tell me which body paragraph you want to work on:
- paragraph 1 = influence on government and politicians  
- paragraph 2 = personal lifestyle changes

Then paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence and we’ll move to Step 2. Would you like to paste the revised thesis now or choose “Use the concise thesis”?
