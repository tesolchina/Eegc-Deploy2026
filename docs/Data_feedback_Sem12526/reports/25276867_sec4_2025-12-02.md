            ## Contribution Analysis

            Based on the detailed assessment and chat history you shared, here is a concise summary and guidance to move forward effectively:

---

**Summary of Current Situation:**  
- The student’s original essay is a good starting point with a clear thesis and organized paragraphs but has issues with grammar, vocabulary range, and depth of argument.  
- The revised essay submission contains placeholders instead of real revisions, so no actual improvement can be evaluated.  
- In the AI-assisted revision chat, the student repeatedly declined to paste actual revised text, responding instead with “pretend” or filler phrases.  
- This prevented iterative refinement and meaningful application of feedback.  
- The AI assistant provided clear, scaffolded guidance and concrete examples, but without real input from the student, progress stalled.  

---

**Key Recommendations for the Student:**  
1. **Submit Concrete Revisions:**  
   - Start by rewriting the thesis statement clearly, confidently, and as a single sentence previewing two main points with relative importance.  
   - Paste this revised thesis in full rather than summarizing or pretending.  
2. **Revise Topic Sentences and Body Paragraphs Concretely:**  
   - Choose one paragraph (e.g., Paragraph 1 on government influence).  
   - Rewrite and paste the topic sentence explicitly linking to your revised thesis.  
   - Then rewrite the supporting sentences with clearer cause-effect connections, specific examples, and better grammar.  
3. **Address Grammar and Vocabulary:**  
   - Review the essay for common errors (subject-verb agreement, articles, fragments).  
   - Use richer and more precise vocabulary to strengthen arguments.  
4. **Engage in Iterative Feedback:**  
   - Share your revisions with the AI to get focused feedback and make adjustments step-by-step.  
   - Avoid skipping the submission of actual draft sentences.  
5. **Use Specific Examples and Evidence:**  
   - Incorporate concrete examples of citizen influence on policy (e.g., successful environmental legislation due to public pressure).  
   - Mention data or named campaigns where possible for increased credibility.

---

**Next Steps for the Instructor:**  
- Request the student to provide actual revised sentences rather than placeholders or hypothetical responses.  
- Explain that sharing real revisions enables both AI and instructor to offer constructive, targeted feedback.  
- Encourage the student to break down the revision process into manageable parts: thesis first, then topic sentences, then body paragraphs.  
- Suggest using available writing resources or grammar tools to assist with mechanical accuracy.  

---

If the student follows these concrete steps and actively shares their work in each stage, their writing can improve significantly both in content quality and language accuracy. The AI can then function as an effective revision partner through detailed, iterative support.

---

If you want, I can help draft a message to the student encouraging this more active revision approach or prepare example revisions to guide them specifically. Just let me know!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - Good. The essay presents a clear, relevant position and develops two distinct supporting lines (citizen influence on government; individual lifestyle choices). Examples (voting, protests, consumer pressure) are appropriate though general and limited in depth.
- Organization: 20/25 - Good. The essay has a logical paragraph structure (intro, two body paragraphs, conclusion). Transitions and paragraph cohesion are generally present but some sentences disrupt flow (e.g., repetition and abrupt clauses).
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Satisfactory. Vocabulary is adequate and appropriate for the topic, but word choice is often simple and sometimes imprecise ("maybe just listen a little," "so this is problem").
- Grammar: 17/25 - Satisfactory. There are frequent grammatical and mechanical errors that affect clarity (subject-verb agreement, article use, sentence fragments: "so is not always working well," "so this is problem," "nothing happen").
- **Original Essay Total: 75/100**

Justifying evidence (original): thesis sentence — "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play." Body example — "if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy."

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - Satisfactory. The revised file contains placeholders and no concrete rewritten thesis or paragraph-level improvements. Core ideas from the original remain, but there is no demonstrable development or stronger argumentation.
- Organization: 17/25 - Satisfactory. The structure is intact, but placeholders like "(revised thesis statement here)" and "bla bla bla" break coherence and make it impossible to confirm improved logical progression.
- Vocabulary: 17/25 - Satisfactory. Vocabulary remains simple; placeholders prevent demonstration of richer or more precise word choice.
- Grammar: 16/25 - Needs Improvement. The draft still contains many of the original grammatical problems; placeholders and informal markers ("bla bla bla") further reduce the formal academic tone.
- **Revised Essay Total: 67/100**

Justifying evidence (revised): the revised document contains explicit placeholders — "bla bla bla ... ... (revised thesis statement here)" and phrases like "revised the topic sentences bla bla bla …" which indicate the student did not paste actual revisions.

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -8 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None substantive can be identified in the submitted revised file; the student used "pretend" responses in the chat rather than posting actual revisions.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Revise the thesis into a single, confident sentence that previews the two explicit supporting points and their relative weight.
  - Provide a concrete, revised topic sentence that explicitly links to the confirmed thesis (e.g., "As the primary channel for public influence, citizens pressure policymakers through voting and protest...").
  - Rewrite the first body paragraph's supporting sentences to include concrete mechanisms, evidence, and clearer cause-effect linking; fix grammar and sentence-level clarity.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9**
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided detailed, scaffolded guidance on revising the thesis, topic sentences, and body paragraph. The student repeatedly declined to provide actual revised text and instead used "let's pretend" statements ("let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement," "let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences," "ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1 bla bla bla"). Because the student did not paste revised sentences, the interaction did not progress into concrete iterative editing.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 - Basic. Although there are 9 exchanges and the assistant offered structured, multi-step guidance, the student's replies did not provide substantive content (they repeatedly said "pretend" rather than pasting revisions). The chat contains helpful prompts and directions from the AI but limited real student-driven elaboration or examples.
  - Evidence: assistant prompts requesting the revised thesis and topic sentence; student replies: "let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on bla bla bla ..." and "let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on bla bla bla …"
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 - Limited. The student did not critically evaluate or accept/reject specific AI suggestions with evidence; instead they avoided implementing changes or discussing choices.
  - Evidence: no instances where the student commented on suggestions such as tone adjustments, fragments to use, or indicated acceptance of particular phrasings.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 - Limited. There is no evidence of iterative revision cycles: the assistant repeatedly requested a revised thesis/topic sentence and the student did not provide revised drafts to refine.
  - Evidence: assistant repeatedly: "Please paste your revised thesis now" / "Paste your revised topic sentence" — student did not provide them.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 4/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The original essay shows a clear central claim and appropriate organization into introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion — a useful base for revision.
  - Evidence: original thesis identifies two supporting points; paragraphs align with those points.
- The student interacted with the AI enough to receive step-by-step guidance; the AI provided explicit, actionable scaffolding (thesis fragments, topic-sentence fragments, and process steps).
  - Evidence: assistant’s detailed suggestions: "State your position clearly... preview structure... 'by pressuring policymakers through voting, protest, and public opinion'."

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Provide actual revised text rather than hypothetical statements so the AI and the instructor can assess applied changes. Recommendation: paste the revised thesis and revised paragraph text into the chat for concrete feedback.
- Address grammar and sentence-level errors throughout the essay; focus on subject-verb agreement, article usage, and eliminating fragments.
- Use specific evidence and examples to strengthen arguments (e.g., cite a policy change influenced by public pressure or a statistic showing consumer-driven market shifts).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student provided the original draft but repeatedly declined to provide revised text or clear learning goals; this limited the AI's ability to help produce concrete revisions.
  - Evidence: assistant repeatedly asked for revised thesis/topic sentence; student replied "pretend" rather than pasting revisions.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student followed the AI's suggested process by indicating which paragraph to work on and engaging with the ordered steps in principle.
  - Evidence: student chose to work on "body paragraph #1 (influence on government)" when prompted.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - There is no evidence the student evaluated AI suggestions or made choices based on pros/cons.
  - Evidence: no chat messages rejecting, modifying, or defending AI recommendations.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The student did not produce independent revisions to show application of AI guidance.
  - Evidence: absence of pasted revised thesis or topic sentence despite multiple prompts.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Paste concrete revisions into the chat: Start by rewriting the thesis as a single, confident sentence and paste it. Then revise one topic sentence and one full body paragraph and paste each for iterative feedback.
2. Focused grammar work: Run the draft through a grammar pass (subject-verb agreement, articles, sentence boundaries) or request the AI to list and correct specific grammatical errors found in a pasted paragraph.
3. Evidence and specificity: Strengthen claims with one or two concrete examples or data points (even simple, named examples of policy changes driven by public pressure), and ask the AI to help integrate citations or details.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student did not complete the required revision tasks: they did not submit a revised thesis statement, revised topic sentence, or a revised body paragraph. The chat shows multiple prompts from the assistant requesting these, but the student responded with "let's pretend" rather than providing real text. Please request the student to submit actual revised content for a meaningful assessment and to demonstrate their ability to apply AI feedback.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:

*Time:* 2025-12-02T12:44:16.319Z

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-12-02T12:01:41.352Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-12-02T12:02:54.964Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for sharing your thesis. Let’s work on making it clearer, stronger, and more academic before we move on.

Step 1 — Feedback on your current thesis
Your thesis: "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

What’s working
- You state a clear position (partial agreement).
- You identify two main ideas you treat in the essay: citizen influence on government and individual lifestyle choices.

What to improve
- Tone and confidence: Phrases like “I believe,” “I also think,” and “partly agree” weaken the academic tone. Use direct, confident language.
- Precision and focus: The thesis doesn’t clearly say how important each element is or preview the structure of the essay strongly enough.
- Organization preview: The essay should signal the two main supporting points more explicitly and how they relate to your stance (e.g., which is primary and why).

Concrete suggestions (do not copy as a full sentence — combine these ideas into your own revision)
- Open with a clear stance: e.g., “I agree to an extent” or “I partly agree” but follow immediately with why in precise terms.
- Replace “I believe” with active wording that states the relationship: e.g., “because citizens can pressure policymakers” or “because individual actions influence policy and market demand.”
- Preview the essay structure: briefly mention the two supporting points and their relative importance, for example: (1) political influence (primary mechanism) and (2) collective lifestyle changes that shape markets and norms (supporting role).

Helpful fragments you can use when you rewrite (mix and match into one sentence)
- “Individuals cannot replace government and corporate action”
- “but they are crucial for pressuring policymakers through voting, protest and public opinion”
- “and for shifting consumer demand and social norms through collective lifestyle changes”

Would you like to try revising your thesis now using those suggestions? Paste your new version here, and we’ll improve it together.

*Time:* 2025-12-02T12:03:10.377Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on bla bla bla ...

*Time:* 2025-12-02T12:08:47.545Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s continue, step by step.

First: please paste the revised thesis you decided on (or confirm that you want me to assume the improved thesis we discussed). I need to see it briefly so I can check the connection between thesis and the paragraph you choose.

Second: choose which body paragraph you want to work on:
- Paragraph 1: influence on government/politicians
- Paragraph 2: individual lifestyle changes and market signals

Tell me which paragraph you pick, and paste its current topic sentence (or say you want to use the one already in your draft). I will give focused feedback on how well that topic sentence connects to the (revised) thesis and suggest short phrase-level improvements. Would you like to try that now?

*Time:* 2025-12-02T12:09:10.653Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-12-02T12:26:49.700Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — you’ve given a strong start. Before we move on, we need to complete Step 1 (thesis revision) so the rest of the revision connects clearly.

Step 1 — Please paste your revised thesis now
- If you already rewrote it, paste that one.
- If you prefer, say “assume improved thesis” and I’ll propose feedback based on the earlier suggestions.

Quick reminder of what to aim for in your revision (use these fragments to build one confident sentence; do not include “I think”/“maybe”):
- State your position clearly (e.g., “I partially agree” or “I agree to an extent”).
- Say why briefly (primary mechanism + secondary role).
- Preview structure: mention pressuring policymakers and shifting consumer norms/behaviour.

Helpful fragments you can mix into your own single sentence:
- “Individuals cannot replace government and corporate action”
- “but they are crucial for pressuring policymakers through voting, protest, and public opinion”
- “and for shifting consumer demand and social norms through collective lifestyle changes”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Paste it here and I’ll give focused feedback. 

After we finalize the thesis, pick one body paragraph to revise:
- Paragraph 1: influence on government/politicians
- Paragraph 2: individual lifestyle changes and market signals

Tell me which paragraph you choose and paste its current topic sentence. I’ll check how well it connects to your confirmed thesis and give short, actionable guidance to revise it. Would you like to proceed?

*Time:* 2025-12-02T12:27:01.870Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1 bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-12-02T12:32:26.543Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m ready to work on paragraph 1 with you. A quick reminder: Step 1 (revising the thesis) is mandatory before we revise a paragraph so the topic sentence can match it. Please do one of the following now:

- Paste your revised thesis here, OR
- Type “assume improved thesis” if you want me to proceed using the stronger thesis we discussed earlier (that individuals play a supporting but important role by pressuring policymakers and shifting consumer norms).

You chose paragraph 1 (influence on government). Next, tell me which topic sentence you want to use:
- The current one from your draft: “The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”
or
- Paste a different topic sentence if you already rewrote it.

Quick, focused feedback on that current topic sentence (do not revise it for you yet):
- Strengths: It is clear and directly connects to one of your main points (political influence).
- Cautions: The phrase “the most important” is strong — only keep it if your revised thesis also presents political influence as the primary mechanism. If your thesis presents both roles as important but gives priority to government/corporate action, consider softening or explicitly linking it to the thesis (e.g., indicate that political influence is the primary way individuals have impact).
- Make sure the topic sentence signals the paragraph’s focus on mechanisms (voting, protests, public opinion) so the supporting sentences have a clear target.

I’ll help with short phrase-level suggestions you can mix into your own revision (not full sentences). Possible useful fragments:
- “as the primary channel through which citizens affect policy”
- “by pressuring policymakers through voting, protest, and public opinion”
- “which compels governments to adopt stricter environmental laws and invest in clean energy”

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now using one of those fragments? Paste your revised topic sentence and I’ll give quick feedback. After we finalize it, we’ll move to revising the rest of the paragraph (supporting sentences and clarity).

*Time:* 2025-12-02T12:32:48.080Z
