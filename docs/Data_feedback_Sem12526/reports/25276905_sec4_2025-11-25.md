            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for sharing your chat history and final assessment summary. It shows you engaged well with AI guidance, focusing on revision areas like thesis clarity, topic sentences, and paragraph coherence. You worked stepwise and made concrete improvements but mostly accepted suggestions rather than deeply critiquing or independently rewriting in chat.

Here’s a consolidated plan for enhancing your essay and AI collaboration skills going forward:

1. **Revise independently first, then seek feedback:**  
Try drafting your own thesis, topic sentences, or paragraphs before sharing with AI or tutors. This will strengthen your critical thinking and make feedback more targeted and meaningful.

2. **Deepen critical questioning of AI suggestions:**  
Instead of accepting AI prompts as-is, ask yourself:  
- Does this fully capture my idea?  
- Is this formal and concise enough?  
- Are there alternative ways to express the same idea better?  
Raise these questions in chat to foster a richer dialogue.

3. **Focus on grammar and vocabulary precision:**  
Alongside revision of ideas, spend dedicated time on language accuracy and variety. Use resources like grammar checkers, vocabulary lists, or academic writing guides.

4. **Enhance paragraph transitions and flow:**  
Practice using linking phrases (e.g., “Furthermore,” “In addition,” “Consequently”) to connect ideas smoothly and guide the reader logically through your essay.

5. **Engage in iterative revisions beyond surface fixes:**  
Try multiple drafts where you refine idea clarity, tone, and organization step-by-step, reflecting on previous versions critically before moving forward.

To help you get started on rewriting the paragraph you asked about (automation encouraging workers to upskill and transition to better jobs), here’s a polished example integrating clarity, coherence, and grammar:

---

Automation drives workers to develop new technical skills, enabling them to transition into higher-paying, knowledge-based jobs. AI and automation can perform repetitive tasks that workers formerly did daily, increasing efficiency and reducing labor costs. For instance, robots in factories can produce important, small components more quickly and accurately than humans. As workers acquire new skills over time, they can shift into more complex roles that offer higher salaries and better career opportunities. Ultimately, this workforce transformation contributes positively to global employment prospects in the long term.

If you want, try rewriting your paragraph along these lines in your own words, and I can help refine it further!

Please let me know if you'd like additional targeted exercises or revision strategies based on your assessment and chat history. I’m here to support your progress!

## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship  
## Module: AI for Revising Essays  

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:  
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The essay presents basic relevant ideas on automation's effects on employment but lacks clarity and development; some explanations are unclear or repetitive.  
- Organization: 16/25 - Essay shows some paragraphing but ideas often jump, and transitions are weak, leading to slightly confusing progression.  
- Vocabulary: 16/25 - Vocabulary is fairly limited with some inaccurate word usage and awkward phrasing (e.g., “reduce the enhance,” “product something which is important and small”).  
- Grammar: 14/25 - Frequent grammar errors and awkward sentence structures impede clarity (singular/plural errors, incorrect verb forms).  
- **Original Essay Total: 63/100**  

#### Revised Essay Scores:  
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - Ideas are clearer, more logically presented, and explanations improved. The essay shows a better understanding of automation's dual impact on employment.  
- Organization: 20/25 - Improved paragraph coherence and logic; clearer connection to thesis though some minor flow issues remain.  
- Vocabulary: 19/25 - Vocabulary range expanded modestly with more precise terms (“repetitive tasks,” “labor cost”), but some basic language awkwardness persists.  
- Grammar: 18/25 - Improved accuracy and sentence clarity, but still occasional grammar mistakes and minor awkward phrasing.  
- **Revised Essay Total: 77/100**  

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:  
- **Overall Improvement: +14 points**  
- **Key Improvements Made:**  
  - Thesis statement made more coherent, capturing the complexity that automation displaces some workers but creates opportunities.  
  - Topic sentences were significantly improved to better align with thesis and clarify paragraph focus (e.g., revised topic sentence about automation replacing dangerous jobs).  
  - Body paragraphs contain clearer examples and explanations, with reduced grammar errors improving readability.  
- **Missed Opportunities:**  
  - Some sentences still awkward and could be made more concise and formal to suit academic writing style.  
  - Greater use of linking phrases and transitions would enhance flow and logical progression further.  
  - Vocabulary could be enriched further with more precise and topic-specific terms.  

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:  
- **Total Exchanges: 15** (student initiated multiple requests for revision suggestions, assistant gave detailed guidance)  
- **Conversation Quality:** The conversation shows moderate depth, with the student focusing on stepwise revision (thesis, topic sentences, paragraphs). The student explicitly states goals (e.g., strengthening connection to thesis). The assistant provides scaffolding and encourages student self-revision. However, student mainly asks “how to revise” without showing own rewritten drafts in most exchanges, limiting evidence of deep critical engagement.  

#### Interaction Scores:  
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Adequate exchanges with relevant questions and responses; moderate depth but largely focused on clarification and revision requests rather than multi-level critical questioning or reflection beyond surface fixes.  
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - Student accepts AI guidance with minimal visible critical evaluation or rejection; the chat lacks explicit questioning of suggestions or exploration of alternatives.  
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - Some iterative steps evident (focus on thesis, topic sentences, paragraphs), but little evidence of multiple meaningful revision cycles or substantial rewriting by the student in chat; mostly requests for revision strategies rather than demonstrating iterative refinement.  
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**  

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:  
- Student recognizes need to improve thesis and topic sentences and seeks targeted help, showing strategic focus.  
- Engagement with tutor shows willingness to revise and improve essay clarity.  
- Essay improvements reflect integration of suggested structural and content changes.  

#### Areas for Improvement:  
- Student could benefit from attempting and sharing own revised sentences more actively before seeking feedback to deepen critical engagement.  
- Greater care with grammar and vocabulary precision is needed to raise academic language quality.  
- Enhancing paragraph transitions and essay coherence would strengthen organization further.  

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:  
- **Context Provision**: Good – Student clarifies focus areas (thesis, connections to argument), enabling tailored guidance.  
- **Strategic Planning**: Developing – Student follows structured revision steps but with limited proactive iteration or exploration beyond initial AI prompts.  
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement – Little evidence of questioning or evaluating AI suggestions critically in chat.  
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement – Learner largely requests revision models instead of demonstrating attempts to revise independently.  

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT  
1. Actively draft own revisions after feedback and share these for more targeted refinement and deeper learning.  
2. Invest additional time in grammar and vocabulary practice, possibly with focused exercises or resources on academic style and precision.  
3. Work on building stronger linking and transition skills to improve overall essay coherence and logical flow between ideas and paragraphs.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
In recent years. with the automation developing. Automation is transforming industries. Although the automation increase the efficiency to product, it reduce the enhance that people can work. In my opinion. this technological shift ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.
Automation’s development can promote more people to study so that they can work in technological jobs. The AI, automation can replace human to finish the works that it needs the worker to do same task everyday. For example. In the workshop. the robot can product something which is important and small. It not only increase the efficiency. but also reduce the cost of workers. With time going by，the workers will study more knowledge. then will transfor to the high-knowledge jobs. It can promote the workers has more salary and more chance to work. In the long term, it ultimately enhance global employment prospects.
The automation transforms industries can enhance the workers and the workers’ family happiness. It the replace the human to finish the unsafe works, like clean the glass in the high air. For example, the iron needs high temperature to product. many workers injured due to the work. But these works always are the only labour in their family. If the workers injured, the whole family will lose the source of life. So it can avoid many family to lose salary. In the long term, they do not hate to work. More and more people will willing to work. It ultimately enhance global employment prospects.
All in all, automation transforms industries not only can increase the work’s efficiency, but also can develop the structure of global employment. But the automation can not wholly replace human. Some jobs always need human to finish.

Revised:
In recent years. with the developing of automation, industries are being transformed. Although the automation displaces some workers, it ultimately creates more opportunities by fostering new industries and enhancing productivity.This technological shift ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.
Automation promotes workforce transformation by creating a strong incentive for workers to acquire advanced technical skills, thereby qualifying them for new, high-demand jobs. For example, AI and automation can replace human to finish repetitive tasks
that it needs the worker to do same thing everyday. In the workshop, robot can product something which is important and small. This not only increase the efficiency but also reduce the labor cost . With time going by，workers will study more knowledge and then will transfer to the high-knowledge jobs. This allows workers to earn more salaries and have more career opportunities. In the long term, this shift ultimately enhances global employment prospects.
Automation replaces humans in performing high-risk jobs, safeguarding the livelihood of workers‘ families and contributing significantly to their long-term happiness.It can replace the human to finish the unsafe works, like cleaning the glass in the high altitudes. For example, the iron production requires extremely high temperature, and many workers have been injured due to the work. These works are often the only labour force in their family. If the worker is injured, the whole family will lose its  source of livelihood. Automation can prevent many family form losing their income. In the long term, people will not resent work, and more people will be willing to work, which ultimately enhances global employment prospects.
Overall, automation not only increases operational efficiency but also reshapes the global employment landscape by creating new opportunities in technological fields.However, automation can not wholly replace humans, as some jobs will always need to be finished by people.

**You:** Although the automation increase the efficiency to product, it reduce the enhance that people can work. In my opinion. this technological shift ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term. How to revise this thesis statement?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T06:55:01.594Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement with me! Before we revise it, let’s clarify your learning goals. What would you most like to improve in your essay today? For example, do you want to focus on making your thesis clearer and stronger, improving grammar, organizing your ideas better, or something else?

Once I understand your priorities, I can give you feedback tailored just for you. For now, here’s a brief diagnostic of your thesis:

**Current Thesis Statement:**

“Although the automation increase the efficiency to product, it reduce the enhance that people can work. In my opinion. this technological shift ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.”

**Feedback:**

- The sentence is a bit unclear due to grammar and word choice (e.g., "increase the efficiency to product," “reduce the enhance,”).
- It’s good that you express your opinion clearly at the end.
- The thesis should directly answer the essay question and preview the main points or structure.
- Consider using more confident language and clearer phrasing.
  
Before I offer suggestions, can you tell me in your own words what your main argument is about automation and employment? Also, are you ready to try revising your thesis now, or would you like some more guidance first?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T06:55:15.805Z

**You:** Automation’s development can promote more people to study so that they can work in technological jobs.  How to revise this topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-25T06:58:34.896Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your goals with me! Before we dive into revising your topic sentence, could you briefly tell me what you want readers to understand from that sentence? For example, are you emphasizing how automation encourages workers to gain new skills or how it creates new job opportunities? Knowing this will help us make the sentence clearer and stronger.

Also, just to check: do you want to focus today mainly on improving clarity and grammar for this sentence, or are you also looking to strengthen the connection between this sentence and your thesis argument?

Once I understand this, we can work step-by-step to craft a better topic sentence together. Would you like to try rewriting it first with these ideas in mind? Or would you like me to suggest how to start?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T06:58:38.561Z

**You:** Yes, I am looking to strengthen the connection between this sentence and thesis argument

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:00:27.726Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your focus! Strengthening the connection between your topic sentence and your thesis is a great goal—it helps your essay flow better and makes your argument clearer.

Let’s look at the first body paragraph’s topic sentence as it is currently:

**“Automation’s development can promote more people to study so that they can work in technological jobs.”**

Right now, it mentions automation encouraging people to study and work in new tech jobs, which relates to your broader argument about new opportunities. However, it can be made clearer and more directly connected to your thesis about automation ultimately enhancing global employment prospects.

To help you revise, think about these questions:  
- How does this idea about people studying connect with the idea that automation creates more jobs overall?  
- Could you make that connection explicit in the topic sentence?  
- Can you use confident and precise language here?

Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence now with those tips in mind? If you do, I can then offer feedback or suggestions to fine-tune it!

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:00:47.282Z

**You:** The automation transforms industries can enhance the workers and the workers’ family happiness. How to revise?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:03:49.853Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing that sentence! You want to express that automation can improve not only workers' lives but also their families' well-being, right?

Let's first think about the main idea: automation replaces dangerous jobs, which helps protect workers and their families. So, the topic sentence should clearly say that.

Also, the original sentence (“The automation transforms industries can enhance the workers and the workers’ family happiness”) is a bit unclear and needs smoother grammar.

Before I help you rewrite it, would you like to try giving it another shot now? If you want, try focusing on these points:

- Automation improves working conditions by taking over dangerous tasks.
- This improvement benefits workers and their families.
- Use clear and simple language.

When you're ready, share your revised sentence, and we'll look at it together! If you'd prefer, I can suggest a model sentence to get us started—just let me know!

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:03:53.655Z

**You:** All in all, automation transforms industries not only can increase the work’s efficiency, but also can develop the structure of global employment.How to revise ?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:08:19.839Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for all this great information! You’ve made a solid start with your essay, and it’s clear you have good ideas about how automation affects jobs and workers’ lives.

Before we work on revising your conclusion sentence, can I quickly check your main focus for that part? Are you aiming to:

- Summarize how automation improves both efficiency and employment structure,  
- Emphasize that automation can’t replace humans entirely, or  
- Something else?

Knowing your goal will help me guide you better.

Meanwhile, let’s look at your original sentence:  
*“All in all, automation transforms industries not only can increase the work’s efficiency, but also can develop the structure of global employment. But the automation can not wholly replace human. Some jobs always need human to finish.”*

Here are a few points to consider:  
1. The first sentence is a bit long and grammatically awkward (e.g., “not only can increase…”).  
2. “Develop the structure of global employment” is slightly unclear—do you mean “create new types of jobs” or “change the job market”?  
3. The last two sentences could be combined to make a smoother ending.  
4. “Human” should be plural or replaced with “humans” or “human workers.”

Would you like to try revising this conclusion with these tips in mind? Feel free to keep it simple and clear! For example, you might want to say something like:

*“In conclusion, automation not only increases work efficiency but also changes the global employment landscape. However, it cannot fully replace human workers, as some jobs will always require a human touch.”*

You can try writing your own version, or if you want, I can give you a few sentence starters to help.

What do you think? Would you like to try revising now?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:08:32.398Z

**You:** Automation’s development can promote more people to study so that they can work in technological jobs. The AI, automation can replace human to finish the works that it needs the worker to do same task everyday. For example. In the workshop. the robot can product something which is important and small. It not only increase the efficiency. but also reduce the cost of workers. With time going by，the workers will study more knowledge. then will transfor to the high-knowledge jobs. It can promote the workers has more salary and more chance to work. In the long term, it ultimately enhance global employment prospects. How to revise this paragraph?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:12:50.723Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing that paragraph! It has some good ideas about how automation influences workers by encouraging them to learn new skills and transition to better jobs.

Before we dive into revising the whole paragraph, let’s focus on one step at a time to make it clearer and stronger.

1. **First, let’s make the topic sentence clearer and more connected to your thesis** (since that topic sentence controls the whole paragraph). Could you try rewriting this sentence so it directly shows that automation encourages workers to upskill and leads to better employment opportunities?

2. After that, we’ll work on clarifying and improving the supporting sentences line by line.

Would you like to give rewriting the topic sentence a try now? If so, think about making this idea explicit and confident—something like:

*“Automation drives workers to develop new technical skills, enabling them to move into higher-paying, knowledge-based jobs.”*

But please write it in your own words first! When you’re ready, share your new topic sentence, and then we’ll work on the rest.

How does that sound? Would you like to start with your revised topic sentence now?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:12:55.370Z

**You:** Automation replaces humans in performing high-risk jobs, safeguarding the livelihood of workers‘ families and contributing significantly to their long-term happiness. This is new topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:14:15.400Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing that revised topic sentence! It’s much clearer and strongly connected to your thesis about the positive impact of automation.

Here’s what’s going well:
- The sentence clearly states that automation takes over dangerous tasks.
- It links that to protecting workers and their families.
- The language is confident and precise.

A couple of small suggestions to make it even smoother:
- Instead of “workers‘ families,” you could say “workers’ families” (just checking punctuation).
- “Contributing significantly to their long-term happiness” is good, but you might clarify whose happiness you mean (workers and families).
- Maybe add a little transition phrase to connect this idea clearly to the main argument, such as “Furthermore,” or “In addition,” at the start.

Would you like to try making a quick revision using these ideas? Or would you like me to suggest one example sentence to compare?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:14:22.102Z

**You:** How to revise this paragraph ? Automation’s development can promote more people to study so that they can work in technological jobs. The AI, automation can replace human to finish the works that it needs the worker to do same task everyday. For example. In the workshop. the robot can product something which is important and small.

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:23:23.409Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing that paragraph! I see you want to explain how automation encourages workers to gain new skills and move into better jobs, which supports your argument that automation ultimately improves global employment prospects.  

Let's work on making this paragraph clearer, more logical, and grammatically correct, step by step, focusing especially on:  

1. Clear topic sentence that connects this idea directly to your thesis.  
2. Smooth, clear explanation of how automation replaces repetitive tasks and pushes workers to upskill.  
3. Specific example that supports your point.  
4. Strong concluding sentence that ties back to your main argument.  

Before I give you suggestions, would you like to try rewriting this paragraph yourself first? Maybe start by rewriting the topic sentence as we practiced, then take it sentence by sentence. Feel free to share what you come up with, and I’ll give feedback to help tighten and clarify your writing.  

If you want, I can also guide you with prompts or suggested sentence starters. What would you like to try first?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:23:32.006Z

**You:** In recent years. with the automation developing. Automation is transforming industries. Although the automation displaces some workers, it ultimately creates more opportunities by fostering new industries and enhancing productivity.This technological shift ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term. How to revise

*Time:* 2025-11-25T07:31:16.737Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing your current thesis! Let’s work together to make it clearer, stronger, and more confident.

Here’s what I notice about your thesis so far:

- It tries to say automation both displaces some workers and creates opportunities, which is good to acknowledge both sides.
- The grammar needs fixing (e.g., “Automation increase” should be “Automation increases”).
- The phrasing is a bit choppy, and the connection between ideas could be smoother.
- The last sentence should preview the main points you will discuss.

Before I suggest anything, can you tell me in your own words what your main argument is about automation and employment? That way, I make sure my feedback matches your ideas.

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now with these points in mind? If you want, I can help you by giving sentence starters after you try.
