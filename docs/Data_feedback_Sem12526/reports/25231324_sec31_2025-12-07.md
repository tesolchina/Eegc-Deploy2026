            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for providing your essay drafts and your requests for revision help. Here is a clear, step-by-step plan and guidance to help you improve your essay effectively, focusing first on thesis and topic sentence revision, then on paragraph development.

---

### Step 1: Revise Your Thesis Statement

**Current thesis (from draft):**  
_"It undoubtedly believes that governments should enforce strict laws to safeguard their rights like protect wages and working conditions as delayed wages, underpayment and excessive working hours are common. Also, stricter laws will secure basic living standards and reduce exploitation."_

**Issues to fix:**  
- Remove “It undoubtedly believes” → Academic essays state claims directly, no “I” or unclear subjects.  
- Fix run-on, unclear punctuation and phrasing.  
- Make one concise and confident sentence.  
- Preview 2–3 main points you will discuss (e.g., wage protection, working hours, economic/social benefits).

**Suggested process:**  
Combine these fragments (choose one from each group) into a clear thesis sentence in your own words. Example:

- **A (position):**  
  - “Stronger government regulation is essential to protect migrant workers,”  
  - “The government must enforce stricter labour laws to prevent exploitation of migrant workers,”

- **B (problems):**  
  - “because delayed wages, underpayment and excessive working hours are common,”  
  - “as weak enforcement allows wage theft and unsafe working conditions,”

- **C (benefits):**  
  - “and stricter laws would secure basic living standards and reduce exploitation.”  
  - “which would improve workers’ welfare and strengthen the local economy.”

Try to write one sentence by combining one from A + one from B + one from C, e.g.:  
_"The government must enforce stricter labour laws to prevent exploitation of migrant workers, because delayed wages, underpayment, and excessive working hours are common, and stricter laws would secure basic living standards and reduce exploitation."_

**Please try writing your revised thesis and paste it here. Once you confirm it’s ready, we will move on.**

---

### Step 2: Revise Your Topic Sentence for One Paragraph

**You asked to improve:**  
_"Moreover, it brings more benefits for the local city or countries if the governments implement the laws to protect migrant workers' rights."_

**Issues:**  
- “It” is vague — replace with clear subject (e.g., “Protecting migrant workers”).  
- “Brings more benefits” → be specific (economic growth, social well-being).  
- Connect clearly to the paragraph's focus and thesis.  
- Fix grammar and word order (e.g., “local city or countries” → “local cities and countries”).

**Suggested fragments to build a strong topic sentence:**  
- “Protecting migrant workers’ rights…”  
- “strengthens local economies and enhances social well-being…”  
- “when governments implement and enforce labour laws,”  
- “because fair wages and working conditions increase productivity and stability.”

**Example revised topic sentence:**  
_"Protecting migrant workers’ rights through stronger government enforcement boosts local economic growth and social well-being by ensuring fair wages and working conditions."_

**Try to revise your topic sentence using these suggestions and paste your version here.**

---

### Step 3: Revise the Rest of the Chosen Paragraph

Once you finalize the topic sentence, revise the paragraph by:  
- Ordering sentences logically: state problem → give clear examples → explain consequences → link back to solution/laws.  
- Fixing unclear terms:  
  - “transformation fees” → “recruitment fees”  
  - “life workers” → “migrant workers”  
  - “Eating fees” → “living expenses” or “food costs”  
- Improving grammar and clarity.  
- Using linking sentences to show why stronger laws are needed.

You can paste your revised paragraph here when ready for feedback.

---

### Summary of Your Next Steps

1. **Rewrite your thesis sentence** as one confident, concise sentence previewing your main points. Paste here.  
2. **Choose a paragraph to revise** (recommended: first body paragraph about wage protection or the paragraph about economic benefits).  
3. **Revise the topic sentence** using the guidance above and paste it.  
4. After approval, **revise the rest of the paragraph** and paste it for focused feedback.

---

### Additional Tips

- Avoid first-person (“I believe,” “it undoubtedly believes”).  
- Keep sentences clear, precise, and concise.  
- Proofread carefully for grammar, punctuation, and vocabulary accuracy.  
- Use the AI suggestions but try to decide which fit your voice/style best; practice explaining your choices for deeper learning.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The original (climate change) essay presents a clear, relevant argument and balanced viewpoint. It identifies two main ways individuals matter (influencing government; personal choices) and gives examples (voting, consumer pressure), showing generally well-developed ideas.
- Organization: 20/25 - The structure is clear with an introduction, body paragraphs and a conclusion. Logical progression is mostly effective though some transitions and paragraph unity could be tighter.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary is adequate and appropriate to the topic, but relatively simple and occasionally imprecise (e.g., “this is problem,” “maybe only a few people”).
- Grammar: 18/25 - Generally understandable sentences but with recurring errors (subject-verb agreement, awkward phrasing, punctuation) and limited use of complex structures.
- **Original Essay Total: 77/100**

Evidence (original): thesis — "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play." (clear position but tentative; shows two main points)

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The revised essay (on migrant workers) makes a clear argument that stronger government regulation is needed and lists specific areas (wage protection, working hours, economic benefits). However, ideas are unevenly developed and sometimes vague or repetitive.
- Organization: 17/25 - There is a visible structure (intro, body points, conclusion) but paragraph unity and coherence are inconsistent; some sentences repeat ideas and transitions are weak.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Several imprecise or incorrect word choices reduce clarity (e.g., "transformation fees", "life workers", "It undoubtedly believes") and limit lexical range.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Frequent grammar, punctuation and sentence-structure errors interfere with clarity (run-on sentences, incorrect pronouns, awkward collocation).
- **Revised Essay Total: 63/100**

Evidence (revised): thesis-like sentence contains first-person/awkward phrasing — "It undoubtedly believes that governments should enforce strict laws to safeguard their rights like protect wages and working conditions as delayed wages, underpayment and excessive working hours are common.Also,stricter laws will secure basic living standards and reduce exploitation." Topic sentence attempt — "First and foremost, the basic wage guarantees are very important for migrant workers. Governments should enforce stricter laws." Economy paragraph attempt — "Moreover, protecting migrant workers brings more benefits as economic growth and social well being for the local city or countries if the governments implement the laws to protect migrant workers' rights."

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -14 points**
  - Original Total 77 → Revised Total 63 = -14
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Student produced a clearer argumentative focus in the revised draft (explicit claim that government regulation is needed).
  - The revised draft moves toward more specific subtopics: wage protection, working hours, and economic benefits — indicating an attempt to preview/structure the essay around concrete points.
  - The student iterated multiple drafts and incorporated AI guidance to add specific problem terms (delayed wages, underpayment, excessive working hours).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Thesis not successfully finalized: the student repeatedly attempted thesis revisions but retained first-person/awkward constructions ("I undoubtedly believe" / "It undoubtedly believes") and run-on structure instead of creating a single concise thesis sentence that previews the essay clearly.
  - Topic sentences and paragraph unity need stronger revision: topic sentences are often vague or split into two sentences; they should be single, specific claims that clearly connect to the thesis.
  - Mechanical accuracy and vocabulary: many word-choice errors (e.g., “transformation fees” vs. “recruitment fees”) and frequent grammar mistakes disrupt clarity and could be corrected with focused editing.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges:** 27 messages (student + assistant exchanges across the session)
- **Conversation Quality:** Robust, iterative, and instructional. The assistant provided stepwise guidance (thesis fragments, topic-sentence strategies, paragraph restructuring), and the student repeatedly posted revised drafts and requested targeted help (thesis revision, topic sentence revision, paragraph improvement). The interaction shows active use of the AI for formative practice.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - The chat history shows an extended multi-step tutoring interaction (many back-and-forth messages, explicit stepwise pedagogy). The student participated across multiple revision cycles and asked follow-up questions (e.g., "So what can we do in revise thesis statement", "Teach me to revise the topic sentences").
  - Evidence: multiple assistant messages supplying fragments and revision templates; student pasted multiple drafts and asked to improve specific sentences.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 - Developing. The student accepted and used many of the assistant's suggestions and fragments but gave limited explicit critical evaluation (rarely challenged or rejected suggestions or provided independent justification for alternative choices).
  - Evidence: student repeatedly applied suggested fragments and structural advice but did not post counterarguments or detailed reasoning about why a suggestion should be changed.
- **Refining Process**: 4/5 - Proficient. The student engaged in multiple revision cycles (thesis attempts, topic-sentence attempts, full-paragraph revisions). The process shows clear iteration and steady incorporation of feedback, though the final thesis remained unresolved.
  - Evidence: successive drafts in the chat (numerous revisions to thesis/topic sentences and paragraphs).

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 12/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Active engagement with the AI: the student asked for help, tried suggested fragments, and iteratively revised sentences and paragraphs (evidence: multiple pasted drafts and direct requests such as "Teach me to revise the topic sentences").
- Clear argumentative intent: the revised draft moved from general claims to more focused subtopics (wage protection, working hours, economic benefits).
- Willingness to learn process: student followed the assistant’s 3-step process (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) and produced multiple versions.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Thesis finalization: create one concise, confident thesis sentence that avoids first-person and previews the paragraph structure (recommendation: combine fragments A+B+C as the assistant suggested).
- Precision of language and mechanics: correct word-choice errors (recruitment fees, delayed wages), fix grammar and punctuation, and simplify sentence structure for clarity.
- Critical engagement with AI suggestions: explicitly evaluate and justify accepted/rejected AI suggestions to demonstrate independent editing judgment.
- Unity and coherence: produce strong single-topic topic sentences and ensure each paragraph follows problem → example → consequence → solution/link back to thesis.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided drafts and specific requests (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph), though sometimes the chat included multiple unrelated drafts (topic shift from climate change to migrant workers) that created some confusion.
  - Evidence: uploaded original climate essay and then worked on a migrant-worker draft; assistant repeatedly requested a single finalized thesis.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - Student followed the AI’s recommended stepwise plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph).
  - Evidence: student asked to revise thesis first and then chosen paragraphs.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - Limited explicit critique of suggestions; the student mostly accepted guidance and implemented fragments without documenting reasoning for choices.
  - Evidence: few messages showing acceptance vs. rejection reasoning.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - While the student edited repeatedly, many mechanical and clarity problems remained; more autonomous revision and proofreading are needed.
  - Evidence: repeated occurrences of the same errors after multiple iterations (first-person thesis phrasing, unclear terms).

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Finalize a concise thesis before revising paragraphs: use one clear sentence (no “I”, no hedging) that states the claim and previews two or three main points. Example template: "[Claim], because [problem 1] and [problem 2]; [result/benefit]." (Use the fragments the assistant provided.)
2. Practice topic-sentence formula: Claim + brief preview. Make each topic sentence a single precise sentence that directly links to the thesis and previews the paragraph’s evidence.
3. Improve editing habits: run a targeted proofreading pass after each revision focusing only on (a) word choice (replace unclear phrases like “transformation fees”), (b) grammar/punctuation, and (c) sentence length. Read paragraphs aloud to catch run-ons and awkward phrasing.
4. Strengthen critical engagement when working with AI: when the assistant offers options, write one brief reason for choosing or rejecting each option — this practice builds independent judgment.
5. Keep essay topic consistent across drafts: ensure the revised essay is the same piece as the original to allow meaningful before/after comparisons.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student did not complete the final thesis revision satisfactorily: despite multiple attempts and helpful scaffolding, the thesis still contains first-person/awkward phrasing and run-on structure. This prevents clear alignment between thesis and paragraphs.
- There is a topic mismatch between the original essay (climate change) and the revised essay (migrant workers). Clarify assignment expectations: is the student revising a new essay or the original climate-change essay? The instructor should confirm which essay should be the focus.
- The chat shows productive engagement and willingness to iterate; with guided support on finalizing the thesis and focused editing for mechanics, the student can substantially improve the revised draft.
- Suggest a short follow-up: ask the student to submit (a) one finalized thesis sentence and (b) one revised paragraph (with topic sentence) after applying the proofreading checklist. This focused task will help measure targeted improvement.

--- 

Student training progress report (emphasis on AI collaboration)
- The student actively used the AI as an in-depth writing tutor and followed a clear revision workflow (thesis ⇒ topic sentence ⇒ paragraph). This shows effective use of AI as a coaching tool rather than merely requesting full rewrites.
- Strengths: high engagement, multiple revision cycles, receptivity to structured guidance.
- Next training focus: encourage explicit critical reflection on AI suggestions (student should annotate which suggestions they accept/reject and why), and implement a short editing checklist after each AI-assisted revision to catch repeated mechanical errors.
- Practical micro-tasks for next session:
  1. Submit one single revised thesis sentence (no hedging, one line).
  2. Submit one revised topic sentence (single sentence) for the chosen paragraph.
  3. Submit that paragraph after one self-edit pass using the checklist (vocabulary, grammar, clarity).
These micro-tasks will foster independence while still leveraging AI support.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:

  More and more workers are working in Hong Kong that they come from different countries or regions. It seems good because it is better for the economy development in the city. However, migrant workers face exploitation due to weak regulations, enduring long hours and unfair pay. It undoubtedly believes that governments should enforce strict laws to safeguard their rights like protect wages and working conditions as delayed wages, underpayment and excessive working hours are common. Also, stricter laws will secure basic living standards and reduce exploitation. In this essay, I will analyze in these three aspects such as wage protection, working hours, and the economy respectively.
  First and foremost, the wage protection is very important for migrant workers. Governments should enforce stricter laws. Many workers report delayed wage payments and high recruitment fees. These delays prevent workers from affording basic needs such as rent and food. For example, transformation fees, living fees and Eating fees. Also, most companies give lower pay for life workers from mainland or other countries. It will affect the workers' life. The long hours for working will enhance their health issues. Consequently, stricter enforcement, fines and wage guarantees are needed to protect workers.
  Moreover, protecting migrant workers brings more benefits as economic growth and social well being for the local city or countries if the governments implement laws to protect migrant workers' rights. It will attract more workers to work there due to strong regulation. The GDP will increase too because the stronger regulation ensures the migrants workers' right. They can take the working breaks to achieve the goal of physical and mental health. It may increase the social outcome and foster the economy development due to huge of workers' effort. 
  In conduction, governments should implement the laws like setting the pay standards and the suitable working times. For example, the
migrant workers can receive the same pay of local people. As a result, governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard them 
rights.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:20:25.678Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:23:03.072Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — you already shared your current thesis: 
"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Step 1 — Feedback on your thesis
- What’s good: It answers the question and shows a balanced position (not complete agreement or disagreement). It mentions two reasons (influence on government; personal choices), so it begins to preview the essay.
- What to improve:
  - Confidence and precision: Avoid phrases like "I partly agree," "I believe," and "I also think." These sound tentative. State your position directly and confidently.
  - Clarity and focus: The sentence is a little long and repetitive (two "I" phrases). Make the extent of your agreement clearer — for example, say whether governments/corporations are more powerful but individuals still matter.
  - Preview the main points more clearly and succinctly. Readers should know the two or three main ideas you will discuss (e.g., political influence, consumer pressure/social norms, and personal lifestyle choices).
  - Use stronger verbs and specific language (e.g., "enable," "shape," "pressure," "drive change").

Quick guidance for a stronger thesis (not a full rewritten sentence — use these parts to build your revision):
- Start by stating your overall position (e.g., governments and corporations bear primary responsibility; however, individuals remain important).
- Then list the two main ways individuals matter: (1) influencing policy and political action (voting, protests, advocacy), and (2) shaping markets and social norms through consumption and everyday choices.
- End with a confident tone (avoid “I think” or “maybe”).

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using those parts? If you prefer, I can give a short template/fragments you can combine — would that help? Once you write a revised thesis, tell me when you’re satisfied and we’ll move to Step 2 (choose a body paragraph to revise).

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:23:17.948Z

**You:** Hi.Can you help me to improve my eassy

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:44:44.083Z

**Assistant:** Great — yes, I can help. Let’s start with Step 1: the thesis.

You already have a solid idea (balanced view, two main reasons). Now try a clearer, more confident thesis. Remember: don’t use tentative language (no “I think,” “I partly agree,” etc.), answer the question directly, and preview the main points.

To help, here are short fragments you can combine into a stronger thesis. Don’t copy a whole sentence from me — use these pieces to build your own:

- A — overall position (choose one):
  - “Governments and large corporations bear the primary responsibility for tackling climate change;”
  - “While governments and corporations have the greatest capacity to reduce emissions;”
  - “Although systemic policy and corporate action are crucial;”

- B — first main point (political influence):
  - “individuals can shape policy by voting, protesting, and pressuring leaders;”
  - “citizens can influence laws and political priorities through collective action;”

- C — second main point (market/social influence and personal habits):
  - “and consumers can drive corporate change and shift social norms through their choices and everyday habits.”
  - “and personal consumption and lifestyle changes help shape markets and public attitudes.”

Put A + B + C together in one confident sentence (remove “I” and any hedging). Try to keep it concise and previewing the essay’s structure.

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using those fragments? Paste your revised thesis here. Once you’re happy with it, tell me and we’ll move to Step 2 — choose which body paragraph you want to work on.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:44:55.873Z

**You:** More and more workers are working in
 Hong Kong that they come from different
countries or regions. It seems good because
it is better for the economy development in the
city. However, migrant workers face exploitation
due to weak regulations, enduring long hours and unfair pay. I undoubtedly believe that governments should enforce strict laws to safeguard their rights. 
First and foremost, the basic protection is
very important for migrant workers so the governments should enforce stricter laws. Some of the views show that several companies pay the labours’ income lately. It causes that the migrants workers don't have enough money to pay the basic needs of their life.For example, thetransformation fees, living fees and
Eating fees. Also, most companies give lower pay for life workers from mainland or other countries. It will affect the workers' life. The long hours for working will enhance their health issues.
Moreover, it brings more benefits for the local
city or countries if the governments implement
the laws to protect migrant workers' rights.
It will attract more workers to work there due
to strong regulation. The GDP will increase too
because the stronger regulation ensures the migrants workers' right. They can take the working breaks to achieve the goal of physical and mental health. It may increase the social outcome and foster the economy development due to huge of workers'effort. 
In conduction, governments should implement
the laws like setting the pay standards and
the suitable working times. For example, the
migrant workers can receive the same pay
of local people. I believe that the governments
should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their 
rights.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:46:45.025Z

**Assistant:** Great — thank you for sharing your draft. I’ll guide you through the three-step revision process. We’ll start with the thesis (Step 1). Please remember: I’ll give clear feedback and helpful fragments, but I will not write full replacement sentences for you. I’ll encourage you to try the revisions so you can practice.

Step 1 — Thesis statement
You wrote: “I undoubtedly believe that governments should enforce strict laws to safeguard their rights.”

Feedback (what’s good)
- The main claim is clear: governments should act to protect migrant workers.
- The statement shows a strong opinion, which is good for an argumentative essay.

What to improve
- Make the thesis more precise: say why governments should act and how this will help (preview the main reasons you will discuss).
- Avoid “I undoubtedly believe” — academic essays usually state the position directly (no “I”/personal phrases).
- Add a quick preview of the paragraph topics (e.g., problems caused by weak regulation such as late pay and long hours; benefits of stronger protections for workers and the local economy).

Short fragments you can combine into a stronger thesis (use these pieces to build your own sentence)
- A — overall position (choose one to start):
  - “Stronger government regulation is essential to protect migrant workers in Hong Kong;”
  - “The government must enforce stricter labour laws to prevent exploitation of migrant workers;”
- B — problem/why (choose one or combine):
  - “because weak regulation allows late payments, underpayment and excessive working hours;”
  - “as current lax enforcement leads to wage delays, unfair pay and poor working conditions;”
- C — result/benefit (choose one):
  - “stricter laws would secure basic living standards for workers and strengthen the city’s economy;”
  - “stronger protections would improve migrants’ well-being and support sustainable economic growth.”

Try building a single confident sentence using A + B + C. Keep it concise and avoid “I” or hedging words (e.g., “maybe,” “I think”). Paste your revised thesis here when you’re ready. Tell me when you’re satisfied and we’ll move to Step 2.

Step 2 — Choose a body paragraph and revise its topic sentence
Which paragraph would you like to work on? (Options: the first body paragraph about basic protections / the second about economic benefits / or the conclusion — I recommend starting with the first body paragraph.)

If you choose the first paragraph, here’s feedback on its current topic sentence:
Current: “First and foremost, the basic protection is very important for migrant workers so the governments should enforce stricter laws.”
- What’s good: It signals this paragraph is about protection and government action.
- What to improve:
  - Make it more direct and specific (replace vague “basic protection” with concrete issues: wage protection, fair pay, limits on working hours).
  - Preview the paragraph’s supporting points (e.g., late payment, low pay, long hours).
  - Use a stronger verb structure and remove unnecessary words like “so.”

Helpful fragments to make a clearer topic sentence (combine a few):
- “The government must ensure wage protection and reasonable working hours for migrant workers,”
- “Because delayed wages, low pay and excessive hours are common,”
- “stricter enforcement of labour laws is necessary to prevent exploitation.”

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now using those fragments? Paste your new topic sentence, and we’ll refine it until it strongly connects to your new thesis.

Step 3 — Revising the rest of the chosen paragraph
Once you’ve revised the topic sentence, we will improve the supporting sentences. Before you rewrite, consider these focused guiding questions and suggestions:

Questions to ask about your supporting details
- Do your examples (e.g., late payment, “transformation fees”) clearly support the new topic sentence?
- Are the terms clear? (For example, “transformation fees” is unclear — do you mean “transfer fees,” “recruitment fees,” or “placement fees”?)
- Does each sentence explain why a problem (late pay, low wages, long hours) shows the need for stricter laws?
- Is there a logical order? (state the problem → give evidence/example → explain consequences → link back to the need for laws)

Editing suggestions and small fragments to use when you revise
- Replace vague phrases: “some of the views show” → “reports and studies indicate” (or “many workers report”).
- Clear vocabulary: “labours’ income lately” → “delayed wage payments”; “life workers” → “migrant workers”; “Eating fees” → “living expenses” or “food costs.”
- Explain consequences: “This causes migrants to be unable to afford basic needs such as rent and food, increasing stress and health problems.”
- Link to laws: “These problems demonstrate why the government must enforce penalties for unpaid wages and set minimum standards for working hours.”

Structure suggestion (use as a checklist, not a full rewrite)
- Sentence 1: New topic sentence (clear claim + preview of points).
- Sentences 2–3: Specific problems with clear terms (delayed wages, low pay, long hours) and concise examples.
- Sentence 4: Consequences for workers (financial hardship, health problems).
- Sentence 5: Link back to the topic sentence: explain how stricter laws would solve or reduce these problems (e.g., fines, wage guarantees, maximum work hours).

Would you like to try revising the paragraph now? Paste your revised topic sentence first. After you confirm it, paste the rest of the revised paragraph and I will give focused feedback on clarity, unity, and coherence (I will not provide a full rewrite).

**You:** So what can we do in revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:50:43.379Z

**Assistant:** Great question — let’s focus on exactly what you can do to revise your thesis. You already have the right idea (a balanced view and two clear reasons). Now we want the thesis to be more confident, concise, and preview the essay’s structure.

Quick recap of what to change
- Remove hedging and first‑person phrases (“I partly agree,” “I believe,” “I also think”).
- State your position directly and precisely (how much do you agree?).
- Preview the main points clearly (e.g., political influence; market/social influence and personal habits).
- Use stronger verbs (e.g., shape, pressure, drive, enable).

Small building blocks you can combine (choose one from each group)
- A — overall position (start with one):
  - “Governments and large corporations bear the primary responsibility for reducing emissions;”
  - “While systemic policy and corporate action are essential;”
  - “Although governments and corporations have the greatest capacity to tackle climate change;”

- B — first supporting idea (choose one):
  - “citizens can influence policy through voting, protest and advocacy;”
  - “collective public pressure can force political change;”
  - “individuals can shape political priorities by demanding stronger laws;”

- C — second supporting idea (choose one):
  - “and consumer choices and everyday habits can shift markets and social norms.”
  - “and personal consumption and lifestyle changes signal demand for sustainable products.”
  - “and widespread green behaviours can encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices.”

How to combine them
- Put A + B + C into one clear, confident sentence. Remove “I” and any hedging. Keep it reasonably short (one sentence that previews the essay).

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using those fragments? Paste your revised sentence here. Once you’re happy with the revision, tell me and we’ll move to Step 2 — pick which body paragraph you want to work on. Would you like a short template to follow instead of fragments?

**You:** More and more workers are working in
 Hong Kong that they come from different
countries or regions. It seems good because
it is better for the economy development in the
city. However, migrant workers face exploitation
due to weak regulations, enduring long hours and unfair pay. I undoubtedly believe that governments should enforce strict laws to safeguard their rights. 
First and foremost, the basic protection is
very important for migrant workers so the governments should enforce stricter laws. Some of the views show that several companies pay the labours’ income lately. It causes that the migrants workers don't have enough money to pay the basic needs of their life.For example, thetransformation fees, living fees and
Eating fees. Also, most companies give lower pay for life workers from mainland or other countries. It will affect the workers' life. The long hours for working will enhance their health issues.
Moreover, it brings more benefits for the local
city or countries if the governments implement
the laws to protect migrant workers' rights.
It will attract more workers to work there due
to strong regulation. The GDP will increase too
because the stronger regulation ensures the migrants workers' right. They can take the working breaks to achieve the goal of physical and mental health. It may increase the social outcome and foster the economy development due to huge of workers'effort. 
In conduction, governments should implement
the laws like setting the pay standards and
the suitable working times. For example, the
migrant workers can receive the same pay
of local people. I believe that the governments
should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their 
rights.

**Assistant:** Step 1 — Thesis statement revision

Thanks — you’ve already given a thesis: “I undoubtedly believe that governments should enforce strict laws to safeguard their rights.” That’s a good start: it’s clear and shows a strong position. To make it stronger and more useful for your essay, try these improvements:

What to keep
- Clear stance: good that you state governments must act.
- Focus on migrant workers: that is clear.

What to change
- Remove the personal phrase (“I undoubtedly believe”) — in academic writing state the claim directly.
- Make the scope and reasons explicit: preview 2–3 main points you will develop (for example: wage protection, limits on working hours, and economic/social benefits of regulation).
- Use precise terms: “safeguard their rights” is okay but could be more specific (e.g., “protect wages and working conditions”).
- Make one concise sentence that answers the question and previews the essay structure.

Helpful fragments to combine (use A + B + C — do not copy a full sentence from me; build your own)
- A — overall position (choose one to start):
  - “Stronger government regulation is essential to protect migrant workers,”
  - “The government must enforce stricter labour laws to prevent exploitation of migrant workers,”
- B — specific problems to address (choose one or two):
  - “because delayed wages, underpayment and excessive working hours are common,”
  - “as weak enforcement allows wage theft and unsafe working conditions,”
- C — benefit/result (choose one):
  - “and stricter laws will secure basic living standards and reduce exploitation.”
  - “which would improve workers’ welfare and support the city’s economic development.”

Quick revision task for you
- Please rewrite your thesis now using those fragments (or your own words). Aim for one confident, concise sentence that states the position and previews the main points.
- Paste your new thesis here. Tell me when you feel satisfied with it. I will give a brief check and then we’ll move to Step 2.

Step 2 — pick a body paragraph
- Which paragraph would you like to work on after the thesis? (Options: first body paragraph about protections; second about benefits for the city; or the conclusion. I recommend starting with the first body paragraph.)

A note on the first paragraph’s current topic sentence
- Current: “First and foremost, the basic protection is very important for migrant workers so the governments should enforce stricter laws.”
- Feedback:
  - It signals the paragraph’s purpose but is vague (“basic protection”) and wordy.
  - Make it specific (mention wages, working hours, enforcement) and show how the paragraph will support the claim.
  - Use a stronger structure: claim + brief preview of supporting points.

Fragments to help revise the topic sentence (combine a few)
- “The government must ensure wage protection and reasonable working hours for migrant workers,”
- “Because delayed wages, low pay and excessive hours are widespread,”
- “stricter enforcement of labour laws is necessary to prevent exploitation.”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Once you’re happy, paste it here and tell me which paragraph you want to revise. Then try the topic-sentence revision for that paragraph and I’ll help you refine it before we edit the rest of the paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T18:00:36.076Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I can work with your current draft. I see this thesis in your text:
"I undoubtedly believe that governments should enforce strict laws to safeguard their rights like protect wages and working conditions as delayed wages, underpayment and excessive working hours are common.Also,stricter laws will secure basic living standards and reduce exploitation."

Step 1 — Feedback on this thesis
- What’s good:
  - The position is clear: you want stronger government laws to protect migrant workers.
  - You mention concrete problems (delayed wages, underpayment, long hours), which is helpful for previewing content.

- What to improve:
  - Tone and confidence: remove first-person phrases such as “I undoubtedly believe.” In academic writing, state the claim directly.
  - Clarity and grammar: the sentence is long and has punctuation and word-choice errors (run-on, missing spaces, unclear phrasing).
  - Focus and preview: make one concise sentence that states your position and previews the main reasons you will discuss (for example: wage protection, working hours/enforcement, and benefits for workers/the economy).
  - Precision: replace vague phrases like “safeguard their rights” with specific protections (e.g., wage guarantees, limits on hours, enforcement mechanisms).

Short fragments you can combine to build a stronger thesis (use A + B + C — do not copy a whole sentence from me; please build your own):
- A — overall position (choose one to start)
  - “Stronger government regulation is essential to protect migrant workers,”
  - “The government must enforce stricter labour laws to prevent exploitation of migrant workers,”
- B — specific problems to address (choose one or two)
  - “because delayed wages, underpayment and excessive working hours are common,”
  - “as weak enforcement allows wage theft and unsafe working conditions,”
- C — benefit/result (choose one)
  - “and stricter laws would secure basic living standards and reduce exploitation.”
  - “which would improve workers’ welfare and support the city’s economic stability.”

Try now: rewrite your thesis in one confident, concise sentence by combining one fragment from each group (A+B+C) or using your own words. Paste the revised thesis here. Tell me when you are satisfied with it — I will check briefly and then we’ll move to Step 2.

Step 2 — Choose a body paragraph to work on
Which paragraph would you like to revise after the thesis? (I recommend starting with the first body paragraph about basic protections, but you can choose any.) Once you choose, paste the current topic sentence for that paragraph and I’ll give focused feedback and helpful fragments to strengthen the connection to your new thesis. Would you like to revise the first paragraph now?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T18:00:51.401Z

**You:** Ys

*Time:* 2025-12-06T18:05:30.125Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s start. Quick recap of earlier feedback on your current thesis ("I partly agree…"): it shows a balanced view and previews two reasons, but it’s tentative (uses “I partly agree,” “I believe”) and a bit wordy. Aim for one confident, concise sentence that (1) answers the question clearly, (2) previews the two main ways individuals matter, and (3) avoids first‑person hedging.

Here are short fragments you can combine (choose one from each group) to build your revised thesis. Do not copy a full sentence from me — use these pieces to make your own.

A — overall position (pick one to start)
- “Governments and large corporations bear primary responsibility for reducing emissions;”
- “While systemic policy and corporate action are essential;”
- “Although governments and corporations have the greatest capacity to tackle climate change;”

B — first supporting idea (political influence)
- “citizens can shape policy through voting, protest and advocacy;”
- “collective public pressure can force political action and stronger laws;”
- “individuals can influence political priorities by demanding better regulation;”

C — second supporting idea (market/social influence and habits)
- “and consumer choices and everyday habits can shift markets and social norms.”
- “and widespread green behaviours signal demand for sustainable products, encouraging corporate change.”
- “and personal lifestyle changes help shape markets and public attitudes.”

Task: Combine one fragment from A + one from B + one from C to make one confident thesis sentence in your own words. Paste your revised thesis here. When you’re satisfied with it, tell me and we’ll move to Step 2 — you’ll choose which body paragraph to revise. Would you like a simple template to follow instead of fragments?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T18:05:39.143Z

**You:** First and foremost, the basic protection is
very important for migrant workers so the governments should enforce stricter laws.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T18:06:24.791Z

**Assistant:** Nice — thank you. We’ll follow the three-step revision process. First, we must revise the thesis before moving on. Then we’ll revise the topic sentence you chose and finally the rest of that paragraph.

Step 1 — Thesis statement (mandatory)
- Please paste the exact thesis sentence you want to use in the essay (don’t paste the whole essay — just the thesis).
- Quick, focused feedback you can expect from me: I’ll check that it (1) answers the question directly, (2) previews your main points (how individuals matter), and (3) uses confident, precise language (no “I think/partly agree”).

Helpful reminders (use these fragments to build your revised thesis; combine one from each group):
- A — overall position:
  - “Governments and large corporations bear primary responsibility for reducing emissions;”
  - “While systemic policy and corporate action are essential;”
- B — first supporting idea (political influence):
  - “citizens can influence policy through voting, protest and advocacy;”
  - “collective public pressure can force political action and stronger laws;”
- C — second supporting idea (market/social influence and habits):
  - “and consumer choices and everyday habits can shift markets and social norms.”
  - “and widespread green behaviours signal demand for sustainable products, encouraging corporate change.”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using those fragments (or your own words)? Paste your revised thesis here. I’ll give quick guidance and we’ll not move on until you’re satisfied with it.

Step 2 — Topic sentence (you already pasted one)
You wrote: “First and foremost, the basic protection is very important for migrant workers so the governments should enforce stricter laws.”

Feedback on this topic sentence
- What’s good: It signals this paragraph focuses on protections and government action.
- What to improve:
  - Be specific: replace “basic protection” with concrete protections (wage guarantees, timely payment, limits on hours, enforcement).
  - Fix grammar/wording: “the governments” → “the government” (or “governments” without “the” depending on context); avoid informal connectors like “so” in academic writing.
  - Link clearly to the thesis: show how these protections follow from your thesis claim and preview the paragraph’s supporting points (e.g., delayed wages, recruitment fees, long hours).

Use these short fragments to build a stronger topic sentence (mix and match — do not copy a full sentence from me):
- “The government must ensure wage protection and reasonable working hours for migrant workers,”
- “because delayed wage payments, recruitment fees and excessive hours are widespread,”
- “and stricter enforcement of labour laws is necessary to prevent exploitation.”

Would you like to try revising that topic sentence now? Paste your new version and I’ll give targeted feedback, helping it connect strongly to your thesis.

Step 3 — Revising the rest of that paragraph (after topic sentence is revised)
When your topic sentence is ready, revise the supporting sentences. Before you paste them, consider these focused questions and small editing fragments:

Guiding questions
- Do the supporting details clearly explain the problems (delayed wages, underpayment, long hours, fees) named in the topic sentence?
- Are the specific terms clear? (e.g., “recruitment fees,” “delayed wage payments” — avoid unclear phrases like “transformation fees”.)
- Does each sentence show why the problem requires stronger laws (cause → effect → solution)?

Short fragments and phrases to use in your edits (use them inside your sentences — not as a full replacement paragraph)
- “Many workers report delayed wage payments and high recruitment fees.”
- “These delays prevent workers from affording basic needs such as rent and food.”
- “This evidence shows why stricter enforcement, fines and wage guarantees are necessary.”
- “Stronger penalties and clearer enforcement would reduce exploitation and improve living standards.”

Structure checklist (use when ordering sentences)
- 1) Topic sentence (revised).
- 2) One or two specific problems with clear terms and brief evidence/examples.
- 3) Consequences for workers (financial hardship, health, instability).
- 4) How stricter laws/enforcement would address these problems (brief link back to topic sentence and thesis).

Next step
- First: paste your revised thesis (Step 1). Confirm you’re happy with it.
- Then: paste your revised topic sentence for the first body paragraph (Step 2).
- After we refine that, paste the rest of the revised paragraph and I’ll give focused feedback on clarity, unity, and coherence (I will not write the whole paragraph for you).

**You:** Teach me to revise the topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-12-06T18:07:40.687Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’ll teach you how to revise topic sentences, and we’ll follow the three-step revision process. First, please paste your current thesis statement (one sentence). We have to revise the thesis before changing topic sentences.

Step 1 — Thesis check (quick)
- Paste your current thesis here. I’ll give a short check to make sure it:
  - Directly answers the question,
  - Previews the main points you will develop,
  - Uses confident language (no “I think,” “I partly agree,” etc.).
- If it needs tightening I’ll give fragments you can combine to rewrite it yourself. Tell me when you’re satisfied and we’ll move to Step 2.

Step 2 — How to revise topic sentences (teaching and practice)
What a good topic sentence must do
- State the main claim of the paragraph (not a detail).
- Link clearly to the thesis — show how this paragraph advances the essay’s argument.
- Preview the paragraph’s supporting points (1–2 items).
- Be specific and concise (use concrete nouns and strong verbs).
- Avoid hedging and first-person language.

A simple formula (use to build your sentence)
- Claim + reason/brief preview
  - Claim = what this paragraph will show or argue.
  - Preview = the main evidence or sub-points you will develop.

Common problems to fix (examples from draft)
- Vague noun: “basic protection” → be specific (e.g., “wage protection,” “limits on hours,” “consumer pressure”).
- Wordiness: remove filler (“so the governments should” → “therefore the government must”).
- Grammar/number: “the governments” → “the government” or “governments” correctly.
- Weak connection: make explicit how the paragraph supports the thesis.

Helpful fragments and building blocks (mix and match — do not copy as a full sentence)
- Start/claim fragments:
  - “The government must ensure wage protection and reasonable working hours,”
  - “Collective public pressure can force political action,”
  - “Individual consumer choices send clear market signals,”
- Preview fragments (to add after claim):
  - “because delayed wages, high recruitment fees and excessive hours are common,”
  - “by encouraging regulation through voting and protest,”
  - “and by increasing demand for sustainable products.”

Practice task
- Choose one paragraph to revise (which one? first or second body paragraph?).
- Paste the paragraph’s current topic sentence only.
- Using the formula and fragments above, try writing a new topic sentence now. Paste your attempt and I’ll give short, focused feedback and a couple of tiny edits (I won’t rewrite the whole sentence for you).

Step 3 — Revising the rest of that paragraph (how topic sentence guides changes)
Once your topic sentence is clear:
- Check each supporting sentence against the topic sentence: does it directly support the claim?
- Order: problem → evidence/example → explanation → link back to topic sentence/thesis.
- Clarify vague words (e.g., “transformation fees” → “recruitment fees”).
- Make consequences explicit (why does this matter? who is affected?).
- End the paragraph with a linking sentence that ties the evidence back to the essay’s main argument.

Useful mini-phrases to use inside the paragraph (not full rewrites)
- “Many workers report delayed wage payments and high recruitment fees.”
- “This prevents workers from affording basic needs such as rent and food.”
- “Consequently, stricter enforcement and penalties are needed to protect workers.”
- “Such measures would help secure basic living standards and reduce exploitation.”

Would you like to try now?
1) Paste your current thesis (one sentence) so I can confirm it’s ready.
2) Tell me which body paragraph you want to revise (and paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence).
Try revising the topic sentence yourself with the formula/fragments above, paste it here, and I’ll help refine it.

**You:** More and more workers are working in
 Hong Kong that they come from different
countries or regions. It seems good because
it is better for the economy development in the
city. However, migrant workers face exploitation
due to weak regulations, enduring long hours and unfair pay. It undoubtedly believes that governments should enforce strict laws to safeguard their rights like protect wages and working conditions as delayed wages, underpayment and excessive working hours are common.Also,stricter laws will secure basic living standards and reduce exploitation.In this essay, I will analyze in this three aspects such as wage protection, working hours, and the economy respectively.
First and foremost, the basic protection is
very important for migrant workers so the governments should enforce stricter laws. Some of the views show that several companies pay the labours’ income lately. It causes that the migrants workers don't have enough money to pay the basic needs of their life.For example, thetransformation fees, living fees and
Eating fees. Also, most companies give lower pay for life workers from mainland or other countries. It will affect the workers' life. The long hours for working will enhance their health issues.

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a good place to work from. We’ll follow the three-step process. First we revise the thesis, then one topic sentence, then the rest of that paragraph. I will not rewrite full sentences or paragraphs for you — I’ll give clear feedback and short fragments you can combine.

Step 1 — Thesis statement (mandatory)
Please paste the single sentence you want as your final thesis. I see this draft in your text:
"It undoubtedly believes that governments should enforce strict laws to safeguard their rights like protect wages and working conditions as delayed wages, underpayment and excessive working hours are common.Also,stricter laws will secure basic living standards and reduce exploitation."

Feedback (brief)
- What’s strong: clear position — you want stronger government laws and you note specific problems (delayed wages, underpayment, long hours).
- What to fix: remove first-person/awkward phrasing (“It undoubtedly believes”), fix grammar and punctuation, make one concise sentence, and preview the main points clearly (e.g., wage protection, working hours/enforcement, economic/social benefits).

Fragments you can mix into one confident thesis sentence (pick one from each group A + B + C and combine in your own words)
- A — overall position:
  - “Stronger government regulation is essential to protect migrant workers,”
  - “The government must enforce stricter labour laws to prevent exploitation of migrant workers,”
- B — problems/why:
  - “because delayed wages, underpayment and excessive working hours are common,”
  - “as weak enforcement allows wage theft and unsafe working conditions,”
- C — benefit/result:
  - “and stricter laws would secure basic living standards and reduce exploitation.”
  - “which would improve workers’ welfare and support the city’s economic stability.”

Try now: rewrite your thesis in one clear, confident sentence using those fragments or your own words. Paste the new thesis here. Tell me when you’re satisfied and we’ll move to Step 2.

Step 2 — Choose a body paragraph to work on
Which paragraph would you like to revise? (I recommend the first body paragraph about protections. If you choose that, paste its current topic sentence or confirm the one below.)

Current topic sentence in your draft:
"First and foremost, the basic protection is very important for migrant workers so the governments should enforce stricter laws."

Feedback on this topic sentence (brief)
- What’s good: it signals the paragraph is about protections and government action.
- What to improve: be specific (name the protections: wage guarantees, timely payment, limits on hours, enforcement), fix grammar (“the governments” → “the government” or “governments”), remove filler (“so”), and preview the paragraph’s supporting points.

Short fragments to help you build a stronger topic sentence (mix and match)
- “The government must ensure wage protection and reasonable working hours for migrant workers,”
- “because delayed wage payments, recruitment fees and excessive hours are widespread,”
- “and stricter enforcement of labour laws is necessary to prevent exploitation.”

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now? Paste your revised topic sentence here. I will give quick, targeted feedback to help it connect strongly to your revised thesis. We will not change the rest of the paragraph until you’re happy with this sentence.

Step 3 — Revising the rest of the chosen paragraph (we’ll do this after topic sentence is approved)
When your topic sentence is ready, paste the whole revised paragraph and I’ll help you tighten the supporting sentences. Before you paste, consider these quick checks I’ll use to guide you:
- Do supporting details directly show the problems named in the topic sentence? (e.g., “delayed wage payments,” “recruitment fees,” “excessive hours”)
- Are unclear terms fixed? (e.g., change “thetransformation fees” to “recruitment fees”; “life workers” → “migrant workers”)
- Is there a clear order: problem → specific example/evidence → consequence → link to why laws are needed?
- Do sentence-level issues (grammar, word choice) make meanings clear?

Helpful phrases you can use inside your paragraph (use as pieces, not full replacement)
- “Many workers report delayed wage payments and high recruitment fees.”
- “These delays prevent workers from affording basic needs such as rent and food.”
- “This increases stress and harms physical and mental health.”
- “Consequently, stricter enforcement, fines and wage guarantees are needed.”

Next step from you
1) Paste your revised thesis sentence.
2) Tell me which paragraph you choose (I recommend the first) and paste your revised topic sentence.

I would like to improve this topic sentence

*Time:* 2025-12-06T18:13:45.035Z

**Assistant:** Good — thanks for the topic sentence you want to improve. Before I help rewrite that topic sentence, we need to complete Step 1: confirm your thesis (this is required). Please paste the single thesis sentence you want to use (one line). If you already have a thesis you’re happy with, paste it or type “use current thesis” so I can check it quickly. Once we confirm the thesis, we will revise the topic sentence and then the rest of the paragraph.

A few quick, focused comments on the topic sentence you gave (so you know what to fix after we confirm the thesis):
- Problems to fix:
  - Vague subject: “it” is unclear — replace with a clear subject (e.g., “stricter labour laws,” “protecting migrant workers”).
  - Awkward phrasing and grammar: “brings more benefits for the local city or countries” is wordy and not idiomatic.
  - Lack of specificity: say which benefits (economic growth, reduced public costs, social stability) and how laws produce them.
  - Connection to thesis: the topic sentence should clearly link these benefits to the argument that stronger laws are necessary.

- Useful fragments you can combine (do not copy a full sentence from me; use these pieces to build your own):
  - Start/claim fragments:
    - “Stronger protections for migrant workers…”
    - “Implementing and enforcing labour laws for migrant workers…”
  - Benefit/result fragments:
    - “…benefits local economies by increasing consumer spending and reducing public assistance costs;”
    - “…strengthens the local labour market and supports economic stability;”
    - “…reduces social tensions and improves community well‑being;”
  - Linking/causal fragments:
    - “…because secure wages and fair conditions increase workers’ purchasing power and productivity.”
    - “…as legal protections prevent exploitation and lower long‑term social costs.”

Would you like to:
- Paste your thesis now so we can confirm Step 1, or
- If you prefer, try revising the topic sentence now using the fragments above and paste your attempt (but I’ll still ask you to confirm the thesis right after)?

Which would you like to do?

**You:** Moreover, protecting migrant workers brings more benefits as economic growth and social well being for the local
city or countries if the governments implement
the laws to protect migrant workers' rights.
It will attract more workers to work there due
to strong regulation. The GDP will increase too
because the stronger regulation ensures the migrants workers' right. They can take the working breaks to achieve the goal of physical and mental health. It may increase the social outcome and foster the economy development due to huge of workers'effort. I would like to improve this paragraph.

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a helpful paragraph to work on. Before we change any topic sentence or paragraph content, we must finish Step 1: the thesis revision. Please paste the single thesis sentence you want to use now (one line). If you want to keep the earlier idea, paste that sentence or type “use current thesis” so I can check it quickly.

Quick feedback about the thesis you’ve been using ("I partly agree…")
- Good: it shows a balanced position and previews two ways individuals matter (influence on government; personal choices).
- To improve: remove hedging and first‑person phrases (“I partly agree,” “I believe”), make the position confident and concise, and preview the two main points more clearly.

Short fragments you can combine to build one confident thesis sentence (choose one from each group and put them together in your own words)
- A — overall position:
  - “Governments and large corporations bear primary responsibility for reducing emissions;”
  - “While systemic policy and corporate action are essential;”
- B — political influence:
  - “citizens can shape policy through voting, protest and advocacy;”
  - “collective public pressure can force political action and stronger laws;”
- C — market/social influence and habits:
  - “and consumer choices and everyday habits can shift markets and social norms.”
  - “and widespread green behaviours encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices.”

Task: try rewriting your thesis now using those fragments (or your own words). Paste the revised thesis sentence here. Tell me when you’re satisfied with it — I will give a quick check. Only after you confirm the thesis will we move to Step 2 and revise the paragraph you pasted (which looks like the benefits/economy paragraph). Would you like to try the thesis rewrite now?

**You:** More and more workers are working in
 Hong Kong that they come from different
countries or regions. It seems good because
it is better for the economy development in the
city. However, migrant workers face exploitation
due to weak regulations, enduring long hours and unfair pay. It undoubtedly believes that governments should enforce strict laws to safeguard their rights like protect wages and working conditions as delayed wages, underpayment and excessive working hours are common.Also,stricter laws will secure basic living standards and reduce exploitation.In this essay, I will analyze in this three aspects such as wage protection, working hours, and the economy respectively.
First and foremost, the basic wage guarantees are
very important for migrant workers. Governments should enforce stricter laws. Some of the views show that several companies pay the labours’ income lately. It causes that the migrants workers don't have enough money to pay the basic needs of their life.For example, thetransformation fees, living fees and
Eating fees. Also, most companies give lower pay for life workers from mainland or other countries. It will affect the workers' life. The long hours for working will enhance their health issues.
Moreover, protecting migrant workers brings more benefits as economic growth and social well being for the local city or countries if the governments implement
the laws to protect migrant workers' rights. It will attract more workers to work there due to strong regulation. The GDP will increase too because the stronger regulation ensures the migrants workers' right. They can take the working breaks to achieve the goal of physical and mental health. It may increase the social outcome and foster the economy development due to huge of workers'effort. 
In conduction, governments should implement
the laws like setting the pay standards and
the suitable working times. For example, the
migrant workers can receive the same pay
of local people. I believe that the governments
should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their 
rights. Choose one paragraph to revise

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a good place to work from. We’ll follow the three-step process. First I need you to confirm the thesis (Step 1). Then we’ll pick a paragraph to revise (you can choose, but I recommend the first body paragraph about wage protection). I’ll guide you to revise the topic sentence (Step 2) and then the rest of that paragraph (Step 3).

Step 1 — Thesis statement (mandatory)
Please paste the single sentence you want to use as your final thesis (one line). I see a version in your draft that starts: “It undoubtedly believes that governments should enforce strict laws to safeguard their rights…” — that needs fixing (subject/grammar, remove personal phrasing, make it one clear, confident sentence that previews the main points).

Quick, focused feedback on that draft thesis
- Remove first‑person or odd subjects (“It undoubtedly believes”) — state the claim directly.
- Fix run‑on punctuation and spacing.
- Make the scope and preview clear: say why stricter laws are needed and list the main points you will discuss (wage protection, working hours, benefits to the economy).
- Keep it one concise sentence; use confident verbs (e.g., “must,” “are necessary,” “will secure”).

Fragments you can combine to build your revised thesis (use these pieces to write your own sentence)
- A — overall position:
  - “Stronger government regulation is essential to protect migrant workers,”
  - “The government must enforce stricter labour laws to prevent exploitation of migrant workers,”
- B — problem/why:
  - “because delayed wages, underpayment and excessive working hours are common,”
  - “as weak enforcement allows wage theft and unsafe conditions,”
- C — benefit/result:
  - “and stricter laws would secure basic living standards and reduce exploitation.”
  - “which would improve workers’ welfare and strengthen the local economy.”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using those fragments (or your own words)? Paste your revised thesis sentence here. Tell me when you’re satisfied with it — I will give a quick check and then we’ll move to Step 2.

Step 2 — Choose a body paragraph to work on
Which paragraph do you want to revise? (Please choose one.)
- My recommendation: the first body paragraph (wage protection and basic living standards). This paragraph currently contains useful ideas but needs a clearer topic sentence and cleaner supporting details.

If you choose the first paragraph, paste its current topic sentence (or confirm the one below) and I’ll give targeted feedback:
Current topic sentence you wrote: “First and foremost, the basic wage guarantees are very important for migrant workers. Governments should enforce stricter laws.”

Feedback on that topic sentence
- Make it a single clear claim that links to the thesis (avoid two short sentences).
- Replace vague “basic wage guarantees” with specific terms: “wage protection,” “timely payment,” “recruitment fees,” “reasonable working hours.”
- Preview the paragraph’s support (e.g., delayed payments, recruitment fees, consequences such as inability to pay rent/food).

Short fragments to help you revise the topic sentence (combine a few into one sentence)
- “The government must ensure wage protection and timely payment for migrant workers,”
- “because delayed wages, high recruitment fees and excessive hours are widespread,”
- “and stricter enforcement is necessary to prevent exploitation.”

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now? Paste your new version here and I’ll help you refine it so it strongly connects to the thesis. Once that topic sentence is approved, we’ll move to Step 3 and revise the rest of the paragraph.

Step 3 — Revising the rest of the chosen paragraph (after topic sentence is approved)
When you’re ready to revise the supporting sentences, paste the whole paragraph (with your revised topic sentence). Before you paste, keep these checks in mind:
- Do supporting details directly illustrate the problems named in the topic sentence (delayed wage payments, recruitment fees, long hours)?
- Are terms clear? (change “thetransformation fees” → “recruitment fees”; “life workers” → “migrant workers”.)
- Is the order logical: problem → example/evidence → consequence → link to why stricter laws are needed?
- End the paragraph with a linking sentence that ties the evidence back to the thesis (how law enforcement would help).

Mini‑phrases you can use inside your sentences (use these as pieces, not full replacements)
- “Many workers report delayed wage payments and high recruitment fees.”
- “These delays prevent workers from affording basic needs such as rent and food.”
- “Consequently, stricter enforcement, fines and wage guarantees are needed to protect workers.”

Next step from you
1) Paste your revised thesis sentence here (one line). Confirm when you’re satisfied.
2) Tell me which paragraph you choose (I recommend the first). Paste the current topic sentence or your attempt at a revised topic sentence.
