            ## Contribution Analysis

            I see you would like to move on to Step 2. Before proceeding, please confirm if you are satisfied with your revised thesis statement or if you want to make any final adjustments.

If you’re happy with your thesis, please say:  
**“Yes, I’m happy with my revised thesis!”**

Once you confirm, we can move on to selecting and revising a topic sentence for either the paragraph about government influence or the paragraph about personal lifestyle choices.

Which paragraph would you like to work on for your topic sentence revision?

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

**You:** Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do.

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s begin with Step 1 of our revision process: **the thesis statement**.

**Please copy and paste your current thesis statement below.**  
(Tip: It’s usually the last sentence of your introduction.)

Once you share it, I’ll give you feedback on how to make it clearer, stronger, and more focused.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:48:23.570Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:49:44.605Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing your thesis statement! Here it is again for easy reference:

"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Here’s my feedback for you:

Clarity: Your main point is clear—you partly agree that individual actions matter less, but you also feel citizens can influence governments and that personal choices are still relevant.
Strength: The phrasing is a bit wordy and uses some “soft” language (“I partly agree,” “I also think,” etc.). Try making it more direct and confident.
Focus: You mention two main ideas—1) citizens can influence governments, and 2) personal lifestyle choices still matter. That’s good! To make this even stronger, briefly mention these two points as your main arguments.
Preview: Aim for a statement that previews the body paragraph structure (influence on government, then personal habits).
Language: Avoid “I think/I believe/I partly agree…” and try to make a direct claim. Use confident language.
Here are a few guiding questions to help you revise:

- Can you make your position clear without “I think/I believe/I partly agree”?
- Can you explicitly mention your two main reasons/points?
- Can you make it one clear, direct sentence?

Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now? I’m happy to look at your new version and give you more tips!

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:49:51.226Z

**You:** I agree that citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I think  personal green lifestyle choices are less impactful, they still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:55:40.026Z

**Assistant:** Great job giving it a try! Let’s take a closer look:

**Feedback:**
- The thesis is clearer, and you identified your two points (influence on government, role of personal choices). 
- There’s still an “I think” that we can remove for a stronger, more academic tone.
- The sentence could be a bit more concise. Try to directly preview the order of your arguments (government influence first, then individual lifestyle).
- Also, see if you can combine your ideas into a single fluent sentence.

**Here are a few guiding prompts:**
- How can you make your opinion sound more direct and academic (for example, “Citizens play a vital role...”)?
- Can you clarify that individual lifestyle choices play a smaller, but still important, role?
- Aim to mention both arguments in a balanced way.

**Would you like to try revising it one more time based on this feedback?**  
(Remember, leave out “I think” and make it one confident, clear claim!)

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:55:46.563Z

**You:** Can I move to step 2?

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:57:28.573Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for your hard work on revising! Before we move on to Step 2, let’s make sure you’re completely satisfied with your thesis statement.

**Please review your latest thesis version** (after my previous feedback) and let me know:

- Do you feel it is now clear, direct, and academic?
- Does it clearly present your two main arguments (1. Influence on government, 2. Individual lifestyle choices)?
- Are you happy with how it sounds, or would you like to try making another small change before we go on?

**If you’re happy, just say “Yes, I’m happy with my revised thesis!”**  
Or, if you’d like one more round of improvement, let me know and we can keep working on it.

Once you confirm you’re satisfied, we’ll move on to Step 2—updating a topic sentence in one of your body paragraphs. Which would you like to choose: the paragraph about government influence, or the one about personal lifestyle choices?
