  Language:
  Goals: Get higher marks with correct grammar
  Challenges: Lack of time during the test

  Rubric: After completing your point-of-view essay, you will use an AI tool to analyse and refine
your writing at various levels, e.g. paragraph structure, sentence construction, and
vocabulary naturalness. The goal of your collaboration with the AI tool is to identify
potential weaknesses and improve your essay.
You may follow these steps when conducting your AI-assisted Review:
1. AI Analysis:
● Input your essay into an AI tool and request feedback on aspects including but
not limited to: paragraph structure (e.g. coherence, flow), sentence
construction (e.g. grammar, variety), and vocabulary naturalness (e.g.
appropriateness, precision).
● Engage in an in-depth “conversation” with the AI tool with multiple meaningful
and relevant exchanges, asking follow-up questions to clarify suggestions.
2. Critical Review:
● Evaluate each recommendation critically, deciding which to implement based
on your understanding and the essay’s intent. Do not blindly accept all AI
suggestions.
● Treat this as an iterative process, not a one-off edit. Revise your essay multiple
times based on AI feedback and your critical analysis.
3. Revised Submission:
● Submit both the original and the revised versions of your essay to Turnitin.
● Save the full chat history to submit with your work as an appendix

            ## Contribution Analysis

            Here is a summary of the final assessment and tailored recommendations based on your revision journey and the work completed:

---

### Summary of Your Progress

- **Thesis Statement:**  
  You replaced the original unclear, informal thesis with a formal, precise, and previewing thesis:  
  *“Governments should enact and enforce stricter labor laws to protect migrant workers’ rights, since inadequate regulation contributes to excessive working hours, unjust pay, and increased exploitation.”*  
  This now clearly states your argument and previews your essay’s structure.

- **Pay Paragraph:**  
  Topic sentence and supporting sentences were revised for clarity, formality, and grammar. The Hong Kong wage figures were kept and presented clearly:  
  *“For instance, in Hong Kong, local domestic helpers may earn around $100–$150 per hour, whereas migrant workers often earn only $16–$20 per hour.”*  
  Informal phrasing was replaced, and subject-verb errors were fixed, strengthening the paragraph’s impact.

- **Hours Paragraph:**  
  You chose a formal, effective topic sentence linking back to regulation:  
  *“One major problem is that migrant workers often face shifts of ten hours or more because weak enforcement lets employers demand excessive work.”*  
  Supporting sentences were polished for grammar, style, and coherence, addressing fatigue and accident risk clearly.

- **Remaining Paragraphs (Exploitation & Conclusion):**  
  These still have grammar, capitalization, and phrasing errors. Starting points and transitions can be stronger and more formal.

- **Overall:**  
  Your essay now has clear academic tone improvements, enhanced structure, stronger evidence presentation with data retained, and better grammar/sentence clarity in the targeted sections.

---

### Key Strengths Demonstrated

- Clear focus on migrant workers’ issues with relevant examples.  
- Effective use of AI collaboration—revising stepwise with clear goals and selective acceptance.  
- Improved academic tone and formal phrasing, particularly in thesis and pay paragraph.  
- Attention to grammar and punctuation in revised paragraphs.

---

### Recommendations for Final Polishing

1. **Finish Polishing Remaining Paragraphs:**  
   Apply the same grammar and formal tone fixes used in the pay and hours paragraphs to the exploitation and conclusion paragraphs. Specifically:  
   - Fix capitalization at sentence starts.  
   - Correct verb forms (e.g., “help locals to did” → “help locals by doing” or “performing”).  
   - Replace informal words and fix spelling (“benifits” → “benefits”, “racist” (noun) → “racism”).  
   - Remove conversational openings (“let me tell”, “to end with”) and replace with formal transitions (“To conclude”, “Finally”).

2. **Cite or Qualify Data Sources:**  
   Add source information or qualifying language when presenting Hong Kong figures to strengthen credibility, e.g., “according to reports,” “recent studies show,” or “as reported by news sources.”

3. **Enhance Conclusion:**  
   Make the conclusion synthesize key points and propose specific policy suggestions (e.g., minimum wage laws, labor inspections, language support services) rather than general statements. This will show deeper engagement and policy literacy.

4. **Final Grammar and Proofreading Checklist:**  
   Before finishing, scan your essay with these quick steps:  
   - Capitalize all sentence beginnings.  
   - Check subject-verb agreement and verb tense consistency.  
   - Fix article and plural errors (“a longer working hours” → “longer working hours”).  
   - Correct common spelling mistakes (tiredness, benefits, racism).  
   - Remove informal expressions and phrases.  
   - Ensure punctuation is consistent with spacing after commas and periods.

---

### Suggested Next Steps for You

- Apply the above targeted edits to the exploitation and conclusion paragraphs. You can paste those parts here for coaching or direct corrections if you want.  
- Add a brief source phrase or citation to your wage example sentence.  
- Rewrite the conclusion to summarize and recommend precise actions for governments.  
- Re-read your entire essay aloud for flow and clarity, using the proofreading checklist.

---

### Final Note

You have made strong formative improvements by focusing on thesis clarity, paragraph coherence, grammar, and evidence presentation. With just a few more polishing steps, your essay will be much clearer, more professional, and persuasive.

Feel free to ask for help revising the final paragraphs or crafting a strong conclusion! Keep up the great work.

            ## 🟤 Grading Result *(Hidden from Students)*

            All three tasks completed: the student revised the thesis statement, revised a topic sentence (pay paragraph; also revised hours topic sentence), and revised a body paragraph (the pay paragraph). 

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The original draft identified relevant problems (long hours, unfair pay, weak regulation) and used a concrete example (Hong Kong domestic helpers), but development was uneven and claims were sometimes vague or unsupported.
- Organization: 17/25 - There was a basic paragraph structure (introduction, three body topics, conclusion) but topic sentences and transitions were weak or informal, which reduced clarity of logical progression.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Vocabulary was generally adequate but repetitive and often imprecise (e.g., “nasty” works, “get less salaries”) with several word-choice issues.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 14/25 - Frequent grammar, punctuation, capitalization, and spelling errors (e.g., “tirness,” “benifits,” sentence fragments) impeded readability.
- **Original Essay Total: 64/100**

Evidence: thesis originally read, “I do think governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights under this harsh phenomenon.” Body example: “Use Hong Kong’s domestic helper as an example, a local helper can get around $100–$150 per an hour, while a migrant worker can only get around $16–$20 per an hour.” Grammar issues appear throughout (e.g., “Long worker hours may increase the rate of accident due to the tirness of workers.”).

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - Ideas are clearer and better focused. The revised thesis explicitly previews the three main problems and the pay paragraph includes clearer data presentation. Still could be strengthened with a stronger conclusion and more evidence or citation.
- Organization: 20/25 - Topic sentences were improved (pay paragraph topic sentence and hours topic sentence); paragraph-level cohesion improved in revised sections. Some paragraphs (exploitation, conclusion) still need clearer openings and transitions.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - More formal and precise language in revised sections (e.g., “Governments should enact and enforce stricter labor laws,” “This disparity is unjust”); some informal phrasing remains elsewhere.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 20/25 - Major grammar, punctuation, and sentence-level errors were corrected in the thesis, pay paragraph, and hours paragraph. Unrevised paragraphs still contain errors (spelling, capitalization, awkward syntax), so full-document accuracy is not yet achieved.
- **Revised Essay Total: 81/100**

Evidence: revised thesis—“Governments should enact and enforce stricter labor laws to protect migrant workers’ rights, since inadequate regulation contributes to excessive working hours, unjust pay, and increased exploitation.” Pay paragraph: “For instance, in Hong Kong, local domestic helpers may earn around $100–$150 per hour, whereas migrant workers often earn only $16–$20 per hour. This disparity is unjust.”

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +17 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis clarity and academic tone: replaced the weak, awkward original with a formal, previewing thesis.
  - Pay paragraph: rewrote topic sentence, clarified the Hong Kong data example, and produced a clear contrast sentence (“Migrant workers put in the same effort … yet they receive much lower pay.”).
  - Hours paragraph: introduced a stronger topic sentence and combined/supporting sentences that explain causes and effects (fatigue, accident risk).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Exploitation/regulations paragraph still contains grammatical errors and informal phrasing (e.g., “Migrant workers exploitation due to weak regulations in additionally.”).
  - Conclusion is still informal and contains grammar/spelling errors (e.g., “help locals to did,” “benifits,” “joyful”), and it would benefit from a stronger specific recommendation and synthesis.
  - Evidence & sourcing: the Hong Kong figures are now presented clearly but lack citation or source attribution; adding source indication or qualifying language would strengthen credibility.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 51**
- **Conversation Quality:** Highly active, iterative, and goal-oriented. Student and assistant followed a clear revision protocol (thesis → one paragraph topic sentence → paragraph revision), the student set priorities (A + C), requested formal tone and to keep data, and repeatedly revised text with assistant feedback. The chat shows multiple revision cycles and targeted grammar/wording fixes.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - The chat contains extensive, multi-step exchanges (51 messages), clear planning, multiple revision cycles, and sustained, task-focused interaction. Evidence: the assistant laid out a three-step plan, the student repeatedly confirmed goals, and the pair iterated on thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph-level edits.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - The student evaluated and accepted many AI suggestions but also made independent choices (e.g., kept the Hong Kong figures, revised a suggested topic sentence, corrected phrasing errors). There was some critical engagement (asking for formal tone, choosing models). Example: the student corrected “migrant employers” to intended meaning and replaced informal phrasing with more formal alternatives suggested by the assistant.
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - Clear iterative process with multiple meaningful revision cycles: thesis revision, topic sentence drafts, sentence-level rewrites, and a focused grammar pass for the revised paragraphs. Evidence: several turns where the assistant suggested versions and the student accepted or adapted them (e.g., model thesis accepted, pay supporting sentences revised stepwise).
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear focus on an important social issue with relevant examples (Hong Kong domestic helpers).
- Strong willingness to iterate: the student followed a structured revision plan and accepted guidance to improve thesis and paragraph-level clarity.
- Effective collaboration: student communicated goals (improve grammar, keep data), made decisions (accept model thesis, keep numbers), and produced corrected sentences (e.g., “Migrant workers put in the same effort…”).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Finish polishing remaining paragraphs: the exploitation paragraph and the conclusion still require grammar fixes and more formal phrasing.
- Evidence & sourcing: include source citation or a qualifying phrase when presenting precise figures to strengthen credibility (“according to X” or “reported figures”).
- Cohesion and synthesis: the conclusion should summarize the argument and offer concise, specific recommendations (e.g., types of laws or enforcement mechanisms) rather than general statements.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - Student stated clear goals (improve grammar, clarity, keep figures) and confirmed choices during the session.
- **Strategic Planning**: Excellent - Student and assistant followed an explicit stepwise plan and stuck to targets (A+C).
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good - The student accepted many suggestions but also questioned and revised them (e.g., rewording topic sentences, asking for formal tone).
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The student actively drafted and revised sentences (several times) rather than passively accepting all AI edits.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Finalize a full-document grammar pass: apply the assistant’s checklist line-by-line to the exploitation paragraph and conclusion (capitalization, articles, verb forms, spelling).
2. Add one or two sourced facts or cite the origin of the Hong Kong figures (even a short phrase like “according to news reports”); this will strengthen the essay’s persuasive force.
3. Strengthen the conclusion: synthesize the main points and propose specific policy measures (e.g., minimum wage enforcement, inspection regimes, language-access services) to show deeper engagement and policy literacy.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student demonstrated excellent use of the AI tool: set clear goals, iterated on revisions, and learned from modeling. Most substantive improvements were made in the revised sections; the remaining issues are concentrated in the unrevised paragraphs (exploitation and conclusion).
- Suggested next step for classwork: require the student to finish the full-document pass (apply exact edits provided in chat) and to add one cited source or a brief note on the data’s origin to support claims.
- Overall, strong formative progress on thesis construction, topic-sentence control, and paragraph-level clarity.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Recently, migrant workers face a host of difficulties in their daily life, ranging from weak regulations, enduring hours and unfair pay. I do think governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights under this harsh phenomenon.

let me tell about enduring hours first. Migrant workers usually work for over 10 hours a day. In their working hours, they are not allowed to have enough rest. Workers that work in factories are even worse, they may need to fulfill the “goal” set by the factory. As a result, they are required to have a longer working hours. But, is it fair? It is unfair to migrant workers. Long worker hours may increase the rate of accident due to the tirness of workers. Workers are not able to keep concentrating under a long time. 

Let’s move on to the unfair pay problem.Migrant workers usually get less salaries compare to other local workers even the job duties are the same. Use Hong Kong’s domestic helper as an example, a local helper can get around $100–$150 per an hour, while a migrant worker can only get around $16–$20 per an hour. it is totally unfair to the migrant workers. They also pay same effort to finish the same tasks, but their salaries are totally different.

Migrant workers exploitation due to weak regulations in additionally. They are not familiar with the language of their working city, and also the culture of their working city. They may also face discrimination and racist in their working environment.

To end with, I agree that governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights. Migrant workers help locals to did some kind of “nasty” works but they cannot get a fair benifits. By enforcing stricter laws, it can create a fairer working conditions and reduce barriers between local workers and migrant workers. The outcomes can positively to make the city become more sustainable and joyful.

Revised:
Recently, migrant workers face a host of difficulties in their daily life, ranging from weak regulations, enduring hours and unfair pay. Governments should enact and enforce stricter labor laws to protect migrant workers’ rights, since inadequate regulation contributes to excessive working hours, unjust pay, and increased exploitation.

One major problem is that migrant workers often face shifts of ten hours or more because weak enforcement lets employers demand excessive work. Many migrant workers routinely work more than ten hours a day without adequate breaks, particularly in factories where employers demand high production targets. They often do not get adequate rest during their shifts, and factory workers may be required to meet these targets, which forces them to work even longer hours. This practice is clearly unfair to migrant workers and increases the risk of workplace accidents because of worker fatigue; workers cannot maintain concentration for long periods.

Another major problem is that migrant workers often receive lower wages than local workers. For instance, in Hong Kong, local domestic helpers may earn around $100–$150 per hour, whereas migrant workers often earn only $16–$20 per hour. This disparity is unjust. Migrant workers put in the same effort and perform the same tasks as local workers, yet they receive much lower pay.

Migrant workers exploitation due to weak regulations in additionally. They are not familiar with the language of their working city, and also the culture of their working city. They may also face discrimination and racist in their working environment.

To end with, I agree that governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights. Migrant workers help locals to did some kind of “nasty” works but they cannot get a fair benefits. By enforcing stricter laws, it can create a fairer working conditions and reduce barriers between local workers and migrant workers. The outcomes can positively to make the city become more sustainable and joyful.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:22:35.127Z

**You:** Revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:36:49.722Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — before I revise anything, let’s confirm a short plan so we work on what will help you most.

1) Quick check of your goals
- What do you most want to improve in this session: clarity/strength of the thesis, grammar (accuracy), paragraph structure, or something else? (Your background said you want higher marks with correct grammar and you have limited time in tests — is that still right?)

2) Brief diagnostic (Rubric-style)
- Thesis & Argument: You state a position (governments should act) but the thesis sentence is unclear and weakly worded. It doesn’t preview the main points.
- Organization: You have a logical set of body paragraphs (hours, pay, regulation/exploitation) but some transitions and paragraph openings are informal or ungrammatical.
- Evidence & Development: You use an example (Hong Kong domestic helpers) which is good, but numbers and comparisons need clearer phrasing and a source-like language.
- Language Use: Many grammar and mechanics problems: verb forms (face → face/are facing), articles, plurals, punctuation, capitalization, spelling (tirness, benifits), and awkward phrasing.

Strengths: clear focus on migrant workers’ problems and useful concrete examples. Good idea structure to work with.

3) Which targets do you want to focus on now?
- From the diagnosis above, tell me which one or two to focus on in this session. You asked to “Revise thesis statement” — do you want to focus only on the thesis right now, or also on grammar/wording in the introduction paragraph?

If you confirm that we are focusing on the thesis now, we’ll move to Step 1.

Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision
- Please confirm that the sentence below is the thesis you want to revise (from your draft): “I do think governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights under this harsh phenomenon.”

Feedback on that thesis:
- It’s unclear and grammatically awkward (“I do think governments enforce…” suggests present actions rather than what you want; “under this harsh phenomenon” is vague).
- It does not clearly preview the main points you discuss (long hours, low pay, weak regulations/exploitation).
- Use confident, precise language and a preview of the main points.

Try this revised thesis (you can accept it, tweak it, or try your own first):
- Suggested thesis: I strongly believe governments must enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because weak regulations lead to excessive working hours, unfair pay, and increased exploitation.

Why this works:
- Answers the prompt clearly (extent of agreement = strong agreement).
- Previews the three main problems you discuss (hours, pay, exploitation).
- Uses confident, direct language.

Would you like to try changing this sentence yourself first, or do you want me to insert the suggested thesis into your essay now?

If you want me to insert it, here is your full essay with only the thesis sentence replaced (I’ve left the rest of the text unchanged so we focus on the thesis first):

Next steps
- Do you accept the suggested thesis, or would you like to revise it yourself?
- If you accept it, confirm that you want to move on to Step 2 (pick one body paragraph to revise its topic sentence next). Which paragraph would you like to work on: the first (hours), the second (pay), or the third (regulations/exploitation)?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:37:15.282Z

**You:** I want to improve my grammar and make it more clear with data support

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:39:43.158Z

**Assistant:** Great — that goal is clear and helpful. Here’s a short plan so we focus on what will help you most.

1) Confirmed goals
- You said: improve grammar and make the essay clearer, and add/data-support where possible. Correct?

2) Suggested specific targets for this session (pick 1–2)
- A: Thesis clarity and grammar (make the thesis sentence precise, grammatical, and preview the main points).
- B: Grammar and accuracy in the introduction and/or conclusion (articles, verb forms, capitalization, spelling).
- C: Evidence clarity and data support in the pay paragraph (cleanly present the Hong Kong example and numbers).
Which of these do you want us to focus on now? (Pick one or two. We must finish the target selection before Step 1.)

3) Brief diagnostic (short rubric-style, focused on your chosen goals)
- Thesis & Argument: Thesis is weak and ungrammatical (“I do think governments enforce…”). It needs clear, confident wording and a preview of main points.
- Organization: Paragraph order is fine, but openings are informal or start with lowercase; transitions could be smoother.
- Evidence & Development (data): You have a useful concrete example (Hong Kong domestic helpers) but the numbers and comparison are written awkwardly and need clearer phrasing and proper punctuation.
- Language Use (grammar): Frequent problems with verb forms (face → are facing), articles (a/an/the), plurals, word choice (tirness → tiredness), capitalization, punctuation, and sentence fragments.

4) Quick question about data
- Do you want me to keep the Hong Kong hourly pay numbers you used ($100–$150 vs $16–$20)? Or would you prefer we remove specific numbers and use a clearer comparative phrase (e.g., “much higher wages for local workers”) because you don’t have a source? If you want numbers kept, I’ll clean the phrasing and show how to present them clearly.

5) Next step (you choose)
- If you want to focus on the thesis first (recommended): confirm which target(s) from #2 to focus on (e.g., A + C or A + B). Then tell me: do you want to try revising the thesis yourself now, or should I suggest a revised thesis for you to accept or tweak? I can also insert a revised thesis into your full essay so you can see it in context.

Tell me your choice for targets (A, B, C) and whether I should suggest a thesis now or you want to try one. Then we’ll move to Step 1.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:39:57.926Z

**You:** A+C

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:41:42.558Z

**Assistant:** Great — A + C is a clear, useful focus: thesis clarity/grammar plus clearer presentation of the Hong Kong pay example. Quick confirmation before we revise:

1) Confirmed targets
- A: Make the thesis clearer, grammatical, and preview the three main points (hours, pay, exploitation).
- C: Make the pay paragraph’s data/evidence clearer and grammatically correct (decide whether to keep the numbers).

2) Quick focused diagnosis (2 sentences)
- Thesis: The current sentence is unclear and ungrammatical and doesn’t preview your points. It needs confident wording like “I strongly believe…” and a short list of the problems you will discuss.
- Pay paragraph: The Hong Kong example is a good concrete detail, but the numbers and comparison are written awkwardly and need clearer phrasing and punctuation (and we should decide whether to keep the exact figures).

Before I give a suggested thesis, one quick question about the data:
- Do you want me to keep the specific hourly numbers you used for Hong Kong ($100–$150 vs $16–$20), or should we remove exact figures and say something like “local helpers earn much higher wages” because you don’t have a source? (Keep numbers — I will clean the phrasing; remove numbers — I will rewrite comparatively.)

Step 1 — Thesis revision
- Please confirm that this is the thesis sentence from your draft you want to change: “I do think governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights under this harsh phenomenon.”

Here is a suggested revised thesis you can accept, tweak, or use as a model:
- Suggested thesis: I strongly believe governments must enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because weak regulations lead to excessive working hours, unfair pay, and increased exploitation.

Why this is better (quick):
- Clear position (strong agreement), previews the three main points, and uses confident, grammatical language.

Would you like to:
A) Try rewriting the thesis yourself now (I’ll give feedback), or
B) Accept the suggested thesis and have me insert it into your full essay so we can move on to Step 2 (pay paragraph)?

If you pick B, also tell me whether to keep the Hong Kong numbers or not. Once you confirm, I will insert the thesis into your essay and we’ll pick the pay paragraph to revise its topic sentence next.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:41:56.798Z

**You:** Accept the suggested thesis

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:43:11.958Z

**Assistant:** Nice—thanks. I’ll follow your plan (focus on thesis clarity + cleaning the pay paragraph). You accepted the suggested thesis, so I’ve inserted it into your essay below (I only changed the thesis sentence so you can clearly see that edit).

Before we move on: quick check
- Confirmed goals for this session: A (thesis clarity/grammar) and C (make the pay paragraph’s evidence/data clearer). Is that still right?
- One quick question about the Hong Kong numbers: do you want me to keep the specific hourly figures ($100–$150 vs $16–$20) when we revise the pay paragraph, or would you prefer a general comparative phrasing (e.g., “local helpers earn much higher wages”)? Tell me which.

Recently, migrant workers face a host of difficulties in their daily life, ranging from weak regulations, enduring hours and unfair pay.

Step 2 — Topic sentence work (pay paragraph)
You said you want to focus on the pay paragraph next — great choice. The current topic sentence there is: “Let’s move on to the unfair pay problem.” Quick feedback on that opening:
- It’s informal and conversational (“Let’s move on…”), which weakens an academic tone.
- It doesn’t explicitly connect this paragraph to your thesis (that weak regulations cause unfair pay).
- There’s a punctuation issue: there should be a space after the period before “Migrant” and other small grammar fixes.

Your turn: please try revising the topic sentence now so it:
- Names the issue (unfair pay),
- Links it to weak regulations or employers’ practices (ties to thesis),
- Uses a more formal, academic tone.

If you’d like a little support, here are three short sentence starters you can complete or model (try writing your own first; pick one to finish):
- “Unfair pay is another direct consequence of weak regulations because…”
- “Another major problem is the low wages paid to migrant workers, as employers often…”
- “Weak regulations allow employers to pay migrant workers far less than local workers, for example…”

Try one revision now (one sentence). I’ll give quick feedback and then we’ll move to Step 3 to revise the rest of that paragraph’s sentences for clarity and grammar. Also tell me whether to keep the Hong Kong numbers when we revise the evidence sentence.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:43:42.113Z

**You:** Confirm session A. I want to keep the hourly figures

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:45:34.685Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming. Targets set: A (thesis clarity/grammar) and C (clean the pay paragraph); and you want to keep the Hong Kong hourly figures. I’ve inserted the clearer thesis into your essay below. Please read it and tell me if you’re satisfied with that thesis before we move on to Step 2.

Full essay with the revised thesis (only the thesis sentence was changed):
---
Recently, migrant workers face a host of difficulties in their daily life, ranging from weak regulations, enduring hours and unfair pay. I strongly believe governments must enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because weak regulations lead to excessive working hours, unfair pay, and increased exploitation.

let me tell about enduring hours first. Migrant workers usually work for over 10 hours a day. In their working hours, they are not allowed to have enough rest. Workers that work in factories are even worse, they may need to fulfill the “goal” set by the factory. As a result, they are required to have a longer working hours. But, is it fair? It is unfair to migrant workers. Long worker hours may increase the rate of accident due to the tirness of workers. Workers are not able to keep concentrating under a long time. 

Let’s move on to the unfair pay problem.Migrant workers usually get less salaries compare to other local workers even the job duties are the same. Use Hong Kong’s domestic helper as an example, a local helper can get around $100–$150 per an hour, while a migrant worker can only get around $16–$20 per an hour. it is totally unfair to the migrant workers. They also pay same effort to finish the same tasks, but their salaries are totally different.

Migrant workers exploitation due to weak regulations in additionally. They are not familiar with the language of their working city, and also the culture of their working city. They may also face discrimination and racist in their working environment.

To end with, I agree that governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights. Migrant workers help locals to did some kind of “nasty” works but they cannot get a fair benifits. By enforcing stricter laws, it can create a fairer working conditions and reduce barriers between local workers and migrant workers. The outcomes can positively to make the city become more sustainable and joyful.

Step 1 check (thesis)
- Do you feel this revised thesis communicates your position clearly and previews your three main points (hours, pay, exploitation)? If you’d like any change to tone or wording, tell me now — otherwise confirm and we’ll move to Step 2.

Step 2 — Topic sentence (pay paragraph)
- You chose the pay paragraph. Current opening: “Let’s move on to the unfair pay problem.” Quick feedback: it’s informal and doesn’t link clearly to your thesis (weak regulations → unfair pay). Also fix the punctuation (period + space) before “Migrant…”.

Your turn: please try revising the topic sentence now so it:
- Names the issue (unfair pay),
- Connects the issue to weak regulations or employers’ practices (ties to thesis),
- Uses a more formal, academic tone.

If you’d like a little help, here are three short starters you can finish (but try writing your own first):
- “Unfair pay is another direct consequence of weak regulations because…”
- “Another major problem is the low wages paid to migrant workers, as employers often…”
- “Weak regulations allow employers to pay migrant workers far less than local workers; for example, …”

(Reminder: keep the Hong Kong hourly figures in your paragraph — we’ll clean the sentence that presents them.)

Would you like to try a topic sentence now? I’ll give quick feedback and then we’ll revise the rest of that paragraph together.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:45:55.867Z

**You:** Use a more formal tone

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:47:33.379Z

**Assistant:** Nice—thanks. Quick check before we revise:

- Confirmed goals for this session: improve thesis clarity/grammar and clean the pay paragraph’s wording (and you want a more formal tone). Is that right? Also: you previously said to keep the Hong Kong hourly figures ($100–$150 vs $16–$20). Do you still want those numbers kept?

Step 1 — Thesis (your turn first)
- Here is the thesis currently in your essay:  
  “I strongly believe governments must enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because weak regulations lead to excessive working hours, unfair pay, and increased exploitation.”

Would you like to try making that sentence more formal yourself now? If so, try to:
- Use formal verbs (e.g., “should enact and enforce” instead of “must enforce”),
- Replace informal phrasing (“weak regulations”) with a more academic phrase (“inadequate regulation”),
- Keep the clear position and the preview of the three points.

If you’d like a model to use or tweak, here is a more formal alternative (you can accept it, change it, or try your own first):
- Model formal thesis: “Governments should enact and enforce stricter labor laws to protect migrant workers’ rights, since inadequate regulation contributes to excessive working hours, unjust pay, and increased exploitation.”

Do you want to:
A) Try a rewrite now (I’ll give feedback), or  
B) Accept the model above and have me insert it into your essay so we can move to Step 2 (pay paragraph topic sentence)?

Tell me A or B — and confirm whether to keep the Hong Kong figures. Once you confirm, we’ll finalize the thesis and move on to revise the pay paragraph’s topic sentence in a more formal, academic tone.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:47:46.767Z

**You:** B

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:48:37.397Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. I’ve inserted the model thesis you chose and kept the Hong Kong figures. Below is your full essay with only the thesis sentence changed (everything else left as you wrote it so we focus on one change at a time).

Step 2 — Topic sentence for the pay paragraph
- Current topic sentence: “Let’s move on to the unfair pay problem.”
- Quick feedback: It’s conversational and informal, and it doesn’t link this paragraph clearly to your thesis (that inadequate regulation causes unfair pay). Also fix the punctuation (add a space after the period) when you edit.

Please try rewriting that single topic sentence now so it:
- Names the issue (unfair pay),
- Connects the issue to inadequate regulation or employers’ practices (ties to the thesis),
- Uses a more formal tone.

Here are three short starters you can finish or use as a model (try writing your own first):
- “Unfair pay is another consequence of inadequate regulation because…”
- “Another major problem is the low wages paid to migrant workers, as employers often…”
- “Inadequate regulation allows employers to pay migrant workers far less than local workers; for example, …”

Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence now? I’ll give quick feedback and then we’ll revise the rest of that paragraph (clarify the Hong Kong example, clean grammar) in Step 3.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:48:54.898Z

**You:** Another major problem is the low wages paid to migrant workers, as migrant employers often get lower wages compare to local employees.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:51:52.685Z

**Assistant:** Nice try — good move naming the issue and trying to link it to the rest of the essay.

Quick, specific feedback on your sentence:
- Meaning: “migrant employers” is incorrect — you meant migrant workers (or “employers pay migrant workers”).
- Grammar: “compare” should be “compared” or use “than” in a comparison.
- Style: avoid repetition (“low wages… get lower wages”) and make the link to your thesis clearer (mention inadequate regulation or employers’ practices).
- Tone: make it slightly more formal for an academic essay.

Would you like to try revising the sentence again? If you’d like a model to use or tweak, here is a clear option you can accept or adjust:

- Model topic sentence: Another major problem is that employers often pay migrant workers far lower wages than local workers, a practice enabled by inadequate regulation.

Tell me:
- A) Do you want to use that sentence as-is, or
- B) Would you like to try another revision yourself first?

If you accept, I’ll insert it into your full essay and we’ll move to Step 3 to revise the rest of that paragraph (clean the Hong Kong example and fix grammar).

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:52:11.607Z

**You:** Another major problem is the low wages paid to migrant workers, as they often get lower salaries compared to local workers.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:54:14.441Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — you’ve made strong choices: a clearer thesis and a better topic sentence for the pay paragraph. I’ve inserted the new topic sentence into your essay below so you can see the change in context.

The outcomes can positively to make the city become more sustainable and joyful.

Step 3 — Revise the rest of this paragraph (supporting sentences)
Goal: keep the strengthened topic sentence and revise the supporting sentences so they clearly support it, are grammatical, and present the Hong Kong evidence clearly.

Quick diagnostic of each supporting sentence and focused suggestions (one small fix at a time)

1) Sentence: "Use Hong Kong’s domestic helper as an example, a local helper can get around $100–$150 per an hour, while a migrant worker can only get around $16–$20 per an hour."
- Problems: sentence structure is awkward; “Use … as an example” is an instruction rather than an integrated statement; “per an hour” → “per hour”; punctuation/clauses need smoothing.
- How to fix (starter you can finish): Begin with a linking phrase like “For example,” or “For instance,” and write one clear clause with the comparison. Try: For example, in Hong Kong, local domestic helpers may earn around $100–$150 per hour, whereas migrant workers often earn only $16–$20 per hour.
- Do you want to keep the numbers? (You said yes — good.) Use commas and “whereas” or “while” for a clean comparison.

2) Sentence: "it is totally unfair to the migrant workers."
- Problems: lowercase “it”; “totally” is informal/strong — better to use “unfair” or “unjust”; repetitive (you already said the pay is lower).
- Suggestion: tighten and connect to topic: For example, “This disparity is clearly unjust and shows how inadequate regulation allows wage discrimination.”

3) Sentence: "They also pay same effort to finish the same tasks, but their salaries are totally different."
- Problems: subject confusion (“They also pay same effort” — who pays?); grammar: “same effort” → “the same effort”; “totally different” is informal.
- How to fix: make the subject clear (migrant workers) and use correct phrasing: “Migrant workers put in the same effort and perform the same tasks as local workers, yet they receive much lower pay.”

General style and grammar tips for this paragraph
- Use consistent capitalization for sentence starts.
- Replace conversational phrases (“Use … as an example,” “it is totally unfair”) with formal connectors and precise adjectives (“For example,” “This disparity is unjust”).
- Watch verb forms and articles: “get less salaries” → “receive lower wages”; “compare to” → “compared to” or “than.”
- Avoid repeating the same idea with the same words; instead, explain why this matters briefly (e.g., “This wage gap undermines fairness and economic security for migrant workers.”)

Next step — your turn (short, stepwise)
- Option A (recommended): Try revising the first supporting sentence (the Hong Kong example) now using the starter I suggested. Paste just that one revised sentence here and I’ll give quick feedback.
- Option B: If you prefer, I can insert a cleaned version of the three supporting sentences into the essay for you — but I’ll only do that if you ask me to (and then I’ll show the full essay with those edits).

Which do you prefer? If you choose A, paste your single revised sentence and I’ll check it and help with the next sentence. If B, say “please revise and insert” and I’ll update the paragraph and give you the full essay.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:54:37.848Z

**You:** For instance, in Hong Kong, local domestic helpers may earn around $100-$150 per hour,while migrant workers often earn only $16-$20 per hour.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:59:22.053Z

**Assistant:** Nice — this is a clear improvement. Good job using “For instance” and keeping the numbers.

Quick, focused feedback:
- Add a space after the comma before “while.”
- Avoid the comma splice; use “whereas” or “while” with a comma before it: “…$100–$150 per hour, whereas migrant workers…”
- Consider marking the currency consistently (e.g., HK$) if that helps clarity.
- Use an en dash or hyphen consistently for ranges ($100–$150).

If you want a tidy suggested revision to copy or tweak, here it is (one sentence only):
- For instance, in Hong Kong, local domestic helpers may earn around $100–$150 per hour, whereas migrant workers often earn only $16–$20 per hour.

Would you like me to:
A) Insert that sentence into your full essay now and show the updated essay, or  
B) Let you try revising the next supporting sentence yourself (the one that begins “it is totally unfair…”), and I’ll give feedback?

Which do you prefer?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:59:36.891Z

**You:** I strongly believe this disparity is unjust.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:01:28.911Z

**Assistant:** Nice—good, clear sentence. Quick feedback:

- Tone: “I strongly believe this disparity is unjust.” is fine as a student voice, but in an academic essay it’s stronger to avoid “I” where possible. A tighter option: “This disparity is unjust.” or “This wage gap is unjust and shows how inadequate regulation enables wage discrimination.”
- Purpose: your sentence states the judgement clearly. You might later add a brief clause about why it matters (e.g., harms fairness or economic security).

Do you want to keep your sentence exactly as written, or would you prefer the slightly more formal alternative above? If you want it inserted, I’ll put it into the essay now and show the full revised text.

I’ll go ahead and insert your exact sentence into the paragraph below (no other changes), so you can see it in context. After that, we’ll revise the last supporting sentence together — would you like to try rewriting that sentence now?

Your turn: please try revising the last supporting sentence in that paragraph (currently: “They also pay same effort to finish the same tasks, but their salaries are totally different.”). Aim to:

- Make the subject clear (migrant workers),
- Use correct grammar (articles, verb forms),
- Link it to the wage gap (contrast) and keep formal tone.

Try one sentence and paste it here — I’ll give quick feedback and then we’ll finalize this paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:01:50.328Z

**You:** Migrant workers also pay the same effort to finish the same tasks, but their salaries are much lower than local workers.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:05:03.105Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that sentence makes the contrast clear and fixes the subject. Quick, focused feedback:

- “pay the same effort” is incorrect; use “put in the same effort,” “exert the same effort,” or “work just as hard.”
- For the comparison, use a clearer phrasing: “much lower than those of local workers” or “receive much lower pay.”
- You can drop “also” if it feels repetitive with the rest of the paragraph.

A concise, more natural option you can use or tweak:
- Migrant workers put in the same effort and perform the same tasks as local workers, yet they receive much lower pay.

Would you like me to insert that sentence into your essay now and show the full revised text?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:05:21.390Z

**You:** Yes

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:05:56.909Z

**Assistant:** Good work — that last sentence now reads much more clearly and supports the paragraph strongly. Below is your full essay with the revised thesis, the improved topic sentence for the pay paragraph, and the final supporting sentence you asked me to insert. I only changed those parts so you can see the edits in context.

Would you like to:
- Move on to polishing grammar and mechanics in this paragraph (capitalization, verb forms, spelling), or
- Work next on the hours paragraph or the conclusion?

Tell me which and we’ll continue step-by-step.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:06:15.156Z

**You:** Help me to improve all topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:07:40.407Z

**Assistant:** Nice goal — improving every topic sentence will make your essay clearer and easier to follow. A quick note about our process: we should stick to the agreed scope for this session (thesis + one body paragraph’s topic sentence + that paragraph’s content). You already revised the thesis and the pay paragraph topic sentence and support. I can:

- Option 1: Revise one more paragraph’s topic sentence for you now (pick the hours paragraph or the regulations/exploitation paragraph), and then help revise that paragraph’s supporting sentences; or
- Option 2: Coach you to improve all remaining topic sentences by giving short guidance and 2–3 model topic-sentence options for each paragraph so you can pick or adapt them yourself (I’ll encourage you to try your own version after).

Which would you like? If you want Option 1, tell me which paragraph to focus on next. If you want Option 2 (help for all), I’ve prepared concise models and quick tips below for each body paragraph’s topic sentence. Try one yourself after you read them.

Quick style guide for strong topic sentences
- Link each topic sentence to your thesis: show how the paragraph’s problem results from inadequate regulation or employers’ practices.
- Use formal academic tone (avoid “Let’s”, “let me tell”).
- Preview the paragraph’s focus briefly (cause, effect, or example).
- Keep it one clear sentence.

Models and short explanations

1) Hours paragraph (current content discusses long working hours and tiredness)
- Model A: Excessive working hours are a common consequence of inadequate regulation, leaving many migrant workers exhausted and at higher risk of accidents.
  - Why: Connects to thesis (inadequate regulation → hours), previews effects (exhaustion, accidents).
- Model B: One major problem is that migrant workers often face extremely long shifts, because weak enforcement lets employers demand excessive hours.
  - Why: Names the problem and points to the causal mechanism (weak enforcement).
- Model C: Inadequate labor protections allow employers to impose shifts of ten hours or more, which reduces worker safety and concentration.
  - Why: More specific (mentions 10+ hours), links to safety and concentration — good if you have that detail.

2) Regulations / exploitation paragraph (current content talks about language barriers, discrimination, weak laws)
- Model A: Weak legal protections and language barriers increase migrant workers’ vulnerability to exploitation and discrimination.
  - Why: Names both regulation and barriers as causes and previews outcomes.
- Model B: Because many migrants do not speak the local language and lack legal safeguards, they are more likely to suffer wage theft and discriminatory treatment.
  - Why: Specifies mechanisms (language + lack of safeguards) and outcomes (wage theft, discrimination).
- Model C: Inadequate regulation permits employers to exploit migrant workers’ unfamiliarity with local laws and customs, worsening social and workplace discrimination.
  - Why: Emphasizes employer behavior and social effects; good if you want to stress exploitation as a systemic issue.

How to pick and adapt a model
- If you want to emphasize facts (e.g., “10+ hours”), choose Model C for hours.  
- If you want a general academic tone without numbers, pick Model A for each paragraph.  
- After you choose one, try to write it into your draft exactly as one sentence. I’ll give fast feedback and then — if you want — insert it into your essay.

Quick next step (pick one)
- Option 1: Tell me which paragraph to revise now (hours or regulations) and I’ll help revise its topic sentence and then the paragraph’s support.  
- Option 2: Choose one model sentence from above for each paragraph (hours and regulations), paste them or your own attempt here, and I’ll give feedback on each.

Which do you want to do?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:07:57.463Z

**You:** Option 2

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:09:17.182Z

**Assistant:** Great — Option 2 it is. Nice choice: I’ll give short, usable model topic sentences and quick tips for both remaining body paragraphs (hours and regulations). Then you can pick one or try your own; paste your two sentences here and I’ll give fast feedback.

Quick reminder about scope
- We’ve already revised the thesis and fully revised the pay paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences). Here I’ll only give model topic sentences and brief guidance for the hours paragraph and the regulations/exploitation paragraph so you can adapt them yourself.

Hours paragraph — models and why they work
- Model 1: Excessive working hours are a common consequence of inadequate regulation, leaving many migrant workers exhausted and at greater risk of accidents.
  - Why: Links to thesis (inadequate regulation → hours) and previews effects (exhaustion, accidents).
- Model 2: One major problem is that migrant workers often face shifts of ten hours or more because weak enforcement lets employers demand excessive work.
  - Why: More specific (10+ hours) and mentions the causal mechanism (weak enforcement).
- Model 3: Inadequate labor protections allow employers to require long, uninterrupted shifts, which reduce workers’ concentration and increase accident risk.
  - Why: Focuses on mechanism and consequences (concentration, safety).

Tips to adapt for your voice
- Keep one clear cause or effect in the sentence (e.g., “because weak enforcement…”).
- Use formal verbs (allow, enable, contribute to) and avoid “let me tell” or “Let’s move on.”
- If you include the “10 hours” detail later in the paragraph, you can still mention it here for clarity.

Regulations/exploitation paragraph — models and why they work
- Model 1: Weak legal protections and language barriers increase migrant workers’ vulnerability to exploitation and discrimination.
  - Why: Names both causes (weak laws, language) and outcomes (exploitation, discrimination).
- Model 2: Because many migrant workers lack familiarity with local laws and language, they are more likely to experience wage theft and unfair treatment.
  - Why: Specifies mechanisms and concrete outcomes (wage theft, unfair treatment).
- Model 3: Inadequate regulation allows employers to exploit migrants’ unfamiliarity with local customs and legal rights, worsening workplace discrimination.
  - Why: Emphasizes employer behavior as the driver and links to discrimination.

Quick revision checklist for each topic sentence
- Link to the thesis: mention “inadequate regulation,” “weak enforcement,” or “employers’ practices.”
- One sentence, one clear idea.
- Formal tone: avoid contractions, “let me,” or “I.”
- If you use a number (e.g., 10 hours), keep it concise and accurate.

Your turn (short)
- Pick one model for each paragraph or write your own two topic sentences (hours + regulations).  
- Paste both sentences here and I’ll give quick, focused feedback (one to two brief suggestions each).

You’re doing well — small precise changes now will make the whole essay stronger. Ready when you are.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:09:31.164Z

**You:** Model 2

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:11:14.274Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing Model 2 for the hours paragraph. That’s a strong, specific option.

Here’s the Model 2 sentence again, slightly polished for formal tone:
- One major problem is that migrant workers often face shifts of ten hours or more because weak enforcement lets employers demand excessive work.

Would you like me to:
A) Insert that sentence into your full essay now (I’ll show the full essay with only that topic sentence changed), or  
B) Try writing your own topic sentence now (I’ll give quick feedback), or  
C) Move on to help you revise the supporting sentences in the hours paragraph after we confirm the topic sentence?

Pick A, B, or C and I’ll proceed.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:11:26.064Z

**You:** C

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:12:00.303Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing C. We’ll revise the supporting sentences in the hours paragraph now.

Quick confirmation
- Topic sentence we’ll use: One major problem is that migrant workers often face shifts of ten hours or more because weak enforcement lets employers demand excessive work.
- Goal for Step 3: Make the paragraph’s support clear, logical, and grammatical — keep the topic sentence, improve each supporting sentence so it connects to it and reads naturally.

How we’ll work (short and focused)
1. You try revising one supporting sentence now (start with the first sentence after the topic sentence).  
2. I’ll give concise, focused feedback and suggest small phrase-level fixes (I won’t replace the whole paragraph for you).  
3. We’ll repeat sentence-by-sentence until the paragraph is clean. When you want, I’ll insert the revised sentences into the full essay and show the updated text.

Guiding questions for each supporting sentence
- Does this sentence clearly explain or illustrate why long hours happen or why they matter? (cause or effect)
- Does the wording flow and use correct grammar (articles, verb forms, plurals)?
- Are there shorter, clearer words you can use for awkward phrases (e.g., “fulfill the goal” → “meet production targets”)?

Common, bite-sized fixes to watch for (apply these as you revise)
- Capitalize sentence starts and proper nouns. Remove conversational openings like “let me tell.”  
- Use nouns/phrases that are precise: “factory workers” (not “workers that work in factories”), “production targets” (instead of “goal”), “longer working hours” (not “a longer working hours”).  
- Fix verb forms and agreement: “are not allowed to have enough rest” → ensure subject-verb match and consider “do not get enough rest.”  
- Replace informal words: “tirness” → “tiredness” or “fatigue”; “keep concentrating” → “maintain concentration.”  
- Combine short, choppy sentences into clearer pairs when they explain cause → effect.

Now your turn (one sentence)
- Please paste your revised version of the first supporting sentence in the hours paragraph (the sentence that gives the “10 hours” detail and/or explains lack of rest). Keep it to one sentence. I’ll give quick feedback and a couple of small edits you can apply.

If you prefer, you can paste the entire paragraph as you currently have it and I’ll point to the 2–3 small changes to make — but I recommend we do it one sentence at a time so it’s manageable under test-time constraints.

Ready when you are — paste your first revised sentence.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:12:16.509Z

**You:** Keep the topic sentence. Insert the improved sentence for me and move to step 5

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:15:15.619Z

**Assistant:** Done — I inserted the improved supporting sentence into the hours paragraph and kept the topic sentence as you asked. Here is the full essay with that one change shown in context.

Full revised essay (only the thesis, the pay paragraph, and the hours paragraph supporting sentence were changed in this session):

---
Recently, migrant workers face a host of difficulties in their daily life, ranging from weak regulations, enduring hours and unfair pay. Governments should enact and enforce stricter labor laws to protect migrant workers’ rights, since inadequate regulation contributes to excessive working hours, unjust pay, and increased exploitation.

One major problem is that migrant workers often face shifts of ten hours or more because weak enforcement lets employers demand excessive work. Many migrant workers routinely work more than ten hours a day without adequate breaks, particularly in factories where employers demand high production targets. In their working hours, they are not allowed to have enough rest. Workers that work in factories are even worse, they may need to fulfill the “goal” set by the factory. As a result, they are required to have a longer working hours. But, is it fair? It is unfair to migrant workers. Long worker hours may increase the rate of accident due to the tirness of workers. Workers are not able to keep concentrating under a long time. 

Another major problem is the low wages paid to migrant workers, as they often get lower salaries compared to local workers. For instance, in Hong Kong, local domestic helpers may earn around $100–$150 per hour, whereas migrant workers often earn only $16–$20 per hour. I strongly believe this disparity is unjust. Migrant workers put in the same effort and perform the same tasks as local workers, yet they receive much lower pay.

Migrant workers exploitation due to weak regulations in additionally. They are not familiar with the language of their working city, and also the culture of their working city. They may also face discrimination and racist in their working environment.

To end with, I agree that governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights. Migrant workers help locals to did some kind of “nasty” works but they cannot get a fair benifits. By enforcing stricter laws, it can create a fairer working conditions and reduce barriers between local workers and migrant workers. The outcomes can positively to make the city become more sustainable and joyful.
---

Next: you asked to "move to step 5." Could you clarify what you mean by Step 5 here? I can proceed in a few ways — pick one:

- Option A: Polish grammar/mechanics in the hours paragraph (fix capitalization, verb forms, spelling like “tirness”) only for this paragraph.
- Option B: Move to revising the conclusion paragraph (keep within our scope rule — I can coach you but not fully rewrite it).
- Option C: I can give a short checklist of final edits you can make quickly under test conditions (high-impact, time-saving grammar fixes).
- Option D: If you meant “finish” the session, I can summarize the changes we made and list quick next steps to apply in future timed tests.

Tell me A, B, C, or D (or explain another Step 5) and I’ll proceed.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:15:37.886Z

**You:** D and correct all my grammatically mistakes

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:17:05.462Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — great choice to finish and focus on accuracy. Before I make the edits, a quick reminder about our agreed scope: in this session I can revise the thesis and one body paragraph (topic sentence + that paragraph’s supporting sentences). You asked me to correct “all my grammatical mistakes,” but I’ll stick to that scope so you can learn the most important, test-focused edits now.

What I will do now
- Correct grammar, punctuation, spelling, capitalization, and wording only in:
  1) the thesis sentence, and  
  2) the entire pay paragraph (the body paragraph we focused on: topic sentence + supporting sentences).  
- I will leave the other paragraphs as they were in your latest draft so you can review the focused changes.  
- After the revised essay, I’ll list the most important remaining grammar mistakes elsewhere and a short checklist you can use under test time.

Here is your full essay with only the thesis and the pay paragraph corrected and polished:

Quick note on what I changed in the revised parts
- Thesis: made the verb formal and clear (“Governments should enact and enforce…”) and used “inadequate regulation” and a concise preview of the three points.
- Pay paragraph:
  - Rewrote the topic sentence to link the paragraph to the thesis and use a formal tone.
  - Rephrased the Hong Kong example into a single clear comparative sentence (corrected “per an hour” and punctuation).
  - Replaced informal judgments with a concise sentence (“This disparity is unjust.”).
  - Rewrote the contrast sentence to make subject and verb clear (migrant workers put in the same effort … yet they receive much lower pay).

Remaining major errors elsewhere (things you can fix quickly)
- Capitalization: Sentences must start with a capital letter (e.g., “let me tell…” → “Let me tell…”). Start every sentence with a capital.
- Verb forms and tenses: Use consistent, correct forms (e.g., “face” → “have faced” or “face”; “help locals to did” → “help locals by doing” or “do”).
- Articles and plurals: “a longer working hours” → “longer working hours” or “a longer working day”; “get less salaries” → “receive lower wages.”
- Word choice/spelling: “tirness” → “tiredness” or “fatigue”; “benifits” → “benefits”; “racist” (noun) → “racism” or “racial discrimination.”
- Sentence fragments and comma splices: combine or split sentences correctly (use periods or coordinating conjunctions).
- Informal phrases: avoid “Let’s move on,” “let me tell,” “totally,” in academic writing.

Quick test-time proofreading checklist (use this under time pressure)
1. Capital letters: scan first words of sentences — fix any lowercase starts.  
2. Verb problems: look for obvious wrong verb forms (did/done, help to did → helped/did).  
3. Articles & plurals: check “a/an/the” and plural -s where needed.  
4. Spelling: check 3 frequent words you misspell (tiredness, benefits, exploitation).  
5. Punctuation: ensure spaces after periods and commas; fix comma splices by adding periods.  
6. One final read: read each sentence aloud slowly — if it sounds odd, simplify it.

Would you like me to
- (A) Continue and correct the other paragraphs now (full grammar pass), or  
- (B) Coach you through applying the quick checklist to each remaining paragraph step-by-step (so you learn to fix them in a timed test)?

Tell me A or B. If you pick A, I’ll do a full grammatical edit of the entire essay and return the fully polished version. If you pick B, we’ll continue step-by-step and I’ll prompt you to fix short sections with quick feedback.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:17:42.212Z

**You:** A

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:19:36.708Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — you picked A, and I’m glad you want a full clean-up. I need to stick to our agreed scope for this session, though: I can only revise the thesis plus one body paragraph (its topic sentence and the rest of that paragraph). I can’t perform a full grammatical edit of the entire essay for you in one go.

That said, I can still help immediately in two useful ways. Pick one:

Option 1 — Guided, step-by-step coaching (recommended)
- I’ll coach you through fixing the rest of the essay one small piece at a time. You paste one sentence or a short paragraph (up to 2–3 sentences) and I’ll give concise, targeted corrections and a short model of how to improve it. You make the change, paste the next piece, and we repeat. This lets you learn quick, test-friendly fixes and keeps us within scope rules.

Option 2 — High-impact correction checklist + exact, line-level suggestions
- I’ll give a short prioritized list of specific edits to apply to each remaining paragraph (the hours paragraph beyond what we already fixed, the exploitation paragraph, and the conclusion). I’ll point to the most frequent errors and show 3–6 exact fixes you can apply quickly under time pressure (for example: change “tirness” → “tiredness”; “let me tell” → delete/replace). I won’t rewrite entire paragraphs for you, but you’ll get clear, copy-paste style instructions you can apply fast.

Which would you like — Option 1 (coaching, you paste small chunks and I give fixes) or Option 2 (priority checklist + exact edits)? If you pick Option 1, tell me which short piece you want to start with (the rest of the hours paragraph, the regulations/exploitation paragraph, or the conclusion). If you pick Option 2, I’ll send the prioritized checklist and the exact edits for the remaining paragraphs right away.

Either way, quick reminder of three top, test-focused things to fix everywhere:
1) Capitalization at the start of every sentence.  
2) Subject-verb forms and article use (e.g., “a longer working hours” → “longer working hours” or “a longer working day”).  
3) Common spellings: tirness → tiredness; benifits → benefits; racist (noun) → racism or “racial discrimination.”

Tell me Option 1 or Option 2 and which paragraph you want to begin with (if Option 1). I’ll proceed.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:20:00.043Z

**You:** Option 2

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:21:14.069Z

**Assistant:** Good — Option 2 it is. Below is a short, high-impact checklist followed by exact, copy-paste line edits you can apply quickly to the remaining paragraphs (hours paragraph remaining lines, exploitation paragraph, and the conclusion). Apply these replacements directly in your draft.

High-priority, fast checklist (apply in this order)
1. Capitalization: Make sure every sentence begins with a capital letter.  
2. Verb forms & agreement: Fix subject-verb problems (e.g., “they are not allowed” → check tense; “help… did” → “help… do/doing”).  
3. Articles & plurals: Fix “a/an/the” and plural -s errors (“a longer working hours” → “longer working hours”).  
4. Spelling: tirness → tiredness, benifits → benefits, racist (noun) → racism.  
5. Remove informal phrases: Replace “let me tell,” “Let’s move on,” “totally,” “to end with” with formal alternatives.  
6. Punctuation & spacing: Ensure a space after every period, comma splices fixed (split or use conjunctions).

Exact line-level edits (copy these into your draft)

Hours paragraph — replace these sentences one by one
- Current: “In their working hours, they are not allowed to have enough rest.”  
  Replace with: “They do not get adequate rest during their shifts.”  

- Current: “Workers that work in factories are even worse, they may need to fulfill the “goal” set by the factory.”  
  Replace with: “Factory workers are worse off: they may be required to meet high production targets.”  

- Current: “As a result, they are required to have a longer working hours.”  
  Replace with: “As a result, they are required to work longer hours.”  

- Current: “But, is it fair? It is unfair to migrant workers.”  
  Replace with (single sentence): “This practice is clearly unfair to migrant workers.”  

- Current: “Long worker hours may increase the rate of accident due to the tirness of workers.”  
  Replace with: “Long working hours increase the risk of workplace accidents because of worker fatigue.”  

- Current: “Workers are not able to keep concentrating under a long time.”  
  Replace with: “Workers cannot maintain concentration for long periods.”  

Exploitation / regulations paragraph — replace these sentences
- Current: “Migrant workers exploitation due to weak regulations in additionally.”  
  Replace with: “Migrant workers are often exploited because of weak regulations.”  

- Current: “They are not familiar with the language of their working city, and also the culture of their working city.”  
  Replace with: “Many migrant workers do not speak the local language or understand local customs.”  

- Current: “They may also face discrimination and racist in their working environment.”  
  Replace with: “They may also face discrimination and racism in the workplace.”  

Optional (one-line) add-on to tie this paragraph to thesis (paste after above):  
- Add: “These factors make migrants more vulnerable to abuse, wage theft, and unfair treatment.”

Conclusion — replace these sentences
- Current: “To end with, I agree that governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights.”  
  Replace with: “To conclude, governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights.”  

- Current: “Migrant workers help locals to did some kind of “nasty” works but they cannot get a fair benifits.”  
  Replace with: “Migrant workers often perform difficult or undesirable tasks but do not receive fair compensation or benefits.”  

- Current: “By enforcing stricter laws, it can create a fairer working conditions and reduce barriers between local workers and migrant workers.”  
  Replace with: “Enforcing stricter laws can create fairer working conditions and reduce barriers between local and migrant workers.”  

- Current: “The outcomes can positively to make the city become more sustainable and joyful.”  
  Replace with: “These changes can make cities more equitable and sustainable for everyone.”  

Quick note on tone and cohesion
- Remove phrases that directly address the reader (“let me tell,” “Let’s move on”). Use transitional words: “First,” “Another major problem,” “For instance,” and “Finally” or “To conclude.”  
- Keep sentences short and direct under timed conditions. If a sentence feels long, split it into two.

Would you like me to
- (A) apply these exact replacements and return the fully revised essay now, or  
- (B) coach you through applying them one paragraph at a time (you paste the paragraph after edits and I’ll check)?

If you want the full revised version, I’ll paste it with these exact edits applied.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:21:44.807Z

**You:** Factories workers are worse off: they may be required to meet high production targets.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:23:54.428Z

**Assistant:** Nice revision — good clarity and stronger phrasing.

One small fix: use the singular adjective form “Factory workers” (not “Factories workers”). Here’s the corrected sentence:

- Factory workers are worse off: they may be required to meet high production targets.

Would you like me to:
A) Insert this corrected sentence into your essay now and show the updated paragraph in context, or  
B) Help you revise the next sentence in the hours paragraph yourself (paste it here), or  
C) Move on to the exploitation/regulations paragraph topic sentence models?

Tell me A, B, or C and we’ll continue.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:24:05.306Z

**You:** A

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:24:25.319Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’ve inserted the corrected sentence into your essay and show the updated paragraph in context below. Nice clear fix — that sentence reads much more natural and formal now.

Next step — pick one:
- A) I can apply the rest of the high-impact exact edits I suggested earlier to finish cleaning the hours paragraph (quick, focused fixes for the remaining sentences).  
- B) I can coach you to make those specific edits yourself (you paste one sentence and I give a short correction).  
- C) Move on to revise the exploitation/regulations paragraph next.

Which would you like?

What I changed in the hours paragraph
- Strengthened the topic sentence and kept its link to the thesis (inadequate regulation → excessive hours).  
- Replaced awkward phrasing with clear, grammatical sentences about long shifts, lack of breaks, production targets, fatigue, and accident risk.  
- Removed informal language and combined ideas where that improved clarity.

Quick suggestion for next step (one small edit you can do fast)
- Apply the exact edits from my earlier checklist to the exploitation/regulations paragraph and the conclusion (capitalization, verb forms, spelling like “tirness” → “tiredness”, “benifits” → “benefits”, and change “racist” → “racism” or “racial discrimination”). If you want, paste one of those paragraphs here and I’ll give the exact one-line replacements.

Would you like me to:
A) Apply the exact checklist edits now to the exploitation paragraph and conclusion (one more focused pass), or  
B) Coach you step-by-step to fix them (you paste one paragraph and I give targeted edits)?

Pick A or B and I’ll proceed.

**You:** It is ok, thank you

*Time:* 2025-12-06T17:27:24.447Z

**Assistant:** You’re welcome — glad it helped! Quick recap and tiny next steps so you can keep improving:

What we finished today
- Clarified and strengthened the thesis so it states your position and previews the three main points (hours, pay, exploitation).  
- Revised the pay paragraph (better topic sentence, clearer Hong Kong example, stronger supporting sentences).  
- Revised the hours paragraph (new topic sentence plus clearer, grammatical supporting sentences).

Three quick, test-friendly reminders
- Capitalization: start every sentence with a capital letter.  
- High-frequency corrections: tirness → tiredness, benifits → benefits, racist → racism (or “racial discrimination”); “per an hour” → “per hour.”  
- Short proofreading checklist (30–60 sec): capitals → verb forms → articles/plurals → 3 common spellings → punctuation/spacing.

If you want more
- I can coach you through polishing the remaining paragraphs step-by-step, or do a focused full grammar pass if you paste the final essay and confirm you want me to edit everything.  
- We can also run a short timed practice where you write a paragraph in 10–15 minutes and I give quick edits to simulate test conditions.

Well done on the clear ideas and concrete examples — those are strong foundations. If you’re ready to continue later, paste the next paragraph you want help with or tell me which option above you prefer.
