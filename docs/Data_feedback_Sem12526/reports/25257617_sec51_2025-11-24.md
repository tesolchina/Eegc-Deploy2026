            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing the detailed training assessment report and chat history. Here is a concise summary and suggested next steps tailored for your use:

---

### Summary of Session & Issues Identified

- **Essay Revision:**  
  - The student did not submit actual revised thesis or topic sentences despite multiple prompts.  
  - Placeholders (“bla bla bla”, “let’s pretend”) were used instead of real text, preventing meaningful feedback on revisions.  
  - As a result, there was no measurable improvement; many original issues persist in grammar, vocabulary, and organization.

- **Human-AI Interaction:**  
  - The assistant gave structured, clear step-by-step revision scaffolds aligned with course standards.  
  - The student replied frequently but avoided substantive engagement or real edits.  
  - Critical input such as revising or confirming thesis/topic sentences was absent.  
  - Attempts to proceed skipped essential steps, breaking the revision workflow.

- **Skills Gaps Observed:**  
  - Providing actual revision content (context provision).  
  - Strategic iterative editing (following the stepwise process).  
  - Critical evaluation of AI suggestions rather than passivity or “pretend” replies.  
  - Independent editing to address recurring errors and strengthen clarity.

---

### Recommendations for Moving Forward

1. **Require Mandatory Submission of Revised Text:**  
   Before continuing, ask the student to paste a concrete revised thesis sentence and one fully revised topic sentence (linked to that thesis). This is the minimal evidence needed to assess their ability to apply AI suggestions.

2. **Structured Prompts to Support Revision:**  
   Provide clear scaffold frames again (see example below) and require the student to complete them with actual text.

   Example thesis frame:  
   *“I partly agree that individuals matter less than governments and companies in fighting climate change because [policy influence], and because [personal choices affect markets/social norms].”*

   Example topic sentence frame (paragraph 1):  
   *“Individuals influence government policy by [voting, protesting], which leads to [stricter environmental laws].”*

3. **Encourage Incremental Revision:**  
   Ask for one revised paragraph at a time, with explanations for changes. For example, “Please paste your revised paragraph 1 so I can check evidence, logic, and language.”

4. **Set Clear Expectations for Engagement:**  
   Explain that “pretend” responses do not help learning or get feedback. Encourage risk-taking with real attempts and use of the scaffolds.

5. **Focus on Grammar and Clarity:**  
   After the content and structure improve, target frequent grammar problems with mini-exercises or sentence-level edits.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The essay has a clear stance (partial agreement) and relevant, logical points (influence on government; personal habits). Examples are present but general and not strongly developed (“if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment…”).
- Organization: 21/25 - Clear paragraphing (introduction, two body paragraphs, conclusion) and logical progression, though transitions and internal paragraph coherence are sometimes weak.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary is adequate and appropriate for the topic but basic; some repetition and lack of precise topic-specific terms.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 17/25 - Generally understandable but several grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and informal constructions that lower clarity (e.g., “so is not always working well,” “nothing happen,” “so this is problem”).
- **Original Essay Total: 76/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 16/25 - The revised version contains placeholders (e.g., “(revised thesis statement here)”) and repeated original passages; the core thesis/topic sentences were not actually supplied, so the revision is incomplete and content is weaker.
- Organization: 18/25 - The structural outline remains, but missing thesis and incomplete paragraph revisions reduce coherence and completeness.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - No meaningful vocabulary improvement is visible; language remains basic where present.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 17/25 - Many original grammatical issues persist in the unchanged passages; placeholders interrupt flow.
- **Revised Essay Total: 69/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -7 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None substantive — the student did not submit actual revised thesis/topic sentence/body-paragraph content for evaluation. The draft retains most original text.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Revise and present a focused thesis that previews the two essay points with confident wording.
  - Provide a clear, assertive topic sentence for one body paragraph and a complete revised paragraph showing improved evidence and linkage.
  - Address recurring grammar errors and replace informal phrases (e.g., “nothing happen,” “is problem”) with corrected sentences.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 18** (18 messages in the provided chat history; multiple assistant prompts and repeated user replies).
- **Conversation Quality:** High number of turns but low student engagement with substantive revision. The assistant repeatedly requested a revised thesis and topic sentence; the student repeatedly replied with “let’s pretend we have revised…” or “bla bla bla”, and did not paste actual revisions. Example user messages: “let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement” / “let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on bla bla bla …”. Assistant prompts repeatedly asked the student to paste the revised thesis/topic sentence before proceeding.

#### Interaction Scores:
- In-Depth Conversation: 3/5 - Although there were many turns (18), the exchanges lack depth from the student side. The assistant provided structured guidance and scaffolds, but the student did not supply the substantive revised text or detailed questions. Evidence: repeated assistant scaffolding messages (e.g., guidance on thesis and topic-sentence frames) with user responses that avoid providing actual revisions.
- Critical Review of AI Suggestions: 1/5 - The student did not meaningfully evaluate, accept, or reject the AI's suggestions. Instead of pasting a revised thesis or topic sentence for critique, the student repeatedly used “let’s pretend…” and did not justify choices. Evidence: assistant requests (“Could you paste your new thesis sentence here?”) remained unanswered with actual content.
- Refining Process: 1/5 - There is no documented iterative revision of the essay content by the student. The assistant repeatedly requested the thesis and paragraph text to revise; the student did not follow through with real edits. Evidence: placeholders in the revised essay and repeated user avoidance in the chat (“bla bla bla …”, “let's pretend we have revised…”).
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 5/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student understands the high-level structure of revision: the assistant’s messages show the correct process (thesis → topic sentences → paragraph revising).
- The student engaged in the session (multiple replies), indicating willingness to work with the AI even if substantive edits were not supplied.
- The assistant’s scaffolding was thorough and course-aligned; the student had access to clear, actionable steps.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Provide actual revised text when asked (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph) so the assistant can offer concrete feedback.
- Move from “pretend” responses to real edits — paste the revised sentences/paragraphs into the chat.
- Address recurring grammar and clarity issues by applying the assistant’s guidance (reduce hedging, fix verb forms, correct subject-verb agreement, eliminate informal fillers).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Needs Improvement - The student did not supply the revised thesis or targeted paragraph content despite repeated prompts. Evidence: assistant’s numerous requests for the thesis were not answered with actual text.
- Strategic Planning: Needs Improvement - The student did not follow the recommended stepwise revision process in substance; they acknowledged the steps but did not execute them with real text.
- Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement - There is no evidence the student critically evaluated AI suggestions; they did not accept, reject, or modify the assistant’s specific scaffolds.
- Independent Editing: Needs Improvement - No independent edits are visible; the revised essay contains placeholders rather than revised content.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Paste concrete revisions into the chat when the assistant asks for the thesis, topic sentence, or paragraph. Even short attempts allow the assistant to give focused feedback.
2. Follow the assistant’s scaffold precisely: write a concise thesis that previews two points, then supply one topic sentence and the full paragraph to revise.
3. Address grammar issues by applying targeted edits (remove fillers, correct verb forms, tighten sentences) and ask the assistant to check specific sentences rather than asking to “pretend” they are revised.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student interacted frequently but did not produce actual revisions requested by the AI assistant. This limits the ability to assess improvement and to practice AI-assisted revision skills.
- Recommend an instructor prompt or brief required submission: the student must paste a revised thesis sentence, one revised topic sentence, and a fully revised body paragraph before the next assessment. This will enable meaningful feedback and demonstrate progress in AI collaboration.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. bla bla bla ... ... (revised thesis statement here)

*Time:* 2025-11-24T14:18:13.284Z

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-24T13:25:57.922Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-24T13:27:42.224Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I can see your current thesis at the end. Let’s work on making it clearer, stronger, and more focused before we move on.

First, a quick check: is this the thesis you want to revise now?
"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Feedback on clarity, strength, and focus
- Clarity: The main point (partial agreement) is clear, but the sentence is long and a bit repetitive (“also,” “at the same time”).
- Strength: “Partly agree” is okay, but the wording is hedged and passive. Use more confident phrasing and active verbs.
- Focus: The thesis mentions two ideas (influence on government; personal lifestyle choices) but it does not preview how you will support them. A stronger thesis briefly states the two main reasons you will discuss.
- Language issues: Remove filler words (e.g., “which is very important,” “also”) and avoid vague phrases (“still have a role to play”). Use precise terms like “influence policy,” “shape market demand,” or “create social pressure.”

Revision guidance (not a full rewrite — scaffolding you can use)
- Start with a confident stance: “I partly agree” or “I agree to some extent” (then explain why).
- Preview two clear supporting points: reason A (how individuals influence government/policy) and reason B (how personal choices affect markets/social norms/collective behaviour).
- Use active verbs and concise language.

Scaffold you can copy and complete:
- Opening (stance): I partly agree that individual actions are less powerful than government and corporate efforts because…
- Reason 1 (policy influence): …individuals can influence policy by ______ (e.g., voting, protesting, public pressure)…
- Reason 2 (market/social influence): …and their choices can shape market demand and social norms by ______ (e.g., consumer behaviour, community example)…

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using that scaffold? When you post your revised thesis, I’ll give focused feedback and we’ll only move on once you’re happy with it.

*Time:* 2025-11-24T13:28:49.354Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-24T13:32:07.051Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for moving forward. Before we start on a paragraph, I need to confirm the revised thesis (Step 1). Could you paste your new thesis sentence here so I can check it quickly? If you prefer, briefly tell me its main wording and the two points it previews.

Quick checklist for your revised thesis (to check against what you give me):
- Clearly answers the question (agree, disagree, or partly agree).
- Previews the two main reasons you will discuss (e.g., policy influence; market/social change).
- Uses confident, precise language (no “maybe,” “I think,” or repeated hedges).

Once you paste the revised thesis and I confirm we’re happy with it, pick one body paragraph to work on (Paragraph 2 — influence on government, or Paragraph 3 — personal lifestyle changes). Then paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence.

Hints for revising the topic sentence (I will not rewrite it for you, just guide):
- Make one clear claim that directly links to your thesis point (policy influence OR market/social influence).
- Show cause → effect: state how the individual action leads to a specific outcome (e.g., policy change, market pressure).
- Keep it concise and assertive.

Two short revision frames you can use to build your new topic sentence (fill the blanks):
- “[Individuals/Ordinary citizens] influence government policy by ______, which leads to ______.”
- “Personal lifestyle choices affect companies and social norms because ______, resulting in ______.”

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now? Paste your revised thesis first, then the topic sentence you want to work on. I’ll give focused feedback and we’ll only move on when you’re satisfied.

*Time:* 2025-11-24T13:32:28.187Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on
bla bla bla ...

*Time:* 2025-11-24T13:53:30.359Z

**Assistant:** Great — before we move on, I need one quick confirmation (Step 1, mandatory).

1) Please paste your revised thesis sentence here, or just confirm that you are satisfied with the revision. I can’t continue to the paragraph work until you confirm the thesis previews the two main points and uses confident language.

When you confirm, pick one body paragraph to work on (Step 2):
- Paragraph 2 = individuals influencing government/policy
- Paragraph 3 = personal lifestyle changes affecting companies/social norms

Then paste the current topic sentence for that paragraph.

Quick guidance for the topic sentence (how it must link to the thesis)
- It should make one clear claim that directly supports your thesis.
- It should show a cause → effect or explain how the individual action leads to a visible result (e.g., policy change, market response, social pressure).
- Keep it concise and assertive.

Two short frames you can use to build the new topic sentence (fill the blanks)
- “[Ordinary citizens/individuals] influence government policy by ______, which leads to ______.”
- “Personal lifestyle choices affect companies and social norms because ______, resulting in ______.”

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now? Paste your revised thesis (or confirm it), choose a paragraph, and paste its current topic sentence — then I’ll give focused feedback and prompts to improve it.

*Time:* 2025-11-24T13:54:10.650Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on 
bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-11-24T13:56:30.993Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — let’s follow the three-step process, starting with the mandatory thesis check.

Step 1 — Thesis
Please paste your revised thesis sentence here (the one you want to use in the final draft). If you prefer, simply confirm that you are satisfied with this revision:
"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Quick, focused feedback on that version (before you paste a revision)
- What’s good: it shows a clear stance (partial agreement) and mentions two supporting ideas (influence on government; personal choices).
- What to improve: it is wordy and hedged (remove repeated hedges like “also,” “at the same time”). Make the two supporting points more precise and preview how you will support them (for example: “influence policy” and “shape market demand/social norms”).
- Use confident verbs and concise phrasing (avoid “still have a role to play”).

Tiny scaffold you can fill in (do not copy me exactly — use your own words):
- “I partly agree that individuals are less powerful than governments and corporations, but they remain important because [how individuals influence policy], and because [how personal choices affect markets/social norms].”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Paste your revision and I’ll give quick targeted feedback. I can’t move on until you confirm the thesis previews the two points and uses confident language.

Step 2 — Topic sentence (quick check)
When you paste your revised thesis, also tell me which paragraph you want to work on:
- Paragraph 2 = individuals influencing government/policy
- Paragraph 3 = personal lifestyle changes affecting companies/social norms

Paste the topic sentence for that paragraph (or confirm you have already revised it). I’ll check how well it links to the thesis and give one or two short suggestions to strengthen the connection.

Step 3 — Revising the rest of that paragraph
After we agree the thesis and topic sentence, paste the full paragraph you want to revise. I will:
- Ask 2–3 focused questions about the paragraph’s evidence and logic (e.g., “Does this example show how citizens caused policy change?”).
- Point out any sentences that are off-topic, vague, or repetitive.
- Suggest where to add a brief explanation, clearer link to the topic sentence, or a stronger example (I will not rewrite sentences for you).
- Highlight language to tighten (e.g., remove fillers like “maybe,” correct weak verbs like “is problem,” and replace vague phrases like “nothing happen” with precise consequences).

Ready to proceed? Paste your revised thesis now and tell me which paragraph you want to work on. Would you like to try revising the thesis first, or paste the thesis and the paragraph so I can give step-by-step prompts?

*Time:* 2025-11-24T13:57:53.372Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on        bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-11-24T14:06:53.746Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — let’s follow the three-step process. We must finish Step 1 (thesis) before moving on.

1) Thesis (mandatory)
- Your original thesis: "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."
- Quick feedback:
  - Strengths: clear stance (partial agreement); identifies two supporting points (influence on government; personal choices).
  - Improve: it’s wordy and hedged; remove repetition and filler; make the two supporting points more precise and preview how you will support them (e.g., “influence policy,” “shape market demand/social norms”).
- Short scaffold (fill the blanks with your own words — do not copy me exactly):
  - “I partly agree that individual actions are less powerful than governments and corporations because [how citizens influence policy], and because [how personal choices shape markets or social norms].”

Please paste your revised thesis sentence here (or confirm you’re satisfied with a version). I’ll give brief feedback and we won’t move on until you confirm it previews the two main points and uses confident, precise language.

2) Topic sentence (once thesis is confirmed)
Which paragraph would you like to work on?
- Paragraph 2 = individuals influencing government/policy
- Paragraph 3 = personal lifestyle changes affecting companies/social norms

Paste the current topic sentence for that paragraph. If you prefer, use one of these short frames to revise it (fill the blanks):
- “[Ordinary citizens/individuals] influence government policy by _______, which leads to ______.”
- “Personal lifestyle choices affect companies and social norms because _______, resulting in ______.”

Try revising the topic sentence now and paste it. I’ll check how well it links to your thesis and give one or two targeted suggestions.

3) Revising the rest of the chosen paragraph
After we agree the topic sentence, paste the full paragraph you want to revise. I will:
- Ask 2–3 focused questions about your evidence/logic.
- Point out sentences that are off-topic or vague.
- Suggest where to add a brief explanation or clearer link to the topic sentence.
(Important: I will not rewrite whole sentences or the paragraph for you.)

Ready to start? Paste your revised thesis now and tell me which paragraph/topic sentence you want to work on.

*Time:* 2025-11-24T14:08:09.092Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1  
                                                                                     bla bla bla

**You:** ok let’s revise the rest of the body paragraph #1
                                                                                                                                                                 
bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-11-24T14:12:21.056Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m ready to help with body paragraph #1, but first we must finish Step 1 (the mandatory thesis check). I can’t revise a paragraph until you paste and confirm the revised thesis sentence.

Quick reminder of what the thesis must do:
- State your stance clearly (agree / disagree / partly agree).
- Preview the two supporting points you will develop (e.g., influence on policy; effect on markets/social norms).
- Use confident, precise language (no “I think,” “maybe,” or repeated hedges).

Two short scaffolds you can use to write the thesis (fill in your own words — don’t copy me exactly):
- “I partly agree that individual actions matter less than government and corporate efforts, but they remain important because [how citizens influence policy] and because [how personal choices shape markets or social norms].”
- “While governments and corporations have the greatest capacity to reduce emissions, individuals still matter because [policy influence] and because [consumer and social pressure change behaviour].”

Please paste the revised thesis sentence you want to use (or confirm you are satisfied with one you’ve already written). Once you confirm the thesis, paste the current topic sentence for body paragraph #1 (the paragraph about influencing government/politicians). Then we’ll:

- Give focused feedback on that topic sentence and a short frame to improve it.
- Move to revising the rest of paragraph #1 (I’ll ask 2–3 targeted questions and point out where to tighten or add explanation).

Would you like to paste your revised thesis now?
