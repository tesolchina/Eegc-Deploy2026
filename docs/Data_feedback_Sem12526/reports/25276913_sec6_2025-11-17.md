            ## Contribution Analysis

            It looks like you have been actively discussing your essay’s thesis and paragraph structure with the AI, but haven’t yet shared your own revised thesis or topic sentence based on that feedback. Here’s a clear plan and actionable guidance to help you complete your revision steps and move forward:

---

### 1. **Revise Your Thesis Statement**

Your current thesis (about individual actions vs. government and company roles in climate change) is a bit long and contains phrases like “I believe” that weaken its academic tone.

**Goal:** Write a concise, confident thesis that directly states your view and previews the two main points you will develop.

**Example template:**  
*“Although individual actions alone cannot solve climate change, citizens play a vital role by influencing government policies and by adopting sustainable lifestyles.”*

**Your Task:**  
Try to write your own version of this thesis, clearly showing:  
- That you recognize both the power of government and the role of individuals  
- Preview the two supporting ideas (influence on government & personal lifestyle changes)  

Please share your revised thesis here to receive feedback.

---

### 2. **Revise a Topic Sentence**

Once your thesis is clear, pick one body paragraph to revise its topic sentence so it clearly links to your thesis and previews that paragraph’s main idea.

**For example, for the paragraph about influencing government:**  
A clear topic sentence might be:  
*“One of the most effective ways individuals can combat climate change is by pressuring governments to enact stronger environmental policies.”*

**Your Task:**  
Choose the paragraph you want to revise first and try writing a clear, focused topic sentence that:  
- Summarizes the paragraph’s main point  
- Connects back to your thesis’s first or second idea  

Share your draft topic sentence here for feedback.

---

### 3. **Revise a Body Paragraph**

After your topic sentence is clear, revise the body paragraph to:  
- Improve flow and coherence (use clear transitions)  
- Eliminate awkward phrasing or grammar mistakes  
- Ensure all sentences support the topic sentence clearly  

You can share the paragraph here and I can give suggestions on wording, transitions, and phrasing.

---

### Summary

You are engaged and asking good questions! Now what’s missing is moving from discussion to action:

- **Write and share your revised thesis statement**  
- **Write and share a revised topic sentence for one paragraph**  
- Then **revise that paragraph’s content and style**  

Once you complete these steps, your essay will show clear progress with concrete revisions. Then we can assess your improvements and continue refining.

---

**Please share your revised thesis or topic sentence draft when ready!** I’m here to help you polish it and support your writing development.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-17T09:35:30.970Z

**You:** Nowadays, there is an ongoing debate about industrial development: whether technological shifts in industry will improve global employment prospects. In my opinion, such technological changes will ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long run.

We all know that industrial automation reduces jobs while increasing efficiency. Many workers face the risk of unemployment, as some roles are replaced by automated machines. For society, this helps reduce resource waste. However, for individual workers, it means losing their salaries and wages—leaving some unable to support themselves.

Older workers, in particular, often lack advanced skills and can only perform basic factory jobs. If these positions are replaced by machines or industrial automation, they may lose their ability to earn income. For a society to function effectively, simply boosting production efficiency is not enough. In my view, everyone should have access to employment to sustain their livelihoods, as this is key to a stable society.

Additionally, while we should prioritize production efficiency, we must also care for the diverse needs of individuals. This way, everyone can feel secure and fulfilled.

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s begin with **Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**.

**Please share your current thesis statement for your essay.**  
This will usually be the main claim or opinion in your introduction.

Your current thesis statement seems to be:  
“In my opinion, such technological changes will ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long run.”

Let’s work with this! Here’s my feedback:

**Strengths:**  
- Your opinion is clear.
- The statement directly addresses the essay question about employment prospects.

**Areas to Improve:**  
- It could specify how technological changes affect jobs, for extra clarity.
- Try to “preview” your main supporting points (for example: automation replaces workers; older employees are especially vulnerable).
- Use precise and confident language—your phrase “in the long run” can stay, but try to be as specific as possible.

**Questions and Suggestions:**  
- Can you show in your thesis that both efficiency and social issues will be topics?
- Try to avoid “In my opinion…” if possible; just state your view directly.

**Prompt for you:**  
Would you like to try rewriting the thesis statement now, making it more specific and previewing your main supporting points? 

You can try something like:  
“Technological advancements in industry will undermine global employment prospects because automation reduces jobs and creates additional challenges for vulnerable workers.”

But don’t copy my suggestion—please write it in your own words first!  
Let me know when you’re happy with your revised thesis, or ask for more hints if you need them.

*Time:* 2025-11-17T09:37:12.506Z

**You:** Do you think there are any aspects in the paragraph structure of my article, such as coherence and fluency, that need to be revised?

*Time:* 2025-11-17T09:45:43.640Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for your question! I’m glad you’re thinking about overall structure, coherence, and fluency—these are key for strong academic writing. Here’s some feedback about your article’s paragraph structure, based on what you’ve shared:

**Coherence:**  
- Your paragraphs each focus on a clear idea: the influence of individuals on government, and personal lifestyle choices.
- Each paragraph connects well to your main argument.

**Fluency:**  
- Most of your sentences are logically ordered, and you use words like “for example”, “on the other hand”, and “in conclusion” to guide the reader.
- Some transitions between ideas (especially when introducing limits or counterpoints) could be smoother. Sometimes, words like "But also" or "Or maybe" can make the flow a little choppy.
- Watch for sentences that switch quickly from positive to negative without much explanation—adding short connecting phrases or reasons can help the reader follow your logic better.

**Unity:**  
- Each body paragraph stays on topic, but a few sentences drift off the main idea (for example, talking generally about people not caring, without linking back to your topic sentence).
- Try to make sure every supporting sentence clearly relates back to the topic sentence and—most importantly—to your revised thesis.

**My Suggestion:**  
After you revise your thesis and your topic sentence, try reading your draft out loud to check if it “flows” naturally. This can help you catch abrupt changes or awkward transitions.

**Next Steps:**  
- Let’s finish revising your thesis.
- Then, when we work on a body paragraph, we’ll focus specifically on coherence and logical flow within that paragraph.

Would you like help identifying which transitions or sentences might break the flow? Or shall we move forward with the thesis revision first?

*Time:* 2025-11-17T09:45:50.088Z

**You:** Do you think my topic sentence is clearly stated? I feel it's not very clear.

*Time:* 2025-11-17T09:51:55.449Z

**Assistant:** Great question! Let’s focus on your topic sentence, but first, according to our revision process, **let’s finish the thesis statement revision before moving to the topic sentence.**

**1. Thesis Statement Revision**

Your draft thesis is:  
> “I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”

**Feedback:**
- You express a balanced opinion, which is good!
- The sentence is a bit long and could be clearer.
- Try to preview the two main points of your essay: 1) citizen influence on government, and 2) individual green choices.
- Avoid phrases like “I believe” and “I also think,” and state your view more directly.

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement now, making it:
- Clear and confident (no “I believe…”),
- and showing your two points (citizen influence & personal green actions)?

If you’d like a hint, here’s a possible structure to help you:
> “Although individual actions are less impactful than those of governments and corporations, citizens play a crucial role by influencing policy and modeling green lifestyles.”

**But please write it in your own words!**

Once you revise your thesis statement, share it here.  
Are you ready to try your own revision now?

**Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**

First, please share the exact thesis statement you would like to revise. For your essay on climate change and individual vs. government/company action, your current thesis looks like:

> “I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”

**My Feedback:**
- Your thesis shows a “balanced” or “qualified” viewpoint—excellent!
- It covers both main points: (1) citizens can influence government, and (2) personal lifestyle choices also matter.
- The sentence is a bit long, and relies on “I believe/I also think”—this can weaken your academic tone.
- You can preview your main points more clearly.

**Suggested Focus:**
- State your position directly, without “I believe/I think.”
- Preview both points (influence on government; personal green choices).
- Make it concise and confident.

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement now? For example, you might start with:
> “Although individual actions have less impact than those of governments and companies, citizens play a vital role in combating climate change by influencing political decisions and adopting environmentally friendly lifestyles.”

Try to put this idea into your own words—keep it clear, confident, and preview your two main ideas.

Would you like to share your revised thesis now? I’m happy to give feedback or more hints if you would like!

*(Once you’re satisfied with your thesis, we’ll move on to Step 2: revising a topic sentence in one of your body paragraphs—please tell me which paragraph you’d like to work on next!)*
