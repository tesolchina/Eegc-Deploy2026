            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your progress and goals! Here's a summary of your current status, along with detailed feedback and practical recommendations going forward.

---

### Summary of Your Revision Progress

- **Thesis statement:** Revised from a vague, hedged sentence to a clear and specific claim with a preview of reasons. This significantly improves clarity and argumentative focus.
- **First body paragraph topic sentence:** Refined to explicitly link to the thesis and introduce the paragraph’s main idea clearly.
- **First body paragraph (full):** Rewritten to improve logical flow, clarity, academic tone, grammar, and vocabulary. Cause-and-effect relationships are clearer, and the paragraph supports your thesis effectively.

Your revised thesis and first paragraph demonstrate stronger academic writing and more precise language use. These improvements lay a good foundation for revising the rest of your essay.

---

### Key Strengths Demonstrated

- Willingness to engage in a structured revision plan and follow step-by-step guidance.
- Significant lexical improvement and reduction of vague or informal expressions in revised sections.
- Enhanced logical connections in the thesis and first paragraph, helping readers understand your argument more clearly.

---

### Areas for Development and Next Steps

1. **Revise Remaining Paragraphs for Consistency**  
   The business/market paragraph, social media paragraph, and concluding advantages paragraph still contain many original grammar, vocabulary, and logic problems. Applying the same kind of revision you did for the first paragraph will strengthen your essay’s overall coherence and tone.

2. **Strengthen Logical Flow and Transitions**  
   Make sure that each paragraph links explicitly back to your thesis using clear topic sentences and transitions (words and phrases like “Furthermore,” “In addition,” “Consequently,” etc.). This will help your essay read more logically and smoothly.

3. **Add Specific Supporting Evidence**  
   Consider adding brief examples, facts, or relevant data to support your points. For instance, you could mention a policy change, a reported case of worker abuse, or credible statistics. This will increase your essay’s persuasiveness and credibility.

4. **Develop Critical Evaluation Skills**  
   When working with AI-generated suggestions or peer feedback, try to actively compare alternatives, weigh pros and cons, and explain your preferences. This practice will deepen your analytical skills and strengthen your independent editing.

5. **Practice Independent Revision**  
   Although using AI to model revisions is helpful, also try drafting your own sentences or paragraphs before asking for feedback. This will build your confidence and ownership over your writing.

---

### Suggested Plan for Continued Revision

- **Step 1:** Choose the next paragraph to revise (e.g., business/market).  
- **Step 2:** Rewrite the topic sentence so it clearly connects to your thesis and previews the paragraph’s main idea.  
- **Step 3:** Revise supporting sentences for grammar, vocabulary, logical clarity, and elaboration.  
- **Step 4:** Add transition sentences or phrases to ensure flow between paragraphs.  
- **Step 5:** Optionally, add one or two brief pieces of concrete evidence or examples.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 16/25 - The draft addresses the prompt (stricter laws for migrant workers) and mentions social, economic and media perspectives, but ideas are underdeveloped, vague, and sometimes confusing (e.g., “help their rights,” unclear causal links).
- Organization: 15/25 - There is an attempt at paragraphing by topic, but topic sentences and internal logical progression are weak; many supporting sentences stray from or fail to develop the main idea.
- Vocabulary: 14/25 - Frequent imprecise word choices and non-standard phrases (e.g., “migrant market,” “illegal voice,” “What ‘more”) limit clarity and register.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 13/25 - Numerous errors (articles, verb agreement, fragments, awkward collocations) often impede meaning (e.g., “we are living a warm and peace environment,” “they will feel greatly for the government”).
- **Original Essay Total: 58/100**

Evidence (original):
- Opening thesis: “I think governments should set stricter laws to help their rights.” — hedging, unclear object.
- Example sentence showing grammar/vocabulary problems: “For business market, it will not let them get more money because as the pay get lower, the efficiency of workers will get lower, and it might let the equality of product become worse!”

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The new thesis explicitly states the claim and previews reasons: “Governments should enforce stricter labor laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because stronger regulation promotes social stability, ensures fair wages and decent working conditions that sustain economic productivity, and reduces social tensions when abuses are publicized.” This gives a clearer argumentative framework. The revised first body paragraph develops the social-stability reason coherently.
- Organization: 20/25 - Structure improves because the thesis now previews three reasons and the first paragraph has a clear topic sentence that links to the thesis: “Stricter labor laws promote social stability by protecting migrant workers from abuse and reducing resentment that can lead to social unrest.” However, other paragraphs remain unrewritten and thus the essay’s overall logical progression is still uneven.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - The revised thesis and first paragraph show more precise academic vocabulary (“decent working conditions,” “alienated,” “public safety”). Remaining paragraphs still contain imprecise phrases and informal language that limit the essay’s overall lexical strength.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 17/25 - The revised paragraph demonstrates clearer, grammatically correct sentences (e.g., “When migrant workers face unpaid wages, excessively long hours, or unsafe conditions, they can lose trust in institutions and become alienated…”). However, several other paragraphs in the revised essay are unchanged and retain frequent errors, so grammar accuracy is mixed.
- **Revised Essay Total: 76/100**

Evidence (revised):
- Revised thesis (quoted): “Governments should enforce stricter labor laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because stronger regulation promotes social stability, ensures fair wages and decent working conditions that sustain economic productivity, and reduces social tensions when abuses are publicized.”
- Revised topic sentence (quoted): “Stricter labor laws promote social stability by protecting migrant workers from abuse and reducing resentment that can lead to social unrest.”
- Revised first body paragraph (quoted excerpt): “When migrant workers face unpaid wages, excessively long hours, or unsafe conditions, they can lose trust in institutions and become alienated from the wider community. This alienation can increase the risk of protests, informal or criminal activity, and tensions between groups, which threatens public safety.”

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +18 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Strong, specific thesis statement that previews the main reasons and removes hedging.
  - Clear, focused topic sentence for the first body paragraph that connects to the thesis.
  - Rewritten first body paragraph with improved logic, clearer cause–effect reasoning, and corrected grammar and vocabulary.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Remaining paragraphs (business/market; social media; advantages) retain many of the original grammar, vocabulary, and logical problems and need revision to match the improved first paragraph.
  - Transitions between paragraphs and explicit linkage to the thesis throughout the essay could be strengthened (use of signposting and linking phrases).
  - Provide concrete examples, data, or more specific evidence to support claims (e.g., brief statistics, illustrative cases, or references to policy examples) to raise content credibility.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 11 messages**
- **Conversation Quality:** The interaction was targeted and stepwise. The assistant presented a clear revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), the student requested specific revisions at each step, and the assistant provided concrete rewrites. The conversation focused on guided revision but showed limited instances of the student evaluating alternatives or pushing back on AI suggestions.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - The chat included multiple meaningful exchanges (11 messages) and covered multi-step revision tasks. However, it did not reach the breadth/depth of an extensive iterative conversation (no long exploration of alternatives, evidence-gathering, or extended critical discussion).
  - Evidence: assistant laid out the three-step plan at first message; the student proceeded through thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph updates in sequential prompts.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - The student mostly accepted and requested AI-produced revisions rather than critically evaluating or selectively rejecting suggestions. There is limited evidence of the student challenging or justifying choices.
  - Evidence: student repeatedly asked “Please provide me with the revised paragraph/sentence” and accepted the assistant’s outputs with no recorded critique or alternative proposals.
- **Refining Process**: 4/5 - There is a clear iterative process: the student and assistant completed the three recommended revision steps (thesis → topic sentence → body paragraph) in separate focused turns. That shows an organized refining process, though the iterations relied heavily on the assistant’s rewrites rather than student-authored alternates.
  - Evidence: timestamps/sequences show assistant suggested a thesis, then a revised topic sentence, then a revised first body paragraph; the student requested each in turn.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 9/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear willingness to follow a structured revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) and to implement targeted changes.
  - Evidence: Student successively requested a revised thesis, then topic-sentence revision, then a revised body paragraph.
- Improvement in academic register and argument focus in the revised portions.
  - Evidence: Revised thesis and first paragraph use precise phrases like “protect migrant workers’ rights,” “decent working conditions,” and “alienated from the wider community.”
- Effective use of AI to generate concrete, usable sentence- and paragraph-level revisions.
  - Evidence: Assistant provided full replacement thesis and a polished first body paragraph that the student inserted into the revised essay.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Develop independent critical evaluation of AI suggestions rather than accepting them wholesale. When the AI offers alternatives, students should weigh trade-offs and explain preferences.
  - Recommendation: Ask the AI for 2–3 alternative phrasings and state which you prefer and why.
- Revise the remaining paragraphs with the same level of care to ensure coherence, consistent tone, and grammatical accuracy across the whole essay.
  - Recommendation: Apply the patterns used in the revised first paragraph (clear topic sentence, concrete causes/effects, grammatical accuracy) to the business and social-media paragraphs.
- Add specific supporting evidence and stronger transitions to raise persuasiveness.
  - Recommendation: Include a brief concrete example, statistic, or hypothetical to illustrate claims (e.g., a policy instance or a reported abuse case), and add linking phrases between paragraphs.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the original essay and clear revision goals (“structure, vocabulary, and critical analysis”) and followed the assistant’s chosen plan.
  - Evidence: At the start the student stated challenges and accepted the three-step process.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student accepted a staged revision plan and followed it step-by-step.
  - Evidence: Chat begins with an explicit three-step revision plan; the student proceeded through each step.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student did not demonstrate strong critical assessment of AI suggestions or justify acceptance/rejection.
  - Evidence: Responses consistently requested the AI’s revisions and did not record evaluating alternative suggestions.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The student relied on AI-produced rewrites rather than producing and refining their own versions in the chat log.
  - Evidence: The AI provided rewritten thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph; the student accepted these with minimal visible independent edits.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Expand revision scope to rewrite the remaining paragraphs for consistency: update topic sentences, fix grammar, and align each paragraph explicitly with the thesis.
2. Practice critical evaluation: request multiple candidate revisions from the AI and explain which you choose and why; this will strengthen critical thinking and ownership.
3. Add concrete evidence or short examples to support major claims and include transitional sentences between paragraphs to improve overall coherence.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student successfully followed the module’s prescribed three-step revision workflow and used AI assistance to produce a significantly stronger thesis and first paragraph. The work shows a positive trajectory.
- However, most improvements are concentrated in the initial paragraph(s); please encourage the student to apply the same revision techniques to the rest of the essay and to practice more active critical engagement with AI-generated options to develop independent editing skills.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
I think governments should set stricter laws to help their rights.
From a social perspective, we are living a warm and peace environment and all of us want to continue. However, if the migrant workers still have unfair treatment, they will be angry about the society and the government, which might let them do some illegal things outside the law. That will definitely affect the safety of our living environment.
For business market, it will not let them get more money because as the pay get lower, the efficiency of workers will get lower, and it might let the equality of product become worse! Without strict laws to maintain the price of business market and to protect the right of migrant workers, the migrant market will get lower and lower income and less workers want to come.
From the perspectives of people and social media, the unfair pay and treatment are illegal. If the government still do nothing to stop, it will become worse on social media because many people have a mind to follow the most. It will cause big risk of society and country.
However, it has many advantages if the government strict laws. Firstly, it will protect the right of migrant workers to let them work harder but still in a lower price than native-born populations. It can cause high profit for business market without illegal voice, because most of the people will think it was fair. Secondly, migrant workers will feel greatly for the government, so that can continue the peace and safety of society. What ‘more, social media will make the thing bigger and widely to know, it can promote the member of government followers.
That's all what I want to say.

Revised:
Governments should enforce stricter labor laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because stronger regulation promotes social stability, ensures fair wages and decent working conditions that sustain economic productivity, and reduces social tensions when abuses are publicized.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:58:50.850Z

**You:** I think governments should set stricter laws to help their rights.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:59:36.280Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for sharing your draft and your goals. Before we begin revising, let’s negotiate clear targets and diagnose the essay so we know what to work on.

1) Quick check-in on your goals
- You said your goals are to improve academic writing, and your main challenges are structure, vocabulary, and critical analysis. Is there anything else you want to add or emphasize for today? For example: clarity of argument, stronger thesis, paragraph unity, grammar? 

2) Short diagnostic feedback (using the rubric categories)
Strengths
- Topic and relevance: You address the prompt clearly — you support stricter laws for migrant workers and you consider social, economic, and media perspectives.
- Organisation attempt: You already use separate paragraphs for different perspectives, which is good structure to build on.
- Engagement: You try to explain consequences and benefits, which can become effective analysis with some tightening.

Areas to improve (mapped to the rubric)
- Thesis & Argument (Content and Ideas): The thesis (“I think governments should set stricter laws to help their rights.”) is vague, hedged, and does not preview the main points. Rating: Developing (needs a clearer, stronger position and a preview of points).
- Organisation and Logical Progression: Paragraphs are identifiable but topic sentences and supporting sentences are often unclear or off-topic, so the logical flow is weak. Rating: Developing.
- Vocabulary: Word choice is often imprecise or repetitive (e.g., “migrant market,” “get lower and lower income,” “illegal voice”). More precise academic vocabulary will help. Rating: Basic to Developing.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: Frequent errors (articles, verb forms, sentence fragments, word order) reduce clarity. Rating: Basic.

Specific examples to help you see the issues
- Thesis hedging: “I think…” — remove hedging and be direct. Also “help their rights” is unclear; say “protect migrant workers’ rights.”
- Topic sentence (paragraph 1): “From a social perspective, we are living a warm and peace environment and all of us want to continue.” — awkward grammar and doesn’t clearly connect to stricter laws.
- Supporting detail clarity: “it will not let them get more money because as the pay get lower, the efficiency of workers will get lower” — unclear cause/effect and grammar issues.
- Word choice and form problems: “What ‘more,” “migrant market,” “illegal voice,” “they will feel greatly for the government” — need clearer, standard phrasing.

3) Choose revision priorities
Here are suggested priorities based on your goals and the diagnosis:
A. Strengthen the thesis so it answers the question clearly and previews main points.
B. Improve one body paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences) so it connects to the new thesis and becomes clearer and more logical.
C. Fix key grammar and vocabulary problems in that paragraph.

Which two (or one) of these would you like to focus on today? Tell me which priorities you choose. Once you confirm, we’ll start Step 1: thesis revision.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:59:56.034Z

**You:** OK. Now let's modify the "thesis statement" part of my paper. Just give me the revised sentence.

**You:** Regarding the statement part of my thesis, what do you think should be changed? Please provide me with the revised paragraph/sentence.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:01:15.465Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a good place to focus. Before I revise, do you want me to focus only on the thesis right now? (I can update the full essay with the new thesis and then we can move to a paragraph of your choice.)

Feedback on your current thesis
- Problem: “I think…” hedges (remove it). “help their rights” is unclear and informal.
- Need: a clear, confident claim that answers the question and previews the main reasons you will discuss.
- Aim: state who should do what (governments should enforce stricter laws), why (3 clear reasons), and use precise language (e.g., “protect migrant workers’ rights,” “fair wages,” “decent working conditions,” “social stability”).

Suggested revised thesis sentence
Governments should enforce stricter labor laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because stronger regulation promotes social stability, ensures fair wages and decent working conditions that sustain economic productivity, and reduces social tensions when abuses are publicized.

Here is your full essay with that thesis replacing the original first line (no other paragraphs changed):

What ‘more, social media will make the thing bigger and widely to know, it can promote the member of government followers.
That's all what I want to say.

Are you happy with this thesis sentence? If yes, which body paragraph would you like to revise next (pick one paragraph), and do you want to focus on topic sentence, grammar, vocabulary, or logic for that paragraph?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:01:34.575Z

**You:** Regarding the "topic sentences" section of mine, what do you think should be changed? Please provide me with the revised paragraph/sentence.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:02:12.255Z

**Assistant:** Nice — thanks for that clear question. Before I give a specific example, quick confirmation: do you want to focus on improving topic sentences (connection to your thesis) for one paragraph right now? If yes, which paragraph would you like to work on — the social perspective, the business/market paragraph, the social media paragraph, or the paragraph that lists advantages? (If you don’t choose, I’ll assume you mean the first body paragraph: the social perspective.)

What to change in your topic sentences (brief guidance)
- Make the sentence directly connect to the revised thesis: say how stricter laws produce the effect you describe.
- Be concise and precise: avoid vague phrases (“warm and peace environment”) and hedging.
- Show cause and effect or the main claim for that paragraph (e.g., “Stricter laws X because Y”).
- Use formal academic tone and correct grammar.

Model topic sentence (for the social-perspective paragraph)
- Stricter labor laws promote social stability by protecting migrant workers from abuse and reducing resentment that can lead to social unrest.

I’ve inserted that model topic sentence into your full essay below (I changed only the thesis earlier and now replaced the first paragraph’s topic sentence). I did not rewrite the rest of the paragraph; those supporting sentences still need grammar and clarity work, which we can do next.

Full essay with revised thesis and revised topic sentence
Governments should enforce stricter labor laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because stronger regulation promotes social stability, ensures fair wages and decent working conditions that sustain economic productivity, and reduces social tensions when abuses are publicized.
Stricter labor laws promote social stability by protecting migrant workers from abuse and reducing resentment that can lead to social unrest. However, if the migrant workers still have unfair treatment, they will be angry about the society and the government, which might let them do some illegal things outside the law. That will definitely affect the safety of our living environment.
For business market, it will not let them get more money because as the pay get lower, the efficiency of workers will get lower, and it might let the equality of product become worse! Without strict laws to maintain the price of business market and to protect the right of migrant workers, the migrant market will get lower and lower income and less workers want to come.
From the perspectives of people and social media, the unfair pay and treatment are illegal. If the government still do nothing to stop, it will become worse on social media because many people have a mind to follow the most. It will cause big risk of society and country.
However, it has many advantages if the government strict laws. Firstly, it will protect the right of migrant workers to let them work harder but still in a lower price than native-born populations. It can cause high profit for business market without illegal voice, because most of the people will think it was fair. Secondly, migrant workers will feel greatly for the government, so that can continue the peace and safety of society. What ‘more, social media will make the thing bigger and widely to know, it can promote the member of government followers.
That's all what I want to say.

Would you like to try revising the supporting sentences in that first paragraph now (I can prompt you with guided edits), or would you prefer that I give targeted sentence-level corrections for grammar and clarity for that paragraph?

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for asking. You asked me to modify the body-paragraph section and provide a revised paragraph/sentence. I’ve revised the first body paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences) to connect clearly to the thesis and to improve clarity, logic, grammar, and vocabulary. I left the other paragraphs unchanged (we’re staying within scope).

Full essay with the revised thesis and revised first body paragraph:

Governments should enforce stricter labor laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because stronger regulation promotes social stability, ensures fair wages and decent working conditions that sustain economic productivity, and reduces social tensions when abuses are publicized.
Stricter labor laws promote social stability by protecting migrant workers from abuse and reducing resentment that can lead to social unrest. When migrant workers face unpaid wages, excessively long hours, or unsafe conditions, they can lose trust in institutions and become alienated from the wider community. This alienation can increase the risk of protests, informal or criminal activity, and tensions between groups, which threatens public safety. By enforcing fair treatment and providing clear legal channels for complaints, governments can prevent these outcomes and help maintain a peaceful society.
For business market, it will not let them get more money because as the pay get lower, the efficiency of workers will get lower, and it might let the equality of product become worse! Without strict laws to maintain the price of business market and to protect the right of migrant workers, the migrant market will get lower and lower income and less workers want to come.
From the perspectives of people and social media, the unfair pay and treatment are illegal. If the government still do nothing to stop, it will become worse on social media because many people have a mind to follow the most. It will cause big risk of society and country.
However, it has many advantages if the government strict laws. Firstly, it will protect the right of migrant workers to let them work harder but still in a lower price than native-born populations. It can cause high profit for business market without illegal voice, because most of the people will think it was fair. Secondly, migrant workers will feel greatly for the government, so that can continue the peace and safety of society. What ‘more, social media will make the thing bigger and widely to know, it can promote the member of government followers.
That's all what I want to say.

Would you like to:
- Try revising the next sentence yourself now (I’ll prompt you), or
- Have me suggest targeted edits for the second paragraph (business/market) for grammar and clarity?

If you want more edits, tell me which paragraph to work on next and whether to focus on grammar, vocabulary, or logical development.
