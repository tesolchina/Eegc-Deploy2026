        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:44:46.385Z

**You:** One major point is the way of government and citizens communicate is impactful. If the government does not care much about the demand of people, the climate crisis will continue to grow. If the government care about the environment, it’s will have a better environment law to protect our world. People just need a system that can communicate with government, I think it will go a long way.
Another point is individual also play a main role, just a small action can change a lot. If no one do green things to make it better, just the government consider it, the climate crisis will not stop.

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement:

> "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

**Here’s my feedback:**

- **Clarity:** Your position (partly agree) is clear, which is great. However, the sentence is a bit long and could be made more precise.  
- **Strength:** “I partly agree…” is fine, but you can use even more assertive, academic language. Try not to use first-person (“I”) in formal essays.  
- **Focus:** You mention two key points: (1) citizens’ influence on government and (2) individual lifestyle choices. It would be stronger if you clearly listed those as your two main points, and made clear which you think is most significant.

**To meet the assignment—your thesis should:**
- Clearly state your viewpoint (e.g., agreeing/disagreeing/partly agreeing, or which side has more importance)
- Preview the structure (your two main reasons)
- Use confident, academic language without “I think,” “I believe,” or “maybe.”

**Here are some guiding questions to help you revise:**
- Can you start directly with your viewpoint, without “I partly agree…”?  
- Could you state which action (influencing governments vs. personal choices) is more important, and why?  
- Can you briefly name your main supporting points in one sentence?

**Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now, using more academic language and specifying your main points?  
Type your revised thesis and I’ll give feedback!**
