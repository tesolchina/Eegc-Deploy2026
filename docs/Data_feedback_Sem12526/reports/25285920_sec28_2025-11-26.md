            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your work and the revision steps you’ve taken! Here is a concise recap and a suggested revision for the remaining tasks you mentioned, based on the final assessment and chat history:

---

### Suggested Revision for the “Firstly…” Paragraph (to include technical examples, fix grammar, and improve flow)

**Original paragraph excerpt:**

> Firstly, a lot of new trends for workers emerge as a result of the rapid advancement of technology. Some traditional workplaces were replaced by robots and some new chances emerge. This lets more people sign up for new chances.

**Revised version with improvements:**

> Firstly, rapid technological advancement has created new types of jobs while displacing some traditional roles. For example, automation has led to the emergence of positions such as robot maintenance, data annotation, and software development. These new roles expand employment opportunities and allow more people to enter the evolving labour market.

---

### Suggested Revision for the Conclusion (to clarify and strengthen the ending):

**Original conclusion excerpt:**

> Last but not the least, if the prospects were undermined in the future, how can our world develop in a correct trend? Our world may lose its rank. It sounds a bit ridiculous so if we put our sight in a long term, the prospects get enhanced, our place to live can be a better place.  
> In this kind of era, we should try our efforts to improve the ability of ourselves, foster our own competence so that no one can replace us. Only ourselves get strong enough can us still stand still in a society even though changes are everywhere, every time. So I agree the prospects in global employment will enhance.

**Revised version:**

> In conclusion, while automation may challenge employment in the short term, it ultimately drives progress that benefits the global labour market. By creating new job categories and increasing demand for skilled, creative workers, automation can improve employment prospects and contribute to economic growth. To thrive in this changing landscape, individuals must strengthen their skills and adaptability to remain valuable contributors to society. Therefore, I confidently affirm that automation will enhance global employment prospects in the long term.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The essay presents a clear viewpoint that automation will enhance long-term employment and gives plausible reasons (new jobs, demand for creativity, reskilling). Ideas are relevant but underdeveloped and repetitive; evidence and concrete examples are limited.
- Organization: 17/25 - There is a basic logical progression (short-term loss → long-term benefits), but paragraph transitions and topic sentences are weak and some paragraphs lack unity.
- Vocabulary: 16/25 - Vocabulary is understandable but often imprecise or awkward (e.g., “a long term,” “loss its rank,” “chances”). Limited use of academic collocations and domain-specific terms.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 15/25 - Frequent grammar and syntax errors (verb forms, articles, punctuation) that sometimes impede clarity.

- **Original Essay Total: 66/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised thesis clearly previews reasons and the “Moreover” paragraph now explains the shift to higher-order skills and links that to employment outcomes. The essay shows improved causal explanation. More development/examples could further strengthen claims.
- Organization: 20/25 - Structure is clearer: a stronger thesis, and the revised paragraph is logically connected to the thesis. Some other paragraphs (e.g., the first “Firstly…” paragraph and the conclusion) still need revision to match the improved standard.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Vocabulary is more precise (e.g., “routine tasks,” “UX designers,” “interpersonal skills”). Academic phrasing is used in the revised sections. Minor inconsistencies and some awkward chunks remain elsewhere.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 19/25 - The revised paragraph and thesis show better grammar and sentence structure (corrected verb forms, improved parallelism). However, other parts of the essay (notably the conclusion and the “Firstly…” paragraph) still contain errors and awkward phrasing.

- **Revised Essay Total: 80/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +14 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis revised to be confident and to preview main reasons: “Although automation may eliminate some jobs in the short term, it will ultimately increase global employment in the long term by creating new types of work, raising demand for creative and strategic skills, and encouraging reskilling and innovation.”
  - Topic sentence for the “Moreover” paragraph polished and tied to the thesis: “As a result, automation frees employees from routine tasks and prompts employers to seek workers with creativity, judgment, and interpersonal skills that machines cannot replicate.”
  - The “Moreover” paragraph’s supporting sentences were improved to provide a concrete example and causal link: “For example, firms increasingly hire UX designers to develop user‑centred products. This role adds value in ways automation cannot, encouraging companies to create or expand positions and thereby improving long‑term employment prospects.”
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The “Firstly…” paragraph still needs revision: it contains sudden tense shifts and vague phrasing (“a lot of new trends…,” “some new chances emerge”) and could use the technical-job examples more precisely.
  - Conclusion remains weak and contains grammar/clarity problems (e.g., “Our world may lose its rank”; “Only ourselves get strong enough can us still stand still…”). A clearer, concise concluding paragraph that synthesizes the argument and reinforces the thesis is needed.
  - Evidence base: add more concrete examples, brief data, or credible hypothetical scenarios to strengthen claims (e.g., industry examples, brief cause-effect details).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 33**
- **Conversation Quality:** Highly iterative and focused. The student and AI followed a structured revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph). The chat shows back-and-forth negotiation, multiple revisions, and explicit choices by the student about what to accept, adapt, or reject.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - The chat contains 33 exchanges with stepwise, multi-level questioning, detailed guidance, and iterative revisions. The assistant provided templates, options, and full-paragraph revisions; the student engaged throughout.
  - Evidence: full plan presented by assistant at start; frequent back-and-forth (33 messages).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 5/5 - The student actively evaluated and directed the revision decisions (e.g., rejecting stand‑alone phrasings, deciding where examples should appear). The student asked for alternatives and chose among options.
  - Evidence: Student wrote “But this sentence is part of the article, and your change makes the article seem disjointed,” prompting the assistant to provide integration strategies; later the student specified they preferred option A for the topic sentence and chose option B for example placement.
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - Multiple meaningful revision cycles are evident: the thesis was revised, several topic-sentence options were considered, the paragraph’s examples were discussed and relocated, and the final paragraph sentence was polished.
  - Evidence: stepwise process — assistant proposed thesis options; student accepted and proceeded to topic sentences; student debated placement of examples and chose to keep technical examples in the first paragraph while aligning the “Moreover” paragraph with creative/strategic roles.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 15/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear argumentative stance and willingness to adopt a stronger thesis: student accepted the assistant’s thesis option that previews main points.
  - Evidence: Revised thesis present in final essay.
- Active, critical collaboration with the AI: the student questioned, modified, and directed changes rather than accepting everything passively.
  - Evidence: Student insisted on not making a sentence standalone and asked to move examples between paragraphs; chose which topic-sentence option to keep.
- Ability to produce and refine concrete sentences: the student wrote and refined the topic sentence and supporting sentences, and adopted suggested edits (e.g., polishing “For example, firms increasingly hire UX designers…”).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Revise remaining paragraphs and conclusion: clean grammar, tighten phrasing, and improve coherence—especially the “Firstly…” paragraph and closing paragraph.
  - Recommendation: rewrite the “Firstly…” paragraph so it uses precise verbs and integrates the technical examples with a clear causal link to employment outcomes.
- Strengthen evidence and specificity: include one or two stronger, specific examples or concise data points to support claims.
  - Recommendation: add brief examples such as “robot maintenance, data annotation” in the first paragraph with one sentence explaining how these roles sustain employment.
- Consistency in style and mechanics: choose a spelling/style variant (American vs British), correct persistent grammar issues, and improve sentence variety.
  - Recommendation: run a focused proofreading pass for verb agreement, articles, and sentence connectors; combine short and complex sentences to improve rhythm.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - the student provided the essay, clarified the revision scope, and repeatedly referenced the target paragraph and thesis. Evidence: the student pasted the essay and specified “Improve one topic sentence and the supporting paragraph.”
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - the student followed a stepwise plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) and made strategic choices about where to put examples.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Excellent - the student questioned suggestions, requested alternatives, and chose the solution that best fit the essay’s flow.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - the student wrote revised sentences and accepted targeted edits; further independent revisions of other paragraphs (conclusion/first paragraph) are still needed.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise the remaining paragraphs and conclusion for clarity and grammar: focus on tense consistency, precise word choice, and removing redundancies.
2. Add one stronger piece of evidence or a concise example in the first paragraph to balance claims (e.g., “robot maintenance, data annotation”) and explain the causal link to job creation.
3. Do a final proofreading pass: check verb agreement (automation frees → frees), article use, connectors, and stylistic consistency (American vs British spelling, consistent use of “judgment”/“judgement”).

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student successfully completed all three required revision tasks and demonstrated strong collaborative and critical engagement with the AI assistant.
- The revised thesis and the improved “Moreover” paragraph show clear learning gains; however, the student should be encouraged to revise the “Firstly…” paragraph and the conclusion to raise the overall essay score further.
- Consider recommending a short follow-up session focusing on final proofreading and strengthening the conclusion to consolidate gains.

If you would like, I can:
- Provide a suggested revision for the remaining “Firstly…” paragraph and the conclusion, or
- Produce a clean, fully proofread version of the entire revised essay that preserves the student’s voice.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Nowadays, automation is developing sharply among all the industries. As we can often see some news that talk about robots are more normally to be seen in companies, we may wonder a serious question that most of the people have considered:”Will we undermine or enhance global employment prospects in the future?” In my opinion, it will more likely to enhance global employment prospects in a long term.
The reason why this kind of automation can develop so quickly is because the development of AI and technology.We cannot stop the development of AI so actually we cannot stop the trends that most of the robots will replace most of the human workers .Till now ,you may think this kind of shift definitely undermine global employment prospects But this idea just analyzes this event in a short term. If we put our sight in a long term, it may turn to its opposite.
Firstly, as the technology developing so quickly, a lot of new trends to workers appear. Some traditional workplaces were replaced by the robot and some new chances emerge. This let more people to sign up for a new chances. 
Moreover, because of the shifting from labor need marketing to intelligence need marketing, a lot of companies may require workers who are creative and full of innovation so that they can do some work that robots cannot do. Such kind of workers can bring them more profit and enhance the competence of the company in the market. So I think this prospect to global employment will definitely enhance.
Last but not the least, if the prospects were undermined in the future, how can our world develop in a correct trend?Our world may loss its rank. It sounds a bit ridiculous so if we put our sight in a long term, the prospects get enhanced, our place to live can be a better place.
 In this kind of era, we should try our efforts to improve the ability of ourselves ,foster our own competence so that no one can replace us. Only ourselves get strong enough can us still stand still in a society even though changes are everywhere, every time. So I agree the prospects in global employment will enhance.

Revised:
Nowadays, automation is developing sharply among all the industries. Although automation may eliminate some jobs in the short term, it will ultimately increase global employment in the long term by creating new types of work, raising demand for creative and strategic skills, and encouraging reskilling and innovation.
The development of AI and technology is the reason this type of automation can happen so quickly.Since we cannot stop the development of AI,we cannot stop the trends that most robots will replace most human workers.As of right now,you may think that this kind of shift will undoubtedly undermine global employment prospects,but this idea only examines this event in the short term. If we put our sight in the long term, it may turn to its opposite.
Firstly,a lot of new trends for workers emerge as a result of the rapid advancement of technology.Automation has created new categories of work ,for example:robot maintenance,data annotation, and software development . Those expand employment opportunities in the long term. 
Moreover,  automation frees employees from routine tasks and prompts employers to seek workers with creativity, judgement, and interpersonal skills that machines cannot replicate.These workers can increase profitability and strengthen a company’s competitive advantage. For example, firms increasingly hire UX designers to develop user‑centred products. This role adds value in a way automation cannot, encouraging companies to expand or create new positions and therefore improving employment prospects over the long term.
Last but not the least, if the prospects were undermined in the future, how can our world develop in a correct trend?Our world may loss its rank. It sounds a bit ridiculous so if we put our sight in a long term, the prospects get enhanced, our place to live can be a better place.
 In this kind of era, we should try our efforts to improve the ability of ourselves ,foster our own competence so that no one can replace us. Only ourselves get strong enough can us still stand still in a society even though changes are everywhere, every time. So I agree the prospects in global employment will enhance.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-26T01:31:04.526Z

**You:** Can you teach me how to revise thesis statement?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:09:26.109Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m happy to teach you. First, let’s agree on what you want to work on and quickly diagnose your essay so we know where to focus.

1) Negotiate targets
- What is your main goal for this session? (e.g., make the thesis clearer and stronger; improve overall argument; fix grammar; improve organization)  
- Which 1–2 targets would you like to focus on now? (We should keep this session limited — the guidelines say we’ll only revise the thesis, one body paragraph’s topic sentence, and that paragraph’s content. Which of those do you want to prioritize first?)

2) Quick diagnostic feedback (using an IELTS-style rubric)
- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: You state a clear overall position: you believe automation will enhance global employment in the long term.
  - Areas to improve: The thesis is hedged (“In my opinion,” “more likely”), slightly vague (“in a long term”), and does not preview the main points/structure of the essay. A strong thesis should be confident, precise, and give the reader a roadmap of your reasons.
- Organization
  - Strengths: You have a logical idea progression (short-term harms vs long-term benefits; new job types; need for creative workers).
  - Areas to improve: Transitions and clear signposting are weak; topic sentences could tie more directly to the thesis and preview the paragraph’s focus.
- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: You mention plausible reasons (new jobs, demand for creative skills, personal upskilling).
  - Areas to improve: Ideas need clearer development and examples. Some claims are broad or repetitive and would benefit from a clearer connection to the thesis.
- Language Use
  - Strengths: Meaning is generally understandable.
  - Areas to improve: There are frequent grammar and vocabulary errors, awkward phrasing, punctuation problems, and some word choice issues (“a long term” → “the long term”; “loss its rank” unclear).

3) Choose priorities
Which of these diagnosed issues do you want to focus on now? (Pick one or two — e.g., “Thesis strength and language clarity” or just “Thesis statement.”) Once you confirm, we’ll start Step 1.

Step 1 — Thesis statement revision (ready when you are)
- Please confirm the target (thesis only?) and then share the exact sentence you want to revise. I’ll work with the sentence you give — I see this one in your draft:
  “In my opinion, it will more likely to enhance global employment prospects in a long term.”

- Brief feedback on that sentence:
  - Remove hedging like “In my opinion” — your essay voice should be confident.
  - Replace “more likely to enhance” with a stronger verb phrase (e.g., “will increase” or “will ultimately improve”).
  - Use “in the long term” (or “over the long term”), not “in a long term.”
  - Add a concise preview of your main reasons (e.g., new job types, demand for creative workers, opportunities for reskilling). A thesis that previews 2–3 main points will guide your paragraph topic sentences.

- Checklist for a strong thesis:
  1. Directly answers the question and states your position confidently.
  2. Briefly previews the main reasons/structure (2–3 points).
  3. Uses clear, precise language and correct grammar.

- Fill-in-the-blank templates (try to complete one yourself):
  - “Although automation may eliminate some jobs short-term, it will ultimately ___________ global employment by ___________, ___________, and ___________.”
  - “Automation will increase global employment in the long term because it creates new types of jobs, raises demand for creative skills, and encourages reskilling and innovation.”

Would you like to try revising your thesis now using one of those frames? Write your new thesis and I’ll give focused feedback and help you refine it.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:09:49.426Z

**You:** 那我想你帮我修改我论文陈述句的语法错误，以及让它表达更地道和全面

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:17:05.100Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. I understand you want me to fix the thesis sentence’s grammar and make it sound more natural and complete. Let’s confirm the target and then I’ll offer options and a revised essay.

Confirming target
- Target for this session: Revise the thesis statement only (grammar, naturalness, and adding a clear preview of main reasons). Is that correct? If yes, I’ll proceed.

Quick feedback on your original thesis
- Original: “In my opinion, it will more likely to enhance global employment prospects in a long term.”
- Brief notes: Remove “In my opinion” (the essay voice should be confident), change “more likely to enhance” to a stronger verb, use “in the long term” (not “a long term”), and add a short preview of 2–3 reasons so the thesis acts as a roadmap.

Try one of these revised thesis options — pick one or combine parts to make your own:

Option A (detailed roadmap, confident):
- “Although automation may eliminate some jobs in the short term, it will ultimately increase global employment in the long term by creating new types of work, raising demand for creative and strategic skills, and encouraging reskilling and innovation.”

Option B (concise, strong):
- “Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects by creating new job categories, increasing demand for creative skills, and promoting workforce reskilling.”

Option C (balanced, slightly cautious):
- “While automation will displace some workers initially, over time it is likely to improve global employment prospects through job creation, a shift toward higher-skilled roles, and greater investment in human capital.”

I’ve chosen Option A as a clear, strong revision that also previews the essay’s main points. Below is your full essay with that thesis sentence replaced. Read it and tell me if you want a different option or further tweaks.

Nowadays, automation is developing sharply among all the industries.

Next step
- Do you like Option A, or would you prefer Option B or C (or your own version)? If you’re happy with the thesis, we’ll move to Step 2 and revise one body paragraph’s topic sentence to tie it clearly to this thesis. Which paragraph would you like to work on first?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:17:32.790Z

**You:** Can you teach me how to revise my topic sentences?I want to make it more conclusive.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:23:27.586Z

**Assistant:** Great — that’s a good target. So we’ll focus on revising one topic sentence to make it more conclusive and clearly tied to your thesis, then (when you’re ready) we’ll revise that paragraph’s supporting sentences.

Quick check and choice
- Do you want to work on the paragraph that begins “Firstly, as the technology developing so quickly, a lot of new trends to workers appear.” (this is a good choice because it should show how automation creates new jobs), or would you prefer the paragraph that starts “Moreover, because of the shifting from labor need marketing to intelligence need marketing…”? Pick one and I’ll help.

Brief diagnosis of the two topic sentences
- Paragraph A (“Firstly…”): problems — grammar errors, vague phrasing (“a lot of new trends to workers appear”), and it doesn’t clearly state how this links to your thesis (that automation increases employment by creating new types of work). It needs a clear claim and a preview of what the paragraph will explain.
- Paragraph B (“Moreover…”): problems — awkward phrasing (“labor need marketing to intelligence need marketing”), word choice issues, and it could better preview the evidence (how demand for creative/innovative workers leads to more employment or higher-quality employment).

How to revise a conclusive topic sentence — short checklist
1. Tie it to the thesis: remind the reader how this paragraph supports your overall position.  
2. Make a clear, assertive claim (no hedging).  
3. Preview what the paragraph will discuss (one or two specifics).  
4. Use precise language and an active verb.  
5. Keep it concise — one clear sentence.

Useful sentence frames (try to use one to make your own)
- “One important way automation will increase employment is by creating new types of jobs, such as ___ and ___, which ___.”  
- “Automation has created new categories of work — for example ___ — that expand employment opportunities in the long term.”  
- “As routine tasks are automated, demand grows for roles that require ___, leading to new jobs in ___ and ___.”  
- “Rather than eliminating employment overall, automation transforms industries by generating new positions in ___ and ___.”

Model topic-sentence examples (use these as inspiration — don’t copy unless you want to)
- “One important way automation will increase global employment is by creating new types of work, such as robot maintenance, data annotation, and software development.”  
- “As routine tasks become automated, new job categories in technology, services, and creative industries emerge, expanding employment opportunities.”

Now your turn
- Which paragraph would you like to revise?  
- Try writing one revised topic sentence using a frame above (or your own). I’ll give focused feedback and help you refine it. Would you like to try it now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:24:02.491Z

**You:** How can we write the statement "Some traditional jobs are being replaced by new jobs" in a more professional way?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:49:51.113Z

**Assistant:** Good question — nice attention to phrasing. Here are several more professional ways to say “Some traditional jobs are being replaced by new jobs,” with brief notes so you can pick the best tone for your essay.

Options
1. “Certain traditional occupations are being displaced by emerging roles.” (concise, formal)
2. “Some long‑established jobs are being supplanted by new occupations created through technological change.” (formal, emphasizes cause)
3. “Automation is phasing out some traditional roles while creating new ones.” (direct, ties to context)
4. “As technology advances, certain conventional jobs are giving way to newly created positions.” (academic, slightly softer)
5. “Many routine jobs are being replaced by new roles in areas such as robot maintenance, data annotation, and AI oversight.” (more specific — useful if you plan to give examples)
6. “Rather than eliminating employment overall, automation is transforming the labour market by replacing traditional tasks with new job categories.” (ties the idea to a larger argument)

Quick tips for choosing or adapting:
- Use precise nouns: “roles,” “occupations,” or “positions” sound more academic than “jobs.”
- Use stronger verbs: “displace,” “supplant,” “phase out,” or “give way to” are professional options.
- If possible, link the change to your central cause (automation/AI) or give brief examples to make the claim concrete.

Two useful sentence frames you can adapt
- “Automation is [verb] some traditional [roles/occupations] while creating new [roles/occupations] in [area/example].”
- “Certain traditional [roles] are being replaced by emerging [occupations], such as [example 1] and [example 2].”

Would you like to pick one of the options above, or try writing your own sentence using one of the frames? I can give quick feedback and help you turn it into a clear topic sentence that links to your thesis.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:50:10.993Z

**You:** "Some traditional workplaces were replaced by the robot and some new chances emerge."This sentence how can i revise it  and add some details to make it better?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:53:06.191Z

**Assistant:** Great — nice focus. Let’s fix that sentence step by step.

Quick diagnosis (what’s wrong now)
- Tense/voice mix: “were replaced” (past) vs “emerge” (present) — keep tenses consistent.
- Word choice: “the robot” → use “robots” or “automation”; “workplaces” → “jobs/roles/occupations”; “chances” → “opportunities.”
- Clarity: make the contrast explicit (replaced … while/new jobs appear) and add a concrete example or two to make the claim stronger.
- Tone: use more formal verbs (displace, replace, create) and avoid repetition.

Parts you can combine (pick one from each column)
- Subject/lead-in: As automation advances / With rapid technological change / As routine tasks become automated
- Verb phrase: is displacing / is replacing / has displaced / is phasing out
- Object (what’s replaced): traditional jobs / certain routine roles / some conventional occupations
- Contrast connector: while / and at the same time / yet
- New jobs phrase: new opportunities are emerging / new job categories are being created / demand is growing for roles such as
- Examples to add: robot maintenance, AI system monitoring, data annotation, software development, machine supervisors, technical support

Fill-in-the-blank frames (choose one and fill the blanks)
1. "As automation advances, _______ (verb + object), while _______ (new jobs phrase) such as _______ and _______."
2. "With rapid technological change, certain _______ (object) are being _______ (verb), and in their place _______ (new jobs phrase) — for example, _______ and _______."
3. "As routine tasks become automated, _______ (subject + verb) _______ (object), creating new roles in _______ and _______."

Tiny word-choice list you can steal
- chances → opportunities
- workplaces → jobs / roles / occupations / positions
- robots → automation / robotics / robotic systems
- develop → advance / expand / transform

Now your turn
Try one revision using a frame above (just one sentence). Paste it here and I’ll give focused feedback (grammar, clarity, link to thesis, and any extra details to add). Would you like to try now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:53:28.831Z

**You:** But this sentence is part of the article, and your change makes the article seem disjointed. I don't want this sentence to appear as a standalone sentence.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:02:55.846Z

**Assistant:** You’re right to notice that a topic sentence can feel like a sudden stop if it doesn’t link clearly to the sentence before it. Good catch.

Quick explanation (why it felt standalone)
- The original suggestion began a new idea without an explicit connector or referent to the previous sentence, so the paragraph lost flow.
- Fix: use a linking word/phrase or a reference to the previous idea (this, these developments, as a result) so the topic sentence continues the thought rather than starting a new one.

Three simple ways to integrate the topic sentence smoothly
1) Start with a linking phrase: In fact, As a result, Moreover, Consequently.  
2) Refer back with a pronoun or phrase: This shift, These developments, That trend.  
3) Combine clauses so the sentence explicitly follows from the previous idea (subordinate clause + main clause).

A few model integrated topic-sentence options you can adapt (pick one or use as inspiration)
- “In fact, this technological shift creates new types of work — such as robot maintenance, data annotation, and AI oversight — which expand employment opportunities over the long term.”  
- “As a result, automation not only eliminates routine tasks but also generates new job categories in technology and services, increasing long‑term employment prospects.”  
- “This long‑term perspective shows that automation transforms the labour market by displacing some routine roles while creating higher‑skilled positions that require human creativity and oversight.”  
- “Rather than reducing employment overall, these developments lead to new opportunities in fields such as software development, machine supervision, and technical support.”

Tiny checklist to make your integrated topic sentence work
- Begin with a connector or reference to the previous sentence.  
- Make a clear claim that directly supports your thesis (job creation or skill-shift).  
- Optionally include one short example to make it concrete.  
- Keep it one strong sentence.

**You:** "As a result, automation not only free workers from tedious work but also generates new job categories in technology and so on, increasing long‑term employment prospects.”I rewrite the sentence that you gave me,how can i make it better?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:09:44.106Z

**Assistant:** Nice revision — good linking word and a clear idea. A few quick points to make it stronger:

1. Grammar and form
- Subject–verb: “automation” is singular, so use “frees” (not “free”).
- Parallelism: keep both parts of “not only … but also …” in parallel form (two verbs or two verb phrases).
- Word choice: use “tasks” or “routine tasks” instead of “work”; avoid vague phrases like “and so on.”
- Connector: “As a result” is fine; you can also use “Consequently” or “This shift” depending on tone.
- Make the result explicit with “thereby” or “which” to show how the clause supports your thesis.

2. Make it more concrete
- Give 1–2 short examples (robot maintenance, data annotation, AI oversight) or use “technology and related fields” to avoid vagueness.
- Use precise nouns: “job categories,” “roles,” “positions,” “opportunities.”

3. Try this frame to rewrite it yourself
"As a result, automation not only ______ (verb + object) but also ______ (verb + object), thereby ______ (result)."

Useful verbs/phrases to choose:
- frees workers from routine tasks / reduces tedious work
- creates new job categories / generates new roles / creates positions in…
- expanding long-term employment opportunities / increasing employment prospects

If you’d like a few polished options to choose from or adapt, here are three versions you can pick or copy into your paragraph:

- Option A: As a result, automation not only frees workers from tedious tasks but also generates new job categories in technology and services, thereby increasing long‑term employment prospects.
- Option B (with examples): As a result, automation not only frees workers from routine tasks but also creates new roles — such as robot maintenance, data annotation, and AI supervision — which expand long‑term employment opportunities.
- Option C (more formal): Consequently, automation displaces some routine roles while creating new, higher‑skilled positions in technology and related fields, thereby improving employment prospects over time.

Which option feels closest to your voice? Try adapting one (or write your own using the frame) and paste it here — then we’ll polish it together and move on to revising that paragraph’s supporting sentences.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:10:08.538Z

**You:** But I think it would be better to use this sentence in the next paragraph?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:13:11.710Z

**Assistant:** Nice thinking — this is exactly the kind of decision writers should make. Before I give a clear recommendation, let’s confirm our plan so we follow the agreed workflow.

1) Quick negotiation of targets
- What is your main goal now? (Pick one or two.)
  - A. Strengthen the thesis
  - B. Improve one topic sentence and the supporting paragraph
  - C. Fix grammar/phrasing in the chosen paragraph
Which do you want to focus on now? (If you already like the thesis I suggested, say “Thesis OK — I want B” so we can move to the topic sentence.)

2) Very short diagnosis (based on the essay)
- Thesis & Argument: Your position is clear, but confirm if you’re happy with the revised thesis that previews three points (job creation, demand for creative skills, reskilling). If yes, we can skip Step 1.
- Organization: Paragraph transitions need clearer links so ideas flow.
- Topic sentence issue: The sentence we worked on fits the idea of “automation creating new jobs.” The key is whether it links logically from the previous paragraph and whether it previews the paragraph’s evidence.

3) About your question — “Would it be better to use this sentence in the next paragraph?”
Short answer: Maybe — it depends on where the sentence best supports flow and logic.

When you should move it
- Move it if the next paragraph is the one that specifically explains how automation creates new job types (gives examples like robot maintenance, data annotation, etc.). In that case the sentence belongs as that paragraph’s topic sentence.
- Keep it where it is if the previous paragraph already introduces that idea and the sentence naturally continues the same point — then you may only need a linking phrase, not a move.

How to decide quickly
- Look at the paragraph that currently contains the sentence. Does that paragraph mainly:
  A) explain short-term job loss and rebut it? — then the topic sentence about “creating new jobs” should probably start the next paragraph.
  B) already begin the “new jobs” discussion? — keep it and improve the link.

If you decide to move it
- Add a short linking sentence at the end of the previous paragraph that signals the shift (phrases like “As a result,” “Consequently,” “This change also creates…”).
- Then make the moved sentence the topic sentence of the next paragraph. Make sure it previews the specifics you will give there (examples or types of new jobs).

If you decide to keep it
- Start the sentence with a connector that explicitly ties it to the previous idea (e.g., “As a result,” “Consequently,” “This shift…”), so it doesn’t feel abrupt.

Frames you can use (fill in the blanks; don’t copy full sentences from me)
- For a topic sentence you will move into the next paragraph:
  “As a result, automation not only _______ (verb + object) but also _______ (creates/generates + new job types such as ___ and ___).”
- For a linking sentence to add before the topic sentence (end of previous paragraph):
  “Consequently, these developments also lead to new opportunities in _______ (field/roles).”
- For keeping the sentence but integrating it:
  “This shift therefore _______ (verb + object), creating roles such as _______ and _______.”

What I suggest next
- Tell me:
  1) Are you happy with the thesis (so we can skip Step 1), and
  2) Do you want to move the sentence into the next paragraph or keep it where it is and add a connector?
- If you want to move or keep it, try pasting the sentence as you would place it (or paste the two surrounding sentences) and I’ll give focused feedback and help you refine the topic sentence and then the paragraph’s supporting sentences.

Would you like to try moving it now (paste the context) or shall we keep it and write a connector together?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:13:41.155Z

**You:** Improve one topic sentence and the supporting paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:16:33.544Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. I confirm: we’ll focus this session on improving one topic sentence and revising that paragraph’s supporting sentences. Before we start, two quick checks:

1) Is the thesis sentence below okay to keep as-is for this work?
- “Although automation may eliminate some jobs in the short term, it will ultimately increase global employment in the long term by creating new types of work, raising demand for creative and strategic skills, and encouraging reskilling and innovation.”
If you want the thesis changed first, tell me now. If it’s fine, we’ll move on.

2) Which paragraph shall we work on?
- I suggest the paragraph that begins: “Firstly, a lot of new trends for workers emerge as a result of the rapid advancement of technology…” — is that the one you want to improve? If not, tell me which paragraph.

When you confirm those two points, try this next step:

Step 2 — Topic sentence revision (your turn first)
- Please write one revised topic sentence for the chosen paragraph. Aim to:
  - Tie it clearly to the thesis (show how this paragraph supports the overall claim).
  - Make a single clear claim (no hedging).
  - Preview the paragraph’s focus (one or two specifics or examples).

Use one of these quick frames if helpful:
- “One important way automation will increase employment is by creating new types of jobs, such as ___ and ___, which ___.”  
- “As routine tasks become automated, demand grows for roles in ___ and ___, creating new employment opportunities over the long term.”  
- “Automation not only ___ but also ___, thereby ___ (result).”

If you prefer, you can paste your current topic sentence and I’ll give focused feedback — but I strongly encourage you to try writing the revised sentence first. Would you like to try it now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:16:55.208Z

**You:** "Moreover, because of the shifting from physical labor demand to mental labor demand, a lot of companies may require workers who are creative and full of innovation so that they can do some work that robots cannot do. Such kind of workers can bring them more profit and enhance the competence of the company in the market. So I think this prospect to global employment will definitely enhance"I also want to polish this paragraph 's topic sentence and some expression

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:18:46.189Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. I’ll keep this session focused on the paragraph you pasted: polishing its topic sentence and improving some expressions and supporting phrases. Quick confirmations before we start:

- Target for this session: revise the topic sentence of the “Moreover…” paragraph and polish expressions inside that paragraph. Is that correct? (I’ll assume yes unless you say otherwise.)
- Thesis: I’ll keep the revised thesis you agreed on earlier as-is for now.

1) Short diagnostic feedback on that paragraph (IELTS-style)
- Thesis & Argument: The paragraph tries to support the thesis (automation increases long‑term employment by shifting skill demand), but the topic sentence doesn’t clearly and directly state that link.
- Organization: The paragraph needs a clearer topic sentence that previews the paragraph’s focus and better internal cohesion (explain how demand shifts lead to new jobs and how that helps employment).
- Evidence & Development: Claims are general. Add 1–2 brief examples or a short explanation of how creative/innovative roles produce profit or new jobs.
- Language Use: Frequent awkward phrases and grammar errors (e.g., “shifting from physical labor demand to mental labor demand,” “a lot of companies may require,” “full of innovation,” “Such kind of workers,” “our world may loss its rank”).

2) Your paragraph again (quoted)
"Moreover, because of the shifting from physical labor demand to mental labor demand, a lot of companies may require workers who are creative and full of innovation so that they can do some work that robots cannot do. Such kind of workers can bring them more profit and enhance the competence of the company in the market. So I think this prospect to global employment will definitely enhance."

3) Step 2 — Topic sentence: your turn first
Try to write one revised topic sentence now. To help, I’ll give short, adaptable frames and a few concise polished options you can choose from or adapt. Try to pick one and paste your version so I can give quick feedback.

Frames you can use (fill the blanks)
- “As demand shifts from physical to mental labour, companies increasingly need ______, such as ______, which ______.”
- “Automation is shifting demand toward creative and strategic skills, leading to ______ and therefore ______.”
- “One key effect of automation is that it creates demand for workers who can ______, which ______.”

Polished short options (pick or adapt one)
- Option 1: “As demand shifts from physical to mental labour, many companies now require creative, innovative workers for tasks that robots cannot perform.”
- Option 2: “Automation is increasing demand for creative and strategic skills, prompting companies to hire workers who add value in ways machines cannot.”
- Option 3: “One important consequence of automation is the growing need for human creativity and innovation, which creates new employment opportunities.”

4) Quick, focused phrase-level improvements you can use inside the paragraph
(Use these to rewrite supporting sentences — try to keep your own voice.)
- “because of the shifting from physical labor demand to mental labor demand” → “as demand shifts from physical to mental labour” or “as demand moves from routine tasks to cognitive, creative tasks”
- “a lot of companies may require workers who are creative and full of innovation” → “many companies will require creative, innovative workers” or “employers will seek creative, problem‑solving staff”
- “so that they can do some work that robots cannot do” → “to perform tasks that robots cannot” or “to handle jobs requiring judgement, creativity, and emotional intelligence”
- “Such kind of workers can bring them more profit and enhance the competence of the company in the market.” → “These workers can increase profitability and strengthen a company’s competitive advantage.”
- “So I think this prospect to global employment will definitely enhance.” → “Therefore, this shift can improve global employment prospects over the long term.” (use only if you need a concluding sentence)

5) How to strengthen the support (short guidance)
- Add one brief specific example (e.g., “product designers, AI trainers, creative directors” or “roles such as UX designers, AI supervisors, and strategy analysts”).
- Explain the link: show how creativity leads to profit (e.g., “creative workers develop new products/services, helping firms grow and hire more staff”).
- Keep sentences short and precise; avoid repeating the same idea.

6) Next step (choose one)
- A) Try rewriting the topic sentence now using one of the frames or options above. Paste it and I’ll give focused feedback.
- B) If you prefer, paste a 1–2 sentence revision of this paragraph (topic sentence + one support sentence) and I’ll give corrections/suggestions in small edits.

Which do you want to try now? Would you like to paste your attempted topic sentence, or shall I give a single suggested revision for you to adapt?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:19:19.897Z

**You:** "Moreover,  automation frees workers from tedious tasks, prompting companies to hire workers who add value in ways machines cannot ."This is my topic sentece,how can i make it better?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:31:39.763Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this sentence already makes the right idea clear. A few small changes will make it stronger, more precise, and better linked to your thesis.

Quick, focused feedback
- Connector: “Moreover” is fine, but “As a result,” “Consequently,” or “This shift” can show the sentence follows from the previous idea more clearly.  
- Precision: “workers who add value in ways machines cannot” is vague. Say which skills (creativity, judgement, emotional intelligence, etc.).  
- Nouns: prefer “employees,” “roles,” or “job categories” rather than repeating “workers.”  
- Tighten: remove extra spaces and keep the sentence concise.  
- Purpose: make it preview what the paragraph will explain (how these skills create new jobs or lead to hiring).

Three revised options you can choose or adapt
- Option A (direct, concise): As a result, automation frees employees from routine tasks and prompts employers to seek workers with creativity, judgement, and interpersonal skills that machines cannot replicate.
- Option B (with examples): Consequently, automation reduces tedious work and creates demand for new roles — such as UX designers, AI trainers, and machine supervisors — that require human creativity and oversight.
- Option C (emphasis on outcome): This shift toward cognitive tasks increases demand for creative and strategic workers, prompting firms to hire people for jobs machines cannot perform and thereby expanding long‑term employment opportunities.

Which feels closest to your voice? Try adapting one of these (or rewrite your original sentence using the points above) and paste your version here. Once you’re happy with the topic sentence, we’ll revise the paragraph’s supporting sentences to match it. Would you like to try now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:31:59.592Z

**You:** A

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:32:57.857Z

**Assistant:** Great — clear choice. Quick confirmations before we revise:

- Target: revise the topic sentence and the supporting sentences of the paragraph that begins “Moreover…” (keep the thesis as we agreed). Correct? If yes, I’ll assume we proceed with that paragraph.

- Topic sentence you picked (Option A):
  “As a result, automation frees employees from routine tasks and prompts employers to seek workers with creativity, judgement, and interpersonal skills that machines cannot replicate.”
  Do you want to keep this exact sentence? (If yes, we’ll use it as the paragraph’s first sentence. If you want a small tweak, say which word to change.)

How to revise the paragraph’s supporting sentences — short, practical guidance
1) Unity: Every supporting sentence must clearly explain or illustrate how demand for creative/judgement skills leads to more or better employment. Don’t drift back into repeating the thesis.

2) Evidence & development (one or two short moves)
   - Give 1 concrete example of new roles (choose 1–2): e.g., UX designers, AI trainers, machine supervisors, product designers, data annotators.
   - Explain the causal link: how these roles create value (develop products, ensure systems work, adapt AI), which helps firms grow or meet needs — then firms hire more people.
   - Optional short outcome sentence: link back to employment (expands opportunities, raises wages for skilled roles, encourages reskilling).

3) Coherence: Use clear connectors to show cause and effect:
   - Try: “For example,” “This means that,” “Consequently,” “As a result,” “Therefore.”

4) Language fixes to watch (small things to correct)
   - Use “labour” or “labor” consistently (American vs British). Be consistent with spelling.
   - Use “judgement” (British) or “judgment” (American) — pick one style.
   - Avoid vague phrases like “a lot of” — use “many,” “several,” or a number of.
   - Use precise nouns: roles, positions, job categories, employees.

Short sentence frames you can use to write the supporting sentences (fill in the blanks)
- “For example, roles such as ___ and ___ require human creativity and oversight to ___, so firms hire people to ___.”
- “These positions add value because ___, which helps firms ___ and therefore ___ (hire/expand/pay more).”
- “Consequently, the shift increases demand for trained workers and encourages investment in reskilling programs such as ___.”

A minimal three-sentence structure you can follow inside the paragraph
1. Topic sentence (we have this).
2. Example + quick explanation (use one of the frames).
3. Result/outcome linking back to employment (short conclusion sentence).

Your turn — try now (short task)
- Please write two supporting sentences for the paragraph using the frames above (not the whole paragraph). Keep each sentence short (one line). Paste them here and I’ll give focused corrections and suggest one concise final version for that paragraph. Once you confirm those sentences, I will include the full essay with that paragraph updated if you want. Would you like to try those two sentences now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:33:18.345Z

**You:** However, I think these examples can be used in the paragraph starting with "First", but not in the paragraph starting with "Moreover". What do you think?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:37:55.016Z

**Assistant:** Good insight — you’re thinking like a revision-savvy writer. Short answer: you’re right that the concrete examples (robot maintenance, data annotation, software development) fit best in the paragraph that explicitly argues automation “creates new types of work” (the “First” paragraph). The “Moreover” paragraph is about a different but related point — the shift in skill demand toward creativity, judgement, and interpersonal skills — so it should use examples that illustrate those kinds of roles.

Why that separation helps
- Clarity and unity: Each paragraph then has a single clear claim. First = automation creates new job categories (concrete technical roles). Moreover = automation shifts demand to higher‑order human skills (creative/strategic roles).  
- Development: Concrete technical examples support the “new jobs” claim; creative-role examples better show why firms will hire humans despite automation.  
- Flow: You can end the first paragraph with a short linking sentence that signals the shift to skills, so the “Moreover” paragraph follows logically.

Quick actionable choices (pick one)
A) Move the technical examples into the First paragraph, and keep the “Moreover” paragraph focused on creativity/judgement. Then I’ll help you revise whichever paragraph you want.
B) Keep the technical examples where they are, but change the “Moreover” paragraph’s examples so they match its focus (creative/strategic roles). I’ll help rewrite the topic sentence and supporting lines.

If you choose A, here are two short sentences you can insert (one into each paragraph) — adapt them in your own voice:

- To add to the First paragraph (technical job examples):  
  For example, automation has created roles such as robot maintenance, data annotation, and software development.

- To adjust the Moreover paragraph (creative/strategic examples):  
  For instance, firms increasingly seek UX designers, product managers, and AI-systems supervisors who can apply judgement, creativity, and interpersonal skills that machines lack.

If you prefer B (keeping examples where they are), rewrite the “Moreover” paragraph so its examples show high‑order skills (use the second sentence above).

What would you like to do now?
- Move the technical examples into the First paragraph (A), or  
- Keep them but change the “Moreover” paragraph examples (B)?  

If you tell me which, try pasting one sentence you’d like to add (or adapt one of the two short sentences above) and I’ll give focused feedback and help you integrate it smoothly. Would you like to try that now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:38:14.488Z

**You:** B) Keep the technical examples where they are, but change the “Moreover” paragraph’s examples so they match its focus (creative/strategic roles)

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:40:00.962Z

**Assistant:** Good choice — I’ve kept the technical examples in the first paragraph and changed the “Moreover” paragraph so its examples match the paragraph’s focus on creative and strategic roles. Below is the full essay with that paragraph revised. Read it and tell me if you want any small wording changes or if you’d like to revise the first paragraph next.

Nowadays, automation is developing sharply among all the industries. Although automation may eliminate some jobs in the short term, it will ultimately increase global employment in the long term by creating new types of work, raising demand for creative and strategic skills, and encouraging reskilling and innovation.
The development of AI and technology is the reason this type of automation can happen so quickly. Since we cannot stop the development of AI, we cannot stop the trends that most robots will replace most human workers. As of right now, you may think that this kind of shift will undoubtedly undermine global employment prospects, but this idea only examines this event in the short term. If we put our sight in the long term, it may turn to its opposite.
Firstly, a lot of new trends for workers emerge as a result of the rapid advancement of technology. Some traditional workplaces were replaced by robots and some new chances emerge. This lets more people sign up for new chances.
As a result, automation frees employees from routine tasks and prompts employers to seek workers with creativity, judgment, and interpersonal skills that machines cannot replicate. For example, firms increasingly hire UX designers, product managers, and AI trainers to develop user‑centred products, guide strategic decisions, and ensure automated systems behave reliably. These roles add value in ways automation cannot, encouraging companies to expand or create new positions and therefore improving employment prospects over the long term.
Last but not the least, if the prospects were undermined in the future, how can our world develop in a correct trend? Our world may lose its rank. It sounds a bit ridiculous so if we put our sight in a long term, the prospects get enhanced, our place to live can be a better place.
In this kind of era, we should try our efforts to improve the ability of ourselves, foster our own competence so that no one can replace us. Only ourselves get strong enough can us still stand still in a society even though changes are everywhere, every time. So I agree the prospects in global employment will enhance.
---

Quick notes on what I changed and why
- Topic sentence: I used the topic sentence we agreed on and kept it assertive and tied it to the thesis.
- Examples: I replaced technical examples in this paragraph with creative/strategic roles (UX designers, product managers, AI trainers) so the paragraph consistently supports the claim about skill‑shift and human roles machines cannot do.
- Link to employment: I added a short explanation of how those roles add value and lead companies to hire or expand, making the causal chain clearer.

Would you like to:
- Make any small wording tweaks to this paragraph, or
- Move next to revising the first paragraph (where the technical examples live), or
- Work on grammar and phrasing in this paragraph?

If you want to try a quick edit yourself first, paste your version and I’ll give focused feedback.

**You:** "For example, firms increasingly hire UX designers, to develop user‑centred products. This role adds value in a way automation cannot, encouraging companies to expand or create new positions and therefore improving employment prospects over the long term."These are sentences I wrote,I only kept one example.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T14:03:34.318Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that’s a clear improvement: one focused example is often stronger than several vague ones. I’ll give two tiny, targeted edits to tighten grammar and clarity, then show the full essay with those sentences integrated.

Quick feedback on your two sentences
- Remove the comma after “UX designers.” (“UX designers, to develop…” should be “UX designers to develop…”)  
- Use a slightly tighter second sentence: replace “This role adds value in a way automation cannot, encouraging companies to expand or create new positions and therefore improving employment prospects over the long term.” with a clearer version that avoids redundancy and reads smoothly.

Suggested small revision (you can accept or tweak)
- For example, firms increasingly hire UX designers to develop user‑centred products. This role adds value in ways automation cannot, encouraging companies to create or expand positions and thereby improving long‑term employment prospects.

Next steps — quick choices (pick one)
- Finish: You’re happy and want to stop here. Great work.
- Revise the first paragraph (the “Firstly…” paragraph) to add the technical-job examples and clean grammar.
- Improve the conclusion and final paragraph for clearer English and stronger ending.
- Do a focused grammar and phrasing pass for the whole essay (this goes beyond our agreed scope but I can do it if you want).
