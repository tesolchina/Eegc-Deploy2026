            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your training assessment report and chat history. Here is a clear summary and analysis based on the information you provided:

---

**Summary of Performance and Interaction**

1. **Essay Content and Revision Attempts:**  
   - The original essay demonstrated a reasonable structure with a clear stance and balanced points about individual and governmental roles in fighting climate change. However, vocabulary and grammar showed room for improvement.  
   - The student’s revised essay was not completed; it contained placeholders and meta-comments rather than refined arguments or polished writing. As a result, the intended improvements were not realized.

2. **Human-AI Interaction:**  
   - The AI assistant provided detailed scaffolding, stepwise guidance, and constructive feedback, clearly outlining the revision process (start with thesis, then topic sentence, then paragraph).  
   - The student engaged minimally and often sidestepped the revision tasks by “pretending” to have revised key components instead of submitting actual revisions.  
   - This limited the assistant’s ability to provide meaningful, iterative feedback, hindering progress.

3. **Interaction Quality:**  
   - Moderate engagement in terms of exchanges but low depth of revision input from the student.  
   - Lack of critical evaluation or acceptance/rejection of AI suggestions was observed.  
   - The revision process stalled with the student repeatedly avoiding submission of finalized thesis and topic sentences, essential for moving forward.

---

**Key Strengths**

- The student’s original essay clearly positioned the argument and showed an understanding of essay structure.  
- The AI assistant’s scaffolding was thorough, with explicit instructions and micro-tasks designed to empower student autonomy in revising.

---

**Areas for Improvement**

- The student needs to complete and submit concrete revisions (especially finalized thesis sentence and at least one fully revised body paragraph).  
- The student should actively engage with AI guidance, assess suggested rephrasings, and adopt or adapt recommendations with justification.  
- Greater attention to grammar, clarity, and formal academic language is required to enhance professionalism and readability.

---

**Recommendations for Next Steps**

1. **Revision Completion:**  
   Require the student to paste a finalized thesis statement adhering to the scaffold and then similarly provide a revised topic sentence and full paragraph text free from placeholders.

2. **Active Collaboration:**  
   Encourage the student to treat AI interaction as iterative editing dialogue, responding with drafts, explaining choices, and asking questions to deepen revision quality.

3. **Targeted Editing Support:**  
   Offer targeted grammar and vocabulary work, focusing on problematic constructions identified in the original essay.

4. **Assessment Policy:**  
   Only award credit for revision when actual revised content—not placeholders or meta-comments—is submitted, showing evidence of applying AI feedback.

---

If you would like, I can help by crafting example revisions following the AI assistant’s scaffolding model, or by creating a plan to support the student in becoming more engaged and producing completed drafts. Just let me know how you would like to proceed!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The essay presents a clear, balanced position (partial agreement) and identifies two relevant mechanisms (influencing government; personal lifestyle choices). Examples are general but appropriate: “if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy.” This shows awareness of cause-effect, though examples are not specific or evidenced.
- Organization: 21/25 - The essay has a clear introduction, two body paragraphs each addressing one main idea, and a conclusion that restates the stance. Paragraph progression is logical. Transitions and paragraph unity could be tightened (some sentences stray into vague concessions).
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Language is adequate and mostly appropriate ("pollution," "clean energy," "sustainable"), but vocabulary range is limited and some phrasing is informal or imprecise.
- Grammar: 15/25 - Several grammatical and phrasing errors reduce clarity (e.g., “But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action,” “so is not always working well,” “so this is problem,” “so it not really enough”). These errors sometimes interrupt flow and professionalism.
- **Original Essay Total: 75/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The revised submission contains placeholders and meta-text rather than substantive revision (e.g., “bla bla bla ... (revised thesis statement here)”), so the intended improvements are not realized. The original ideas remain but are not strengthened.
- Organization: 16/25 - Structural intent is visible, but placeholders interrupt coherence. For example, paragraph headings and instructions ("Revise the rest of body paragraph #1...") appear instead of a polished paragraph, harming flow and organization.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Vocabulary level is similar to the original where text exists, but the presence of placeholders and informal filler (“bla bla bla …”) lowers the overall quality and register.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Remaining original grammatical issues persist, and the inserted placeholders further reduce the formal quality. No substantive grammatical revision is shown.
- **Revised Essay Total: 62/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -13 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None substantive in the submitted revised essay; the student indicated intent to revise but did not provide finalized changes.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Finalize and replace the thesis placeholder with a clear, concise thesis that previews both main points (policy influence and individual behavior).
  - Revise a topic sentence to explicitly link to the thesis using the recommended scaffold (claim + mechanism + signpost).
  - Fully rewrite body paragraph #1 with a concrete example (specific protest, policy, or law) and a clearer explanation of causal mechanisms; correct grammatical errors and vague phrasing.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9** (assistant and user turns combined)
- **Conversation Quality:** The chat shows the assistant providing detailed scaffolding and process guidance. The student repeatedly declined to provide finalized revisions, using phrases like “let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement” and “bla bla bla…”, so the interaction did not produce completed edits. Example chat excerpts:
  - Assistant request for thesis: “Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?”
  - Student initial thesis paste: “I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”
  - Student later: “let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on bla bla bla …”
  - Assistant repeatedly asked for “Thesis finalized” and topic sentence; student did not supply finalized items.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - The assistant provided extended, useful guidance across multiple turns and the student engaged to an extent (pasted the original thesis and replied). However, the student did not follow through with actual revisions or extended questioning. The exchange count (9) indicates moderate engagement consistent with developing-level interaction.
  - Evidence: Multiple assistant scaffolding messages (e.g., instructions to revise thesis and topic sentences, checklists), but the student’s responses were brief and non-substantive (“let’s pretend…”, “bla bla bla…”).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - The chat does not show the student critically evaluating or accepting/rejecting specific AI suggestions. Instead, the student avoided completing tasks. There are no instances of the student weighing alternatives suggested by the assistant or providing justification for design choices.
  - Evidence: Assistant offered concrete scaffolds (“[Claim] + because [mechanism] + which results in [policy response]”), but the student did not present a revised thesis or topic sentence to accept or reject those suggestions.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - The assistant attempted to initiate iterative revision; however, the student did not engage in meaningful revision cycles. The process stalled at requests for the finalized thesis and topic sentence.
  - Evidence: Assistant repeatedly requested confirmation (“Thesis finalized”) and a topic sentence before proceeding; no iterative drafts were produced by the student.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear initial position and structure: The student’s original thesis clearly signaled a mixed stance and two supporting points; the essay uses a standard, coherent essay structure.
  - Evidence: Original thesis: “I partly agree … citizens can still influence the government … personal green lifestyle choices … still have a role to play.”
- The AI assistant provided strong, explicit scaffolding and process instructions for revising thesis, topic sentences, and paragraphs.
  - Evidence: Assistant messages include scaffolds for thesis and topic sentence structure and a checklist for paragraph revision.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Complete and submit actual revisions: Replace placeholders with concrete revised thesis, revised topic sentence, and a fully edited body paragraph.
  - Recommendation: Use the provided scaffold to create one concise thesis sentence and paste it into the chat for targeted feedback.
- Engage critically with AI suggestions: Rather than “pretend,” test and respond to AI proposals, accept or modify them, and provide reasons for choices.
  - Recommendation: When the assistant proposes a structure, produce a draft and explain why you accept or change specific wording.
- Address grammar and clarity issues: Fix repeated errors and informal phrases, especially in concession sentences and causal explanations.
  - Recommendation: After revising content, run a focused grammar pass on problem areas (e.g., subject-verb agreement, modal verbs, sentence connectors).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student provided the original thesis and course context initially, but failed to provide finalized materials the assistant repeatedly requested.
  - Evidence: Student pasted original thesis once, then declined to supply finalized thesis/topic sentence.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The assistant laid out a clear stepwise plan, but the student did not follow it to completion.
  - Evidence: Assistant’s stepwise process (“confirm thesis” → “choose paragraph” → “revise paragraph”) was not completed by the student.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - No evidence of the student evaluating AI suggestions or offering counterarguments.
  - Evidence: No revisions were shared to show acceptance, modification, or rejection of suggestions.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The student did not produce independent revisions beyond the original draft and placeholders.
  - Evidence: Revised essay contains placeholders (“bla bla bla ...”) rather than edited content.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Finalize and paste the revised thesis sentence into the chat before requesting paragraph-level help. Use the scaffold suggested: state position, acknowledge relative roles, and preview the two support points.
2. Produce one concrete revised topic sentence and one fully revised body paragraph (body paragraph #1 or #2) and paste them for targeted feedback. Include at least one specific example (country, law, protest, or business change).
3. Address recurring grammar errors by performing a focused editing pass or requesting specific grammar corrections for problematic sentences (e.g., replace informal phrases, fix subject-verb agreement, tighten concessions).
4. When using AI assistance, actively evaluate suggestions: accept, adapt, or reject them and explain your reasoning to demonstrate critical engagement and to allow more tailored AI support.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student did not complete the required revision tasks. The revised essay contains placeholders and meta-comments rather than the actual revised thesis, topic sentence, or paragraph content, so no substantive improvement can be validated.
- The assistant provided ample scaffolding and repeatedly requested a finalized thesis and topic sentence before revising a paragraph. The student repeatedly declined to provide finalized content (“let’s pretend…”, “bla bla bla …”), which prevented iterative revision.
- Recommended next steps for instructor: require submission of the finalized thesis and at least one fully revised paragraph (not placeholders) before awarding credit for the revision module. Encourage the student to engage concretely with the AI prompts and to document decisions made during revision for assessment of AI collaboration skills.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. bla bla bla ... (revised thesis statement here)

revised topic sentence bla bla bla …When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. Revise the rest of body paragraph #1...

*Time:* 2025-12-04T13:38:35.337Z

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-12-04T13:14:34.837Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T13:14:53.485Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for sharing your current thesis. That gives me a clear starting point.

Quick feedback on clarity, strength, and focus
- Strengths: Your position is clear: you “partly agree.” You hint at two clear reasons (influencing government; personal lifestyle choices), which is good for signposting the essay.
- Areas to improve:
  - Remove hedging phrases like “I believe” and “I also think.” Be direct and confident.
  - Make the degree of agreement precise and show the balance: acknowledge that governments/corporations have greater power but explain why individuals still matter.
  - Preview the two main points more explicitly and concisely so the reader knows the essay’s structure at a glance.
  - Combine into one precise sentence rather than several clauses.

How to revise (scaffold — not a full rewritten sentence)
- Begin by stating your position clearly: “I partly agree that…”
- Briefly acknowledge the stronger role of governments and corporations (one short phrase).
- Then preview the two reasons you will develop: (1) citizens can influence policy and political leaders, and (2) personal choices shape markets/social norms and send signals to businesses.
- End with a brief concluding clause that shows both levels are necessary (e.g., “therefore both individual action and systemic change are needed”).

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using that scaffold? Paste your revised sentence and I’ll give targeted feedback. I’ll wait until you’re happy with the thesis before we move on to choose a paragraph and revise its topic sentence.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T13:15:10.927Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-12-04T13:21:12.111Z

**Assistant:** Great — before we continue, please paste the revised thesis statement you (pretend) finished. I need to confirm you’re happy with it because Step 1 is mandatory. If you’d prefer, just type “Thesis finalized” to confirm and I’ll move on.

Once the thesis is confirmed, pick one body paragraph to work on (paragraph 2 about influencing government, paragraph 3 about personal lifestyle choices, or another paragraph). Then paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence (or tell me which one it is). 

Quick guidance about the topic sentence you’ll paste (so you’re ready):
- Check that it clearly links to your revised thesis (same position and balance).
- Aim for a claim + mechanism + signpost structure (not just a claim). Use this scaffold — NOT a full sentence — to guide you:
  - [Claim about individuals’ influence] + because [mechanism(s): e.g., voting, protests, petitions, public opinion] + which results in [type of policy or corporate response you will explain].
- Useful verbs/phrases to consider: mobilize, pressure policymakers, drive policy change, civic engagement, public pressure, electoral choices, collective action, consumer demand.

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now? Paste it (or say which paragraph) and I’ll give focused feedback to help you improve the connection to your thesis.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T13:21:34.055Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-12-04T13:32:51.569Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for the instruction to move ahead. Before I give focused help on revising the rest of a paragraph, I need two quick confirmations so we stay within the three-step process.

1) Thesis confirmation (mandatory)
- Please paste your revised thesis statement here, or type “Thesis finalized.” I must confirm you’re satisfied with the thesis before we continue.

2) Choose a paragraph and show the topic sentence
- Which body paragraph would you like to work on: paragraph 2 (influencing government) or paragraph 3 (personal lifestyle choices)?
- Paste the paragraph’s revised topic sentence here (just the topic sentence).

Once you post those two things, we’ll move to Step 3: revising the rest of the chosen paragraph. To prepare you, here’s a short, focused checklist and a few guiding prompts I’ll use (I won’t rewrite full sentences or the paragraph for you):

Checklist I’ll use to help revise the paragraph
- Unity: Do all sentences clearly relate to the topic sentence and the thesis?
- Coherence and flow: Are ideas ordered logically? Are transitions clear between points, example, and concession?
- Evidence and explanation: Does the paragraph include a concrete example or clear explanation that supports the topic sentence? Is the link between example and claim explicit?
- Concession/limitation (if present): Is it brief and followed by explanation of its relevance?
- Sentence-level clarity: Fix vague words (e.g., “maybe”), weak verbs, and grammar errors; vary sentence beginnings to avoid repetition.
- Closing/link sentence: Does the paragraph end by reinforcing the point and connecting to the thesis/next paragraph?

Guiding questions and micro-tasks I’ll ask you to do in your revision
- Point back to the thesis: “How does this paragraph’s main claim support your revised thesis? Add one short phrase that makes that link explicit if needed.”
- Strengthen evidence: “Can you name a specific example (country, law, protest, statistic) or briefly explain how the action led to policy change?”
- Clarify the limitation: “If you mention governments sometimes don’t act, can you replace vague wording with a concise cause (e.g., lack of political will, vested interests) and explain why that reduces impact?”
- Improve cohesion: “Would adding one transition sentence or phrase before the example help the flow? For instance, signal cause → effect or contrast → concession.”
- Tighten language: “Look for weak phrases like ‘maybe,’ ‘a little,’ ‘something happen’ — rewrite them into precise academic language (use one-word alternatives if helpful).”
- End with a linking sentence: “Finish with a line that restates how this paragraph’s evidence shows individuals can influence government (ties directly to thesis) or leads to the next point about consumer pressure.”

Would you like to try these changes now? Paste:
- Your finalized thesis (or say “Thesis finalized”), and
- Your chosen paragraph number and its revised topic sentence.

I’ll then give specific, targeted prompts and point out precise places in the paragraph to expand, clarify, or correct — still letting you do the actual rewriting.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T13:33:16.249Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1  bla bla bla...

*Time:* 2025-12-04T13:33:50.565Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m ready to help, but first we need to follow the required three-step process. Before I can help revise the rest of body paragraph #1, please do two quick things so we stay on track:

1) Thesis confirmation (mandatory)
- Paste your revised thesis statement here, or just type “Thesis finalized.” I must confirm you’re happy with it before we move on.

2) Topic sentence for body paragraph #1
- Tell me you’re working on the first body paragraph (the paragraph about influencing government) and paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence (just the topic sentence). If you’ve already revised it, paste the revised topic sentence.

Helpful reminder/scaffold for the topic sentence (use this to revise it yourself — don’t worry, I won’t rewrite it for you):
- Structure: [Claim about individuals’ political influence] + because [mechanism(s): voting, protests, petitions, public opinion] + which leads to [policy or government response you will explain].
- Strong verbs/phrases to consider: mobilize, pressure policymakers, shape public agendas, drive policy change, civic engagement, collective action.

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now? Paste both the finalized thesis (or “Thesis finalized”) and the topic sentence, and I’ll give focused feedback to help you improve the sentence before we revise the rest of the paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T13:34:08.566Z
