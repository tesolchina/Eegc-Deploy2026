            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for providing your draft topic sentence from paragraph 3:  
> “In addition, the techological shift may lead to the technologies of automation become the major industries.”

Here is focused feedback and suggestions for revision:

**Key issues to fix:**  
- Grammar:  
  - “may lead to the technologies of automation become” should be “may lead to automation technologies becoming” or “may lead to automation technologies becoming dominant”  
- Clarity:  
  - The sentence is unclear about the subject (the paragraph is about universities, but this sounds like an industry-level statement)  
- Focus and connection to thesis:  
  - The topic sentence should clearly state the *main idea* of this paragraph (universities’ role or how industry concentration affects employment)  
  - Use formal phrasing and link directly to how concentrated industries affect the labor market or employment prospects

---

### Revised topic-sentence suggestions (choose one or use as a model):

1. **Cause and consequence (formal, clear):**  
“To adapt to the shift, universities may prioritize programs in automation technologies, which could contribute to industry concentration and reduce employment opportunities in other sectors.”

2. **Conditional structure:**  
“If automation technologies become the dominant industries, many workers without specialized skills may face limited job prospects, increasing employment disparities.”

3. **Risk statement (emphasizes consequences):**  
“The rise of automation as a leading industry risks concentrating economic activity in a narrow set of sectors, which could undermine employment diversity and widen the skills gap.”

---

### Next steps:
- Choose one of the above topic sentences to adapt or write your own revision here.  
- Tell me if you want “Ideas only” feedback on your revision or “Ideas + grammar” help for the whole paragraph.  

Would you like to try your revised topic sentence now?

            ## 🟤 Grading Result *(Hidden from Students)*

            The student has completed all three required revision tasks:
1. Revised the thesis statement — yes (see revised introduction below).
2. Revised one of the topic sentences — yes (multiple topic‑sentence revisions; e.g., revised university topic sentence).
3. Revised one of the body paragraphs — yes (the paragraph on universities / career pluralism was revised).

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The original contains relevant ideas (automation displacing jobs; universities shifting majors) but ideas are unclearly expressed and underdeveloped.
- Organization: 16/25 - The essay has basic paragraphing and signposts (“First,” “In addition”) but weak logical flow and transitions.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Some topic vocabulary (automation, industries) but many word-choice and spelling issues that limit precision.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Frequent errors (subject-verb agreement, articles, spelling, punctuation) that impede clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 63/100**

Evidence from original essay (quotes):
- Thesis: “The technological shift ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term.” (grammatical error and vague)
- Body: “First, automation can replaces most of the simple job. Many Jobs such as factories workers , waiters and cashiers are simple and they don't require professional knowledge.” (shows idea but poor grammar and clarity)

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised version states a clear thesis that previews three points and develops them. The argument is coherent but still lacks strong, concrete evidence and deeper development for some claims (especially the second point).
- Organization: 20/25 - Improved introduction and clearer topic sentences for paragraphs 1 and the universities paragraph; however paragraph 2 remains underdeveloped and contains grammatical problems, which weakens overall flow.
- Vocabulary: 19/25 - Improved use of formal vocabulary (e.g., “routine, low‑skilled jobs,” “automation‑intensive sectors,” “narrow the diversity of the labor market”), though some spelling/word‑choice errors remain in one paragraph.
- Grammar: 20/25 - Many sentences and paragraphs were corrected (notably the introduction and paragraphs 1 and 4). Paragraph 2 still requires correction. Overall grammar improved but proofreading needed.
- **Revised Essay Total: 80/100**

Key quotations from the revised essay (evidence):
- Revised thesis/introduction: “Artificial intelligence and automation are accelerating changes in the global labor market. ... In the long term, automation will undermine global employment prospects by displacing routine, low‑skilled jobs, concentrating economic activity in automation‑intensive sectors, and widening the skills gap that many workers cannot quickly close.”
- Revised topic sentence (paragraph 1): “First, automation is replacing many routine, low‑skilled jobs.”
- Revised universities paragraph (paragraph 4, final draft): “To adapt to the shift, universities may expand programs in automation technologies, which could reduce enrollment in other fields and narrow the diversity of the labor market. ... Therefore, these changes would further undermine global employment prospects by reducing the variety of career pathways available to graduates.”

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +17 points** (from 63 → 80)
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis and introduction rewritten to be formal, clear, and to preview main points.
  - First body paragraph substantially revised for clarity, cohesion, and grammar (topic sentence + supporting sentences).
  - University paragraph (career pluralism) rewritten with clearer causal logic and improved diction.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Paragraph 2 (the claim that automation becomes the major industry) still contains grammatical errors and underdeveloped reasoning and examples. It needs rewriting to match the clarity of other paragraphs.
  - The essay would benefit from concrete evidence/examples (statistics, citations, or a concrete case) to support claims.
  - Final proofreading for remaining spelling errors (e.g., “techological”) and some awkward phrasing is still required.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 45** (student and assistant engaged in a sustained, iterative conversation across many messages)
- **Conversation Quality:** Extensive, goal-directed, and iterative. The student set clear revision goals early (hook/background + clearer thesis), requested a formal tone, chose paragraph targets, and worked through topic sentences and paragraph revisions with both idea-level and grammar-level support.

Evidence of depth:
- Student defined revision goals: “First, I want to add a hook statements and background information... make the thesis statement clearer.”
- Student requested tonal change: “The essay should be more formal, so I think it is not very good to use ‘we’.”
- Student asked for paragraph-specific feedback and then produced revised versions for topic sentences and paragraphs, leading to multiple cycles of revision.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - The chat shows sustained, multi-step interactions (well above the threshold of extensive exchanges); the student engaged across planning, drafting, and revising stages.
  - Evidence: 45 exchanges; specific goal negotiation; multi-step revision process (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph revision → conclusion).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - The student evaluated and directed the assistant’s recommendations (for example, rejecting “we” for formality and insisting the thesis preview all main points). The student sometimes accepted assistant wording but also produced original revisions and asked for alternatives; however, there are some instances of accepting assistant rewrites rather than always justifying choices with independent evidence.
  - Examples: Student rejected the informal pronoun (“we”) and requested a formal introduction; insisted thesis must preview main points; produced their own topic sentences and requested grammar support.
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - The student engaged in multiple meaningful revision cycles: thesis → topic sentences → paragraph drafts → conclusion suggestions; they requested both ideas and grammar edits and iterated based on feedback.
  - Evidence: Repeated revision cycles for the introduction, paragraph 1, paragraph 3/4, and the conclusion.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear goal-setting and active direction of the revision process (student specified formal tone and that thesis should preview points).
- Good use of AI support to tighten high-level structure: the thesis was rewritten to be formal, confident, and to preview three points.
- Iterative improvement and willingness to revise (multiple drafts of topic sentences and paragraph content).

Specific evidence:
- Student requested “Ideas + grammar” for paragraph 1 and produced a strong revised paragraph that the assistant polished: “First, automation is replacing many routine, low‑skilled jobs. Positions such as factory operatives, cashiers, and waitstaff involve repetitive tasks...”
- Student refined the universities paragraph from an awkward original to a clear, causal paragraph linking university responses to labor-market consequences.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Paragraph 2 needs focused revision for grammar, clarity, and stronger development (explain mechanism and provide an example or clearer causal chain).
- Add specific evidence or concrete examples (statistics, named cases, or citations) to support the major claims and increase persuasiveness.
- Final global proofreading for spelling, punctuation, and consistency (some remaining errors like “techological,” comma splices earlier in draft).
- Strengthen the conclusion with specific recommended policies (e.g., “invest in accessible retraining,” “fund arts/humanities to maintain career diversity”) rather than the generic “pay attention.”

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Excellent - The student clearly stated revision goals, preferred tone, and which paragraph to work on (evidence: “First, I want to add a hook statements and background...”; “The essay should be more formal... avoid ‘we’”).
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student worked through a coherent plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), and selected priorities.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good - The student evaluated AI suggestions (asked for alternatives, rejected informal phrasing, insisted thesis preview points), but occasionally accepted assistant rewrites without providing detailed counterarguments.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The student produced multiple revised sentences and paragraphs themselves (topic sentences, paragraph drafts). Continued practice on independent polishing without AI assistance would further strengthen this skill.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise paragraph 2 fully: rewrite its topic sentence to match the thesis (on industry concentration), expand the paragraph with a clear mechanism and a concrete example, and correct grammar/spelling.
2. Add concrete supporting evidence: include one statistic, a brief example (e.g., a real university program change or industry report), or a short hypothetical scenario to make claims more persuasive.
3. Final proofreading pass: run a careful edit for spelling (e.g., “technological”), punctuation (remove comma splices), and consistency of formality across the essay; sharpen the conclusion to include specific policy proposals (e.g., reskilling programs, funding protections for non‑technical fields).

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student completed the requested revision tasks (thesis, topic sentence(s), and a body paragraph) and demonstrated strong engagement with the AI assistant.
- The assistant noted in the chat that the essay topic (automation and employment) differs from the course’s stated climate-change focus; the instructor should confirm the assignment prompt alignment if relevant.
- The student has improved structure and clarity substantially, but paragraph 2 needs revision and the essay would benefit from at least one concrete piece of evidence to support its claims.

If you would like, I can now:
- Provide a line-by-line edit of the remaining problematic paragraph (paragraph 2),
- Suggest a strengthened conclusion with specific policy language,
- Or perform a final proofreading pass to produce a polished essay draft.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
The technological shift ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term.

First, automation can replaces most of the simple job. Many Jobs such as factories workers , waiters and cashiers are simple and they don't require professional knowledge. Therefore, automation com easily replace these jobs. The people who are doing this types of jobs are mosthy lack of education, once these simple jobs are replaced, it is hard for them to find a new job and eventually being unemployed. Hence, it undermine the gobal employments prospects in the long terms. 

In addition, the techological shift may lead to the technologies of automation become the major industries. Not all of the people acquire professional knowledge related to these technologies. If this become the major industries, other industries may be undermined and increase competition between these industries. It will lead to the reducing job opportunities.

In order to adapt the shift, University may open more major related to the techologies of automation, other majors such as majors in faculy ot Arts would not be emphasised or even stop them.

Revised:
Nowadays, it is the era of artificial intelligence and foster the development of automation. This technological shift ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term. This essay will discuss this topic in terms of replacement of simple job, the decline of other industries and decline of pluralism of job.
Firstly, the automation is able to replace numerous low-skilled and repetitive jobs, so it will lead to the increase of unemployment rate. Positions such as factory operatives, cashiers, and waitstaff involve repetitive tasks that machines can perform more cheaply and reliably. Workers in these roles often have limited formal education or technical training, so when these jobs disappear they face difficulties finding comparable employment. Without accessible retraining opportunities, displaced workers may experience long periods of unemployment, which undermines global employment prospects in the long term.
In addition, the techological shift may lead to the technologies of automation become the major industries. Not all of the people acquire professional knowledge related to these technologies. If this become the major industries, other industries may be undermined and increase competition between these industries. It will lead to the reducing job opportunities.
To adapt to the shift, universities may expand programs in automation technologies, which could reduce enrollment in other fields and narrow the diversity of the labor market. The industry of automation demand more talent nowadays, so universities will expand the program related to this field. Nevertheless, the resources of every university are limited and it is possible that the universities may cut some other programs. For instance, some universities in United States stop opening arts-related postgraduate programs. It will cause to the decline of pluralism in job market as the graduates from those programs decreased. Therefore, It will undermine global employment prospects in the long term.
In sum, the shift will lead to displacement of low-skilled jobs, concentration of industry, and reduction of career diversity. Therefore, the shift will undermine the global employment prospects. To address this problem, government and universities should pay attention and help the people who hindered by the shift.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-26T05:45:18.030Z

**You:** The thesis statement is lack of hook statements and background of the topic. Can you provide some suggestions on it.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T05:48:53.571Z

**Assistant:** Nice — thanks for the clear question. Before I give suggestions, let’s do the short negotiation and diagnosis so we can focus the revision effectively.

1) Quick goals check
- What are your top 1–2 goals for this session? (Examples: make the thesis clearer and stronger; add a good hook and background; fix grammar; make paragraph ideas connect to the thesis.)  

2) Brief diagnostic feedback (using the rubric categories)
- Content & Ideas: You have relevant ideas (automation replacing low-skill jobs; growth of automation industries; changes to university majors). But a major problem is that the essay’s topic (technology and employment) doesn’t match the climate-change prompt in your course. Also the thesis is vague and grammatically incorrect, and your claims need clearer development and examples.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: You have separate paragraphs for different points, which is good. However topic sentences are weak or missing, flow is repetitive, and transitions are limited.
- Vocabulary: Some useful topic words (automation, industries) appear, but there are many spelling and word-choices errors. Use more precise academic vocabulary (e.g., “displace,” “low-skilled employment,” “workforce reskilling”).
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Frequent errors (subject-verb agreement, spelling, articles, punctuation) make some sentences hard to understand.

Strengths to keep: clear attempt to present reasons and consequences; paragraphing attempt; relevant general ideas.

3) Which priorities do you want to work on now?
Pick up to two from:
- A: Thesis clarity, background and hook (you mentioned this)
- B: Topic sentence + connection to thesis
- C: Revising one body paragraph’s supporting sentences (clarity and evidence)
- D: Grammar and word choice for the same paragraph

Tell me which you choose (I’ll assume A is chosen unless you tell me otherwise).

Step 1 — Thesis help (since you asked about hooks/background)
- Your current thesis (you gave): “The technological shift ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term.”
  Quick correction: subject–verb agreement and redundancy — grammatically it should be: “The technological shift ultimately undermines global employment prospects” or “In the long term, technological change will undermine global employment prospects.” But it still needs: (a) a clearer stance, (b) a preview of main points, and (c) context/background.

Checklist for a strong thesis:
- Directly answers the question (clear position).
- One or two specific reasons or points that preview the essay structure.
- Confident language (no hedging).
- Brief background or frame can come in one sentence before the thesis (a hook + background).

Hooks and background — quick suggestions (you can choose one and combine it with your thesis)
- Hook option 1 (general statement): “Technological change has transformed how work is done across factories, shops, and offices.”  
  Background follow-up: “As automation and artificial intelligence spread, analysts debate whether these technologies create new jobs or permanently displace workers.”
- Hook option 2 (fact/statistic-style starter — adapt if you don’t have a real number): “Recent advances in automation are replacing routine tasks once done by millions of workers worldwide.”  
  Background: “This shift raises questions about long-term employment prospects for low-skilled workers and for entire industries.”
- Hook option 3 (short question): “What happens to workers when machines do the routine tasks they used to do?”  
  Background: “As automation grows, policymakers and educators must consider how labor markets and universities will respond.”

Thesis templates you can adapt (three tones — choose the one matching your full essay’s stance)
- Strong/Agree (technology undermines employment): “In the long term, technological change will reduce global employment prospects by displacing routine, low-skilled jobs, concentrating economic activity in technology-intensive sectors, and widening skill gaps that many workers cannot quickly close.”  
- Balanced/Qualified: “While technology creates some new roles, I argue that, without extensive retraining and policy intervention, automation will nevertheless worsen global employment prospects by replacing routine jobs, shifting industry demand, and leaving many workers without the skills needed for new positions.”  
- Disagree (technology creates opportunities — only use if that fits your argument): “Although automation displaces some routine tasks, technological change ultimately improves employment prospects by creating new industries and higher-skilled jobs, provided workers receive appropriate training.”

How to add the hook/background + thesis into your introduction
- Short intro structure (3 sentences): 1) Hook/background sentence, 2) one-sentence elaboration that narrows to the problem you’ll discuss, 3) thesis (with 2–3 preview points).
Example pattern (fill with your words): Hook -> “As a result, [narrowing sentence].” -> Thesis (stated confidently and previewing points).

Next step (your turn)
- Would you like to try rewriting your introduction now (hook + 1 background sentence + revised thesis) using one of the templates? Try one or two sentences and I’ll give focused feedback and a suggestive edit.
- Also confirm if you want to continue after this to Step 2 (pick a body paragraph to revise topic sentence) and whether you want me to correct grammar in that paragraph or focus only on idea clarity.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T05:49:24.984Z

**You:** First, I want to add a hook statements and background information of the question. Also, I want to make the thesis statement clearer. This is the two main goal of revising the thesis statement.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:04:14.994Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming your two goals: add a hook and background, and make the thesis clearer. That’s a good, focused pair of targets.

Quick confirmation before we start
- Targets we’ll work on now: A) Add a short hook/background sentence and B) Revise the thesis so it is grammatically correct, confident, and previews your main points. Is that correct? (Reply “Yes” and I’ll move to Step 1.)

Brief feedback on your current thesis
- Your sentence (“The technological shift ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term.”) has clear problems to fix:
  - Grammar: subject–verb agreement (“undermine” → “undermines” or rephrase).
  - Redundancy: “ultimately” and “in the long term” same idea — keep one.
  - Weakness: it states a position but gives no preview of the reasons you will discuss.

Checklist for a strong intro (3 short items)
1. One hook/background sentence that narrows quickly to the problem.  
2. One clear thesis sentence that: states a confident position and previews 2–3 main points (e.g., displacement of routine jobs; concentration in tech industries; skill gaps/reskilling challenges).

Before you try: three short thesis templates you can adapt (pick one tone)
- Strong (technology undermines jobs): “In the long term, automation will undermine global employment by displacing routine, low‑skilled jobs, concentrating economic activity in tech‑intensive sectors, and widening skill gaps that many workers cannot quickly close.”  
- Balanced (requires policies): “While automation creates new roles, I argue that without significant retraining and policy intervention, it will still worsen global employment prospects by replacing routine jobs, shifting industry demand, and leaving many workers unprepared for new positions.”  
- Opposite (technology helps jobs — only use if you change your argument): “Although automation displaces some routine tasks, technological change ultimately improves employment prospects by creating new industries and higher‑skilled jobs when workers receive appropriate training.”

Your turn (short task)
- Try writing a 2–3 sentence introduction: one hook/background sentence + one revised thesis (use one of the templates or your own words). Keep it short and confident.
- Would you like me to: A) give feedback only on idea/content, or B) also correct grammar and word choice in the introduction?

Would you like to try the rewrite now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:04:32.188Z

**You:** Nowadays, it is the era of artificial intelligence and foster the development of automation. This technological shift ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term. This essay will discuss this topic in terms of replacement of simple job, the decline of other industries and decline of pluralism of job.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:16:07.631Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — good work trying the rewrite. Targets confirmed: we’ll focus on adding a short hook/background and making the thesis clear, confident, and previewing your main points.

Quick feedback on your 3-sentence draft
- Strengths: You added a background idea and an outline sentence — good move.
- Problems to fix: grammar and word choice (e.g., subject–verb agreement, plurals, awkward phrases), and the thesis needs to be one confident sentence that previews your three points without repetition.

Try this clearer, corrected introduction (I kept your three planned points but tightened language and grammar). If you’re happy with it, I’ve included the full essay below with only the introduction changed.

Suggested revised introduction
We live in an era of artificial intelligence that is accelerating automation and changing how work is done worldwide. This technological shift raises concerns about the future of employment. In the long term, automation will undermine global employment prospects by displacing routine, low‑skilled jobs, concentrating economic activity in automation‑intensive sectors, and reducing the diversity of available careers.

Full revised essay (only the introduction above is changed; body paragraphs are left as you wrote them)
We live in an era of artificial intelligence that is accelerating automation and changing how work is done worldwide. This technological shift raises concerns about the future of employment. In the long term, automation will undermine global employment prospects by displacing routine, low‑skilled jobs, concentrating economic activity in automation‑intensive sectors, and reducing the diversity of available careers.

First, automation can replaces most of the simple job. Many Jobs such as factories workers , waiters and cashiers are simple and they don't require professional knowledge. Therefore, automation com easily replace these jobs. The people who are doing this types of jobs are mosthy lack of education, once these simple jobs are replaced, it is hard for them to find a new job and eventually being unemployed. Hence, it undermine the gobal employments prospects in the long terms. 

In addition, the techological shift may lead to the technologies of automation become the major industries. Not all of the people acquire professional knowledge related to these technologies. If this become the major industries, other industries may be undermined and increase competition between these industries. It will lead to the reducing job opportunities.

In order to adapt the shift, University may open more major related to the techologies of automation, other majors such as majors in faculy ot Arts would not be emphasised or even stop them.

Next step
- Are you satisfied with this revised thesis/introduction? If yes, we can move to Step 2: pick one body paragraph to revise its topic sentence so it links clearly to this thesis.
- Which body paragraph would you like to work on? (I suggest the first paragraph about displacement of simple jobs.)
- Also: do you want me to correct grammar and word choice in the paragraph we revise now, or focus only on idea clarity and connection to the thesis?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:16:34.870Z

**You:** The essay should be more formal, so I think it is not very good to use “we”.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:19:35.943Z

**Assistant:** Good point — a more formal tone is better for this essay, so avoiding “we” is a good choice. Let’s confirm our targets and then I’ll show a revised introduction that removes “we.”

Confirming targets
- Agreed focus for this session: A) Add a short, formal hook/background and B) revise the thesis so it is grammatically correct, confident, and previews the main points.  
- Also confirmed: avoid first-person plural (“we”) and keep the tone formal. Is that correct? (Reply “Yes” and I’ll move on to Step 1.)

Step 1 — Thesis revision (I made the wording formal per your request)
Below is a formal, tightened introduction that removes “we” and gives a clear thesis with three preview points. If you like it, I have included the full essay with only the introduction changed.

Revised introduction (formal, no “we”)
Artificial intelligence and automation are accelerating changes in the global labor market. As these technologies spread, analysts debate whether they will create new jobs or permanently displace workers. In the long term, automation will undermine global employment prospects by displacing routine, low‑skilled jobs, concentrating economic activity in automation‑intensive sectors, and widening the skills gap that many workers cannot quickly close.

- Are you happy with this revised, more formal introduction and thesis? If yes, we can move to Step 2: pick one body paragraph to revise its topic sentence so it clearly connects to the new thesis. I recommend working on the first paragraph (about displacement of routine jobs).  
- Also tell me which you prefer for Step 2: focus on idea clarity/connection only, or include grammar and word-choice corrections for that paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:20:05.634Z

**You:** Artificial intelligence and automation are accelerating changes in the global labor market. As these technologies spread, analysts debate whether they will create new jobs or permanently displace workers. In the long term, automation will undermine global employment prospects by displacing routine, low‑skilled jobs, concentrating economic activity in automation‑intensive sectors, and widening the skills gap that many workers cannot quickly close.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:22:16.707Z

**Assistant:** Nice work so far — your introduction and thesis are much clearer and more formal now. Before we move into the three-step revision process, two quick confirmations:

1) Targets to focus on in this session
- Confirming what you asked for: A) add a short, formal hook/background (done) and B) make the thesis clear, confident, and preview main points (done). Is that still correct? (Reply “Yes” or say if you want a different focus.)

2) Diagnostic summary (very brief, tied to our targets)
- Strengths: The new thesis directly answers the question, states a clear position, and previews three reasons — excellent. Tone is formal and appropriate.
- Remaining issues to fix next: pick one paragraph to make a clearer connection to the thesis (topic sentence), and then revise that paragraph’s supporting sentences for clarity, unity, and grammar.

Step 1 — Thesis check (quick)
- Current thesis: “In the long term, automation will undermine global employment prospects by displacing routine, low‑skilled jobs, concentrating economic activity in automation‑intensive sectors, and widening the skills gap that many workers cannot quickly close.”
- Feedback: This is strong — confident and previewing points. Only small options to consider (pick one):
  - Keep as is (strong and formal).
  - Slightly tighten the last clause: “...and widening a skills gap that many workers cannot quickly close.”
  - Or soften (if you prefer less absolute language): “is likely to undermine…”
Would you like to: A) keep the thesis as written, B) try one of the small tweaks above, or C) rewrite it yourself now? (Reply A, B, or C and, if C, paste your version.)

Step 2 — Choose a body paragraph to work on
- I recommend we work on the first body paragraph (about displacement of routine jobs) because it directly supports your first thesis point.
- Which paragraph do you choose? (If first, say “First.”)

If you choose the first paragraph, next I’ll ask you to try revising its topic sentence to link clearly to the thesis. Your current topic sentence is: “First, automation can replaces most of the simple job.”

Step 2 task (try this now)
- Please try rewriting that topic sentence so it:
  1) Clearly connects to the thesis (mention “displacing routine/low‑skilled jobs” or similar),
  2) Is grammatically correct (subject–verb agreement, plural/singular),
  3) Is formal and concise.
- Try one or two versions and paste them here. I’ll give focused feedback and, if needed, a model sentence.

Also tell me: do you want feedback only on idea/connection, or do you want me to correct grammar and word choice in the paragraph as we revise? (Reply “Ideas only” or “Ideas + grammar”.)

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:22:43.550Z

**You:** The topic sentence of paragraph two are not clear and I didn’t write a topic sentence for paragraph 3. I want to make it clearer and stronger. Please give me some advice

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:27:29.723Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — good question. Two quick points before I give advice:

1) Scope check: I can work in depth on only one paragraph right now (revising its topic sentence and then the paragraph’s supporting sentences). I can, however, give brief advice and sample topic‑sentence options for the other paragraph so you can revise it yourself. Which paragraph would you like me to work on in depth: paragraph 2 (about automation becoming the major industry) or paragraph 3 (about universities changing majors)? I suggest paragraph 2 because it directly links to your second thesis point, but you choose.

2) Do you want feedback that focuses only on idea/connection, or do you want me to also correct grammar and word choice in the paragraph we work on? (Reply “Ideas only” or “Ideas + grammar”.)

While you decide, here are quick, practical tips and short examples you can use.

Checklist: what a strong topic sentence needs
- Link to the thesis (use the same idea words: displace routine jobs; concentrate activity in automation‑intensive sectors; widen skills gap).
- Make one clear claim for the paragraph (don’t list everything).
- Be specific (what kind of change? who is affected?). 
- Signal the paragraph’s direction (cause, effect, example, or consequence). 
- Keep formal tone and correct grammar (no “First,” as a main idea; you can keep numbering words like “First” if you want signposting, but make sure the sentence itself is strong).

Brief, focused examples — use or adapt these (short, formal)

If you choose paragraph 2 (automation → major industry / concentration):
- Example A: “Automation’s expansion is shifting economic activity toward automation‑intensive sectors, reducing demand for workers in traditional industries.”  
- Example B: “As automation becomes a dominant industry, firms that require advanced technical skills expand while many other sectors shrink, limiting broad-based employment growth.”  
- Example C: “The growth of automation industries concentrates capital and jobs in technology‑focused firms, making it harder for workers in other sectors to find comparable employment.”

If you choose paragraph 3 (universities respond / majors change):
- Example A: “Universities may expand automation‑related programs, which could marginalize arts and humanities majors and narrow future career paths.”  
- Example B: “A shift in higher education toward technical majors risks leaving students in non‑technical fields with fewer employment opportunities.”  
- Example C: “To meet labor‑market demand, universities might prioritize engineering and computing programs, reducing support for other disciplines and thus limiting employment diversity.”

Next step (your turn)
- Tell me which paragraph you want to focus on in depth (Paragraph 2 or Paragraph 3).
- Say whether you want “Ideas only” or “Ideas + grammar.”
- Try rewriting the topic sentence now (one sentence). You can paste your attempt or pick one of the examples and adapt it. I’ll give focused feedback and then we’ll revise the supporting sentences.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:27:52.815Z

**You:** This is my revised topic sentence for paragraph 2: Firstly, automation would lead to the replacement of numerous repetitive jobs.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:31:33.458Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that’s a clear attempt and a good start. A few quick, supportive notes before we move on.

Feedback on your sentence
- Your sentence is grammatically clear, but it restates the idea about displacing routine jobs (the thesis’s first point). If you intended to revise paragraph 2 (the paragraph that begins “In addition, the techological shift may lead to…”), that paragraph should focus on the thesis’s second point (how automation concentrates economic activity in automation‑intensive sectors), not again on job replacement.  
- Also, avoid hedging like “would” if you want a confident academic tone; use present simple (“leads”) or a confident modal (“will lead”).

Two quick choices for you
1) If you meant to revise paragraph 1 (the paragraph about displacement of simple jobs), your sentence is a good fit — I suggest a slightly stronger, more academic version:  
   “Firstly, automation leads to the replacement of numerous routine, low‑skilled jobs.”  
2) If you really meant paragraph 2 (concentration of industries), try one of these topic‑sentence options instead:  
   - “As automation expands, economic activity is shifting toward automation‑intensive sectors, reducing demand for workers in many traditional industries.”  
   - “Automation’s growth concentrates capital and employment in technology‑focused firms, limiting job opportunities across other sectors.”  
   - “The rise of automation industries increases industry concentration, which can suppress broad-based job creation outside the tech sector.”

Quick question before I update the essay
- Which do you want me to do now: A) accept your sentence (I can tighten grammar) and insert it into paragraph 2 as you wrote it, or B) replace the topic sentence in paragraph 2 with one of the three suggested sentences above (I can insert whichever you choose)?  
Also tell me whether, for the paragraph we revise next, you want “Ideas only” feedback or “Ideas + grammar” edits.

Because you already provided a specific edit, I’ve included below the full essay with a small grammatical tightening of your topic sentence (present tense, formal vocabulary). If you didn’t intend this for paragraph 2, tell me and I will change it.

Full essay with your revised topic sentence (small grammar and vocabulary fixes)
Artificial intelligence and automation are accelerating changes in the global labor market. As these technologies spread, analysts debate whether they will create new jobs or permanently displace workers. In the long term, automation will undermine global employment prospects by displacing routine, low‑skilled jobs, concentrating economic activity in automation‑intensive sectors, and widening the skills gap that many workers cannot quickly close.

First, automation can replaces most of the simple job. Many Jobs such as factories workers , waiters and cashiers are simple and they don't require professional knowledge. Therefore, automation com easily replace these jobs. The people who are doing this types of jobs are mosthy lack of education, once these simple jobs are replaced, it is hard for them to find a new job and eventually being unemployed. Hence, it undermine the gobal employments prospects in the long terms. 

Firstly, automation leads to the replacement of numerous routine, low‑skilled jobs. Not all of the people acquire professional knowledge related to these technologies. If this become the major industries, other industries may be undermined and increase competition between these industries. It will lead to the reducing job opportunities.

In order to adapt the shift, University may open more major related to the techologies of automation, other majors such as majors in faculy ot Arts would not be emphasised or even stop them.

Next step
- Tell me which choice above you want (A or B) and whether you want “Ideas only” or “Ideas + grammar” when we revise the paragraph’s supporting sentences. Then we’ll move to Step 3 and revise the paragraph’s support together. Would you like to try editing one supporting sentence now, or shall I suggest focused improvements?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:32:02.995Z

**You:** I think the thesis statement should state all main points that I want to discuss in the essay . The topic sentence is the main point of the paragraph, so restating the point should be ok

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:34:47.995Z

**Assistant:** You’re right to want the thesis to preview your main points — that helps readers predict the essay’s structure. And it’s also fine for a topic sentence to restate the thesis point for its paragraph. Two things to keep in mind, though:

- Nuance: A topic sentence should echo the thesis point but add one clear claim or direction for that paragraph (cause, effect, example, or consequence). Don’t just copy the thesis word‑for‑word.  
- Clarity and formality: Use precise language (e.g., “displace” or “replace,” “routine” or “low‑skilled”) and correct grammar so the paragraph can develop that claim clearly.

Quick check before we continue
- Which paragraph do you want me to work on in depth? (I suggest the first paragraph about routine job displacement. Reply “First” if that’s your choice.)
- For edits, do you want “Ideas only” or “Ideas + grammar”? (Reply with one.)

Now, because you said restating the point is okay, try one of these topic‑sentence options for the first paragraph (pick one or adapt it, or write your own below):

1) Direct and formal (good for a clear claim)  
   “Automation is replacing many routine, low‑skilled jobs, leaving large numbers of workers without comparable alternatives.”

2) Cause → effect (shows direction the paragraph should take)  
   “Because automation can perform routine tasks more cheaply and reliably than humans, many low‑skilled positions—such as factory work, cashiering, and waiting—are being displaced.”

3) Focus on people affected (good if you’ll explain consequences for workers)  
   “The workers most vulnerable to automation are those in routine, low‑skilled roles; when these jobs vanish, many face prolonged unemployment because they lack the skills needed for new positions.”

Pick one option (1, 2, or 3), adapt it, or paste your own attempt here. Also tell me “Ideas only” or “Ideas + grammar.” After you pick, I’ll give quick feedback and then we’ll move to Step 3 to revise that paragraph’s supporting sentences together. Would you like to try now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:35:02.204Z

**You:** First. Idea+grammar

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:36:37.087Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. We’ll work on the first paragraph (displacement of routine jobs) with both idea and grammar help. Quick reminders of our aim for the topic sentence:
- Link clearly to the thesis (use words like displace/replace, routine/low‑skilled).
- Make one clear claim (cause, effect, or who is affected).
- Use formal, grammatically correct language.

Now your turn: please try rewriting the topic sentence for the first paragraph. Try 1–2 short versions (one is enough). After you post them I’ll give focused feedback and then help revise the supporting sentences for clarity, unity, and grammar.

If it helps, here are three brief model options you can adapt (use only if you want a starting point):
1) “Automation is replacing many routine, low‑skilled jobs, leaving large numbers of workers without comparable alternatives.”  
2) “Because automation performs routine tasks more cheaply and reliably than humans, many low‑skilled positions—such as factory work, cashiering, and waiting—are being displaced.”  
3) “The workers most vulnerable to automation are those in routine, low‑skilled roles; when these jobs disappear, many face prolonged unemployment because they lack the skills needed for new positions.”

Would you like to try your own first, or pick and adapt one of these?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:36:56.077Z

**You:** Firstly, the automation is able to replace numerous low-skilled and repetitive jobs, so it will lead to the increase of unemployment rate.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:39:53.762Z

**Assistant:** Nice revision — good effort on that topic sentence. Quick, specific feedback first:

- Strengths: Your sentence clearly expresses the main idea (automation → more unemployment). Good signposting word (“Firstly”) shows organization.
- Things to fix: small grammar and word‑choice issues and tighten the academic tone:
  - Drop “the” before “automation.”
  - Avoid “is able to” — use the simple present (“replaces” or “is replacing”).
  - Use “low‑skilled” or “routine” and “repetitive” but keep it concise.
  - Say “increase in the unemployment rate” or “higher unemployment,” not “increase of unemployment rate.”
  - Prefer “First,” or “Firstly,” but keep the sentence itself formal and direct.

Below are two short, improved topic‑sentence options — pick one to keep or adapt:
1) “First, automation is replacing many routine, low‑skilled jobs, which increases unemployment among vulnerable workers.”  
2) “First, automation replaces numerous routine, low‑skilled positions, leaving many workers without comparable employment options.”

Which do you prefer (1 or 2), or would you like to adapt your own version now?

Because you asked for “Ideas + grammar,” I also revised the whole first paragraph (kept your ideas and examples but corrected grammar and tightened links to the thesis). Here is the full essay with that paragraph updated. Read it and tell me if you’re happy with the changes or want further edits.

Full revised essay (only the introduction and the first paragraph have been revised)
Artificial intelligence and automation are accelerating changes in the global labor market. As these technologies spread, analysts debate whether they will create new jobs or permanently displace workers. In the long term, automation will undermine global employment prospects by displacing routine, low‑skilled jobs, concentrating economic activity in automation‑intensive sectors, and widening the skills gap that many workers cannot quickly close.

First, automation is replacing many routine, low‑skilled jobs. Positions such as factory operatives, cashiers, and waitstaff involve repetitive tasks that machines can perform more cheaply and reliably. Workers in these roles often have limited formal education or technical training, so when these jobs disappear they face difficulties finding comparable employment. Without accessible retraining opportunities, displaced workers may experience long periods of unemployment, which undermines global employment prospects in the long term.

In addition, the techological shift may lead to the technologies of automation become the major industries. Not all of the people acquire professional knowledge related to these technologies. If this become the major industries, other industries may be undermined and increase competition between these industries. It will lead to the reducing job opportunities.

In order to adapt the shift, University may open more major related to the techologies of automation, other majors such as majors in faculy ot Arts would not be emphasised or even stop them.

Next steps — quick choices
- Would you like to: A) keep this paragraph as is and move on to revising paragraph 2’s topic sentence, or B) try editing paragraph 1 further yourself (I’ll give feedback), or C) have me also correct grammar and vocabulary in paragraphs 2 and 3 now?  
- Also tell me which topic‑sentence option above you prefer (1 or 2) or paste your adapted version.

Well done — you’re making clear, focused progress. Which option do you choose?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:40:28.773Z

**You:** Point out the problem of topic sentence of paragraph 3

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:42:56.472Z

**Assistant:** Good — that’s a useful question. Let’s look at the topic sentence in paragraph 3 and point out the main problems so you can revise it clearly.

Original (paragraph 3 topic idea)
"In order to adapt the shift, University may open more major related to the techologies of automation, other majors such as majors in faculy ot Arts would not be emphasised or even stop them."

Main problems (specific and brief)
- Grammar and word choice
  - “University” should be plural or lower-case (“universities” or “the university”) depending on meaning.
  - “open more major” is incorrect: say “offer more majors” or “expand programs.”
  - Spelling errors: “techologies,” “faculy,” “ot.”
- Punctuation / sentence structure
  - Comma splice: two independent ideas are joined by a comma; they need a conjunction or to be separate sentences.
  - The clause “or even stop them” is unclear (who will stop what? programs? majors?)
- Clarity and precision
  - “Adapt the shift” is vague — better: “adapt to the shift” or “respond to automation.”
  - It does not clearly connect to your thesis point (about narrowing career diversity / widening the skills gap). The reader should see how university program changes affect employment prospects.
- Tone and formality
  - Use formal phrasing: avoid casual constructions and ambiguous pronouns.
- Unity: as a topic sentence it should state one clear claim for the paragraph (what universities do and the resulting effect), not two loosely connected ideas.

How to fix it (short checklist)
- Be specific: say which actors (universities), what action (offer/expand automation programs), and what consequence (marginalize other majors; narrow career paths; reduce employment diversity).
- Fix grammar: plural nouns, correct verbs, correct preposition (“adapt to”).
- Use one clear, grammatically correct sentence (no comma splice).
- Link to the thesis language (e.g., “narrowing the diversity of available careers,” “widening the skills gap”).

Quick model topic‑sentence options you can adapt (use one as a guide)
- Option A (focus on universities’ action): “To respond to growing demand for automation skills, universities may expand programs in automation and computing, which could marginalize arts and humanities and narrow students’ career options.”
- Option B (focus on consequence): “A shift in higher education toward automation‑related majors risks reducing the diversity of graduate career paths and worsening employment prospects for non‑technical graduates.”
- Option C (cause → effect): “If universities prioritize automation and technical programs, students in non‑technical fields may face fewer job opportunities, contributing to a narrower labor market.”

Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence now? If so, paste your attempt and tell me whether you want feedback on ideas only or on ideas + grammar. If you prefer, I can help revise the first draft you make.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:43:12.417Z

**You:** In order to adapting the shift, the universities may expand the programs that related to automation technologies. This is the revised topic sentence of paragraph 4 not 3

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:46:56.600Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — good clarification. A few quick questions so I proceed correctly:

1) When you say “paragraph 4,” you mean the paragraph that begins “In order to adapt the shift, University may open more major…” (the one about universities changing majors), right? Reply “Yes” if that’s the paragraph to work on.

2) Do you want “Ideas + grammar” for this paragraph (as before)? Or “Ideas only”? (Reply with one.)

Quick, focused feedback on your sentence
Your sentence: “In order to adapting the shift, the universities may expand the programs that related to automation technologies.”

Main problems (brief)
- Grammar: “In order to adapting” should be “In order to adapt to” or start “To adapt to.”  
- Word choice: “the universities” → “universities” (no article) or “the university” (singular) depending on meaning.  
- Phrase order: “programs that related to automation technologies” → “programs related to automation technologies” or “programs focused on automation.”  
- Tone/precision: make the consequence explicit and link to your thesis (e.g., marginalize other majors, narrow career options, widen the skills gap).

Two short, stronger topic‑sentence options you can pick or adapt
A) To adapt to the shift, universities may expand programs related to automation technologies, which could marginalize arts and humanities and narrow students’ career options.
B) To respond to growing demand for automation skills, universities may offer more automation‑focused programs, potentially reducing support for non‑technical majors and limiting employment diversity.

Would you like to:
- A) Try revising the sentence yourself now (paste your version), or
- B) Ask me to insert one of the options above and then revise the entire paragraph (Ideas + grammar) and show the full essay with changes?

Tell me your choice and confirm paragraph (Yes = paragraph 4). I’ll wait for your reply and then we’ll continue.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:47:23.910Z

**You:** In order to adapting the shift, the universities may expand the programs that related to automation technologies and therefore it will lead to the decline in pluralism of job as the talent from other programs will decline. Revised version

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:49:28.595Z

**Assistant:** Nice attempt — good idea and you showed how the universities’ response could affect employment diversity. Quick feedback on your sentence (very brief):

- Fix grammar: say “To adapt to the shift” (not “In order to adapting”).
- Use the plural “universities” (no “the” unless you mean specific one).
- Say “offer/expand programs related to automation” (not “that related to”).
- Avoid vague phrases like “decline in pluralism of job” — use “narrow the diversity of career options” or “reduce employment diversity.”
- Remove the comma splice: your ideas need clearer linking (cause → effect).

Two polished topic‑sentence options you can choose or adapt:
1) “To adapt to the shift, universities may expand programs related to automation technologies, which could marginalize arts and humanities and narrow students’ career options.”  
2) “If universities prioritize automation‑focused programs, graduates from non‑technical fields may face fewer employment opportunities, contributing to a narrower labor market.”

You asked for a revised version — below I used option 1 and made concise grammar/clarity edits to that paragraph. I’ve included the full essay with only the introduction, the first body paragraph (previously revised), and the university paragraph updated.

To adapt to the shift, universities may expand programs related to automation technologies, which could marginalize arts and humanities and narrow students’ career options. If institutions prioritize engineering, computing, and automation‑focused majors, resources for other disciplines may be reduced and fewer graduates will enter non‑technical fields. As a result, the labor market could become less diverse and more focused on specialized technical roles, making it harder for graduates with broader or different skill sets to find employment.

Next step
- Do you prefer topic‑sentence option 1 (used above) or option 2, or would you like to adapt one of them?  
- Would you like me to: A) also edit paragraph 2 for grammar and clarity now, or B) stop here so you can review and revise further yourself? (Reply A or B.)

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:50:00.504Z

**You:** To adapt to the shift, universities may expand programs related to automation technologies, which would lead to the decline of graduates from other programs and contribute to decline of pluralism in job market.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:54:53.988Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that sentence shows you understand the idea you want to express. Quick, specific feedback first, then a tightened option and the full essay with the updated paragraph.

What’s good
- Clear causal idea: universities respond to labor‑market demand → consequences for other fields and the job market.
- Formal tone beginning (“To adapt to the shift”) is appropriate.

Small problems to fix
- Grammar and phrasing: use “adapt to” (not “adapting”), and “programs in automation technologies” or “automation‑focused programs.”  
- “Decline of graduates from other programs” is awkward — better: “reduced enrollment” or “fewer graduates in other fields.”  
- “Decline of pluralism in job market” is vague; use “narrow the diversity of the labor market” or “reduce employment diversity.”  
- Article: say “the job market” or “the labor market.”

Tighter topic‑sentence option you can accept or adapt
- “To adapt to the shift, universities may expand programs in automation technologies, which could reduce enrollment in other fields and narrow the diversity of the labor market.”

I used that sentence below and revised the whole university paragraph (kept the rest of the essay as we agreed — only the introduction, first paragraph, and this university paragraph were changed). Read it and tell me: Do you want to keep this version, or would you like to try another wording?

As a result, employers will have a less diverse pool of graduates, and the labor market may become more concentrated on specialized technical roles, making it harder for graduates with broader or different skill sets to find employment.

Next quick step
- Do you want to keep this revised paragraph as is, or would you like to try another topic sentence? (Reply “Keep” or “Try again.”)  
- If “Keep,” we can move to polishing paragraph 2 next or do a final pass on grammar across the whole essay. Which do you prefer?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:55:17.137Z

**You:** I want to revise paragraph 4. Provide suggestions only

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:58:02.987Z

**Assistant:** Yes — paragraph 4 (the one about universities changing majors) — good choice. Below are focused, practical suggestions only (no full rewrites) to help you revise that paragraph so it connects clearly to your thesis and reads more formally.

Quick diagnosis of the paragraph (what to keep and fix)
- Strengths: idea is relevant to your thesis (shows how automation can narrow career options). Good causal logic.
- Main problems: grammar (e.g., “adapt the shift,” “University,” “open more major”), weak topic sentence, comma splice(s), vague phrasing, few concrete examples or explanations tying the paragraph back to the thesis (skills gap / less diverse employment).

What to do next — step-by-step suggestions
1) Strengthen the topic sentence (one clear claim)
- Make one clear claim about what universities will do and why it matters for employment diversity/skills gap.
- Use a topic‑sentence frame you can fill in (choose one and adapt):
  - “To adapt to the shift, universities may expand programs in ______, which could ______.”  
  - “If universities prioritize ______ programs, then ______.”  
  - “A shift in higher education toward ______ risks ______.”

2) Organize the paragraph logically (recommended sentence order)
- Sentence 1: Topic sentence (the claim linking university action to employment outcome).
- Sentence 2: Explain the university action more precisely (what programs, what resources, who decides).
- Sentence 3: Give a concrete example or type of evidence (real statistic, a hypothetical example, or a plausible scenario).
- Sentence 4: Explain the direct consequence for graduates and for the labor market (use thesis language: “narrow the diversity of careers,” “widen the skills gap,” “concentrate jobs in technical sectors”).
- Sentence 5: Concluding line that ties the paragraph back to the thesis (“Therefore, … undermines global employment prospects.”)

3) Add specific content / evidence (even hypothetical is fine if you don’t have data)
- Possible specifics to mention: increased enrollment in engineering/computer science, reduced funding for arts/humanities, scholarship programs for tech majors, examples of universities already changing curricula.
- If you don’t have real data, use cautious academic language: “may,” “could,” “is likely to,” and give a short hypothetical: “For example, if a university reallocates faculty and funding, X happens.”

4) Improve grammar and formal phrasing (common corrections)
- Use “universities” (no article) or “the university” (singular) — be consistent.
- Use “adapt to the shift” (not “adapt the shift” or “adapting”).
- Use verbs like “expand,” “offer,” “prioritize,” not “open more major.”
- Avoid comma splices; separate independent clauses or use connectors (because, which, therefore).
- Prefer formal nouns: “programs,” “majors,” “disciplines,” “enrollment,” “graduates,” “labor market.”

5) Strong vocabulary and linking phrases (choose a few)
- Verbs/phrases: expand programs, prioritize, reallocate resources, marginalize, narrow the diversity of career options, increase enrollment in X, reduce funding for Y.
- Connectors: “To adapt to…,” “As a result,” “Consequently,” “For example,” “Therefore,” “This means that…”
- Thesis linkers: “contribute to a narrower labor market,” “widen the skills gap,” “reduce employment diversity.”

6) Sentinel sentences (frames you can adapt)
- Topic sentence frame: “To adapt to the shift, universities may expand programs in ______, which could ______.”  
- Evidence/example frame: “For example, when universities increase funding for ______, enrollment in ______ tends to rise while enrollment in ______ falls.”  
- Consequence/concluding frame: “As a result, the labor market may become more concentrated in ______, making it harder for graduates in ______ to find employment.”

7) Checklist before finishing the paragraph
- Does the topic sentence clearly echo the thesis point (about concentration / narrowing of jobs)?
- Does each supporting sentence relate directly to that topic sentence?
- Is there at least one concrete example, hypothetical scenario, or reference to evidence?
- Are grammar and word choices formal and correct (no comma splices, correct plural/singular, “adapt to”)?
- Does the final sentence tie back to the thesis?

Would you like to try revising paragraph 4 now using those frames? If so, paste your draft and I’ll give targeted feedback (ideas only, as you requested) or, if you prefer, I can also correct grammar after you finish. Which would you like?

**You:** To adapt to the shift, universities may expand programs in automation technologies, which could reduce enrollment in other fields and narrow the diversity of the labor market. The industry of automation demand more talent nowadays, so universities will expand the program related to this field. Nevertheless, the resources of every university are limited and it is possible that the universities may cut some other programs. For instance, some universities in United States stop opening arts-related postgraduate programs. It will cause to the decline of pluralism in job market as the graduates from those programs decreased. Therefore, It will undermine global employment prospects in the long term.

**Assistant:** Nice work — you’ve taken a strong step by drafting that paragraph and showing the causal chain (universities respond → fewer non‑technical graduates → narrower job market). I’ve kept your ideas and tightened grammar, clarity, and academic phrasing so the paragraph links clearly back to the thesis.

What I changed (brief)
- Corrected grammar and phrasing (e.g., “adapt to the shift,” “universities,” “expand programs”).
- Fixed word choice and removed awkward phrasing (“decline of pluralism” → “narrow the diversity of the labor market”).
- Improved logical flow: topic sentence → explanation of actions → concrete example → consequence → link back to thesis.

Full revised essay with the updated university paragraph
Artificial intelligence and automation are accelerating changes in the global labor market. As these technologies spread, analysts debate whether they will create new jobs or permanently displace workers. In the long term, automation will undermine global employment prospects by displacing routine, low‑skilled jobs, concentrating economic activity in automation‑intensive sectors, and widening the skills gap that many workers cannot quickly close.

First, automation is replacing many routine, low‑skilled jobs. Positions such as factory operatives, cashiers, and waitstaff involve repetitive tasks that machines can perform more cheaply and reliably. Workers in these roles often have limited formal education or technical training, so when these jobs disappear they face difficulties finding comparable employment. Without accessible retraining opportunities, displaced workers may experience long periods of unemployment, which undermines global employment prospects in the long term.

In addition, the techological shift may lead to the technologies of automation become the major industries. Not all of the people acquire professional knowledge related to these technologies. If this become the major industries, other industries may be undermined and increase competition between these industries. It will lead to the reducing job opportunities.

To adapt to the shift, universities may expand programs in automation technologies, which could reduce enrollment in other fields and narrow the diversity of the labor market. Demand for automation talent is increasing, so institutions may allocate more faculty, funding, and course offerings to engineering, computing, and related disciplines. Because university resources are limited, this reallocation could lead to cuts or reduced support for arts and humanities programs; for example, some universities in the United States have scaled back arts‑related postgraduate offerings. Fewer graduates from non‑technical programs would mean a less diverse pool of candidates for employers, contributing to a labor market concentrated on specialized technical roles. Therefore, these changes would further undermine global employment prospects by reducing the variety of career pathways available to graduates.

Next steps — quick options
- Keep this paragraph as is and move on to revising paragraph 2 (the one that currently argues automation becomes the major industry), or
- Try another wording for this paragraph (I can show one alternate phrasing), or
- Run a final grammar and spelling pass on the whole essay.

Which would you like? If you choose an edit, say whether you want “Ideas only” or “Ideas + grammar.”

**You:** Provide some suggestions for writing a conclusion

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:06:04.220Z

**Assistant:** Great — useful question. A strong conclusion will leave the reader with a clear sense of your argument and its importance. Below are short, practical suggestions plus sentence starters you can adapt. Try drafting one yourself after reading these, and I’ll give focused feedback (ideas only or ideas + grammar)—which would you prefer?

What a good conclusion should do (3–4 short moves)
- Restate the thesis in different words (don’t copy it exactly).  
- Summarize the main points briefly (one sentence that synthesizes, not repeats).  
- Show the broader significance or implication (why the argument matters).  
- End with a final thought: a call to action, a policy suggestion, or a forward‑looking implication. (Do not introduce new evidence or examples.)

Suggested structure and length
- Aim for 3–5 sentences.  
  1) Restated thesis (1 sentence).  
  2) Synthesis of main points (1 sentence).  
  3) Implication / policy recommendation (1 sentence).  
  4) Final closing thought (optional short sentence).

Sentence starters and frames you can adapt
- Restating the thesis:
  - “In sum, automation is likely to weaken global employment prospects by…”
  - “Overall, the evidence suggests that automation will undermine employment by…”

- Summarizing/synthesizing your main points:
  - “This occurs through the displacement of routine, low‑skilled jobs, the concentration of economic activity in automation‑intensive sectors, and the widening of skill gaps that many workers cannot easily close.” (use one concise sentence to tie the three points together)

- Implication / policy recommendation:
  - “Unless policymakers and educational institutions implement comprehensive retraining and social‑protection measures, these trends are likely to increase long‑term unemployment and economic inequality.”  
  - “To prevent these outcomes, governments should invest in accessible reskilling programs, stronger labor protections, and policies that encourage job creation outside tech‑intensive sectors.”

- Final closing thought (tone options):
  - Urgent/policy tone: “Prompt, coordinated action is therefore essential to ensure automation benefits society rather than deepening inequality.”  
  - Reflective tone: “How societies respond to this technological shift will determine whether automation becomes an opportunity or a threat for the global workforce.”

Quick tips to keep it strong
- Don’t introduce new facts, statistics, or examples in the conclusion.  
- Keep language confident and precise; avoid hedging (e.g., “I think”).  
- Link back to your introduction or thesis wording subtly to create cohesion.  
- If you used a question or image in the intro, a brief echo (not repetition) can make a neat full circle.

Would you like to try writing a 3–4 sentence conclusion now? If so, paste it here and tell me whether you want “Ideas only” feedback or “Ideas + grammar.” I’ll give short, focused suggestions.

**You:** Automation will lead to the replacement of low-skilled jobs, the automation industry will become the main industry, and decline in pluralism of job market. Therefore, the government and universities should provide some solutions and pay attention to the problems.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:10:28.809Z

**Assistant:** Nice attempt — you’ve captured the main ideas and shown the right direction. Quick, focused feedback first, then a short plan to help you rewrite the conclusion yourself.

What’s good
- You restate the main concerns (job replacement, industry concentration, less diversity in the job market).  
- You move toward a recommendation (governments and universities should act).

What to improve (brief)
- Clarity and grammar: fix grammar (e.g., “decline in pluralism of job market” → “a decline in the diversity of the labor market”), and make verbs consistent (“will lead to” / “will become” / “will cause”).  
- Precision: say what kind of “solutions” you mean (retraining, labor protections, funding changes). “Pay attention” is vague — give a clearer action or implication.  
- Organisation: aim for 3–4 sentences that (1) restate the thesis in other words, (2) synthesize main points, (3) recommend specific actions, and (4) close with a final implication.

A short, safe structure you can follow (fill the brackets)
1) Restate the argument (1 sentence): “In sum, [paraphrase thesis].”  
2) Synthesize the points (1 sentence): “This occurs through [displacing routine jobs], [concentrating industry], and [reducing career diversity].”  
3) Policy/action recommendation (1 sentence): “To prevent these harms, governments/universities should [invest in retraining / strengthen labor protections / support non‑technical programs].”  
4) Final implication (optional, 1 short sentence): “Without action, [consequence].” or “Prompt policy responses are therefore essential.”

Very short phrase starters you can adapt
- “In sum, automation is likely to undermine global employment prospects by…”  
- “This happens through the displacement of routine, low‑skilled jobs, the concentration of production in automation‑intensive sectors, and a reduction in the diversity of career paths.”  
- “To address these challenges, governments should … and universities should …”  
- “If these measures are not taken, …”

Would you like to try rewriting the conclusion now using that frame? Paste your version and tell me whether you want “Ideas only” feedback or “Ideas + grammar.” If you prefer, I can also insert your new conclusion into the full essay once you finish.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:10:46.061Z

**You:** In sum, the shift will lead to displacement of low-skilled jobs, concentration of industry, and reduction of career diversity. To address this problem, government and universities should pay attention and help the people who hindered by the shift.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:15:33.144Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — you’ve captured the main ideas and moved toward a recommendation. A few quick, focused notes to strengthen this conclusion and then a short frame you can use to rewrite it.

What’s good
- You restate the main problems (job displacement, industry concentration, reduced career diversity).  
- You try to move to action (governments and universities should respond).

What to fix (very brief)
1. Grammar and clarity: fix phrases like “pay attention” and “help the people who hindered by the shift.” Be precise (who should do what for whom?).  
2. Restate the thesis in new words, not copy it exactly.  
3. Be specific in the recommendation: name the kinds of actions (retraining, labor protections, funding for non‑technical programs) rather than “pay attention.”  
4. End with a clear implication: what happens if no action is taken, or why action matters.

Short 3‑sentence frame to rewrite your conclusion (fill the brackets)
1) Restate the argument: “In sum, [paraphrase thesis: automation is likely to weaken global employment by …].”  
2) Synthesize the points: “This occurs through [displacement of routine jobs], [concentration in automation‑intensive sectors], and [a narrowing of career options].”  
3) Recommendation + implication: “To avoid these outcomes, governments should [invest in accessible retraining and social protections] and universities should [maintain support for non‑technical programs]; otherwise, [long‑term unemployment and greater inequality are likely].”

Very short sentence starters you can adapt
- “In sum, automation is likely to weaken global employment prospects by …”  
- “This happens through the displacement of routine jobs, the concentration of production in automation‑intensive sectors, and a reduction in the diversity of career paths.”  
- “To prevent these harms, governments should … and universities should …; without such measures, …”

Would you like to try rewriting the conclusion now using that frame? If so, paste your version and tell me whether you want “Ideas only” feedback or “Ideas + grammar” edits. If you want, I can then insert the revised conclusion into your full essay.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:15:55.060Z

**You:** Please give some suggestions on topics sentence of paragraph 3

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:23:58.204Z

**Assistant:** Great — here are several focused topic‑sentence options for paragraph 3 (the one about universities changing majors). I’ve kept them formal and tied each one to your thesis language so the paragraph will clearly support the point about narrowing career diversity / widening the skills gap.

Pick one to adapt, or use them as models to write your own. After you choose, tell me whether you want “Ideas only” feedback or “Ideas + grammar” help for the rest of the paragraph.

Topic‑sentence options (short, formal)
1) To adapt to the shift, universities may expand programs in automation technologies, which could reduce enrollment in other fields and narrow the diversity of the labor market.  
- Use if you want a clear cause → consequence sentence.

2) If universities prioritize automation‑focused majors, graduates in non‑technical disciplines may face fewer employment opportunities, contributing to a less diverse job market.  
- Good for a conditional structure that leads into consequences.

3) A reallocation of university resources toward engineering and computing risks marginalizing arts and humanities, thereby limiting graduates’ career options.  
- Emphasizes funding/faculty decisions as the mechanism.

4) Demand for automation skills may prompt institutions to offer more technical courses, reducing institutional support for non‑technical programs and shrinking career diversity.  
- Useful when you plan to explain institutional responses (courses, hiring, funding).

5) As universities shift toward automation‑oriented curricula, fewer students may graduate in non‑technical fields, weakening the variety of skills available in the labor force.  
- Focuses on the graduate/output side and links to the skills gap.

6) Universities’ expansion of automation programs could unintentionally widen the skills gap by producing an oversupply of specialists and too few broadly trained graduates.  
- Adds a nuance: too many specialists vs. generalists.

7) Prioritizing automation education risks creating a labor market concentrated in specialized technical roles while diminishing opportunities for those trained in other disciplines.  
- Good if you want a macro, policy‑oriented tone.

Quick guidance for what to write next (one-sentence plan)
- After your chosen topic sentence: 1) explain specifically what universities might do (expand majors, shift funding, hire staff), 2) give a concrete example or plausible scenario (e.g., enrollment shifts, program cuts), 3) explain the direct effect on graduates and the labor market, and 4) tie the paragraph back to your thesis (“Therefore… undermines global employment prospects”).

Your move
- Which option would you like to use or adapt? (Paste your adapted sentence if you want targeted feedback.)  
- Also say: “Ideas only” or “Ideas + grammar” for revising the supporting sentences in paragraph 3.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:24:16.943Z

**You:** I mean paragraph 3 not 4

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:24:51.289Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for clarifying. I understand you mean paragraph 3 (the paragraph about universities changing majors). Let’s confirm the plan and then revise that paragraph together.

Quick confirmation (reply yes/no)
- Target for this session: revise the topic sentence of paragraph 3 and then revise that paragraph’s supporting sentences so it clearly links to the thesis. Is that correct? (Reply “Yes” or change the target.)

Two quick choices for how I help next
- Do you want “Ideas only” feedback (focus on logic and connection to thesis), or “Ideas + grammar” (I will also correct grammar and wording in the paragraph)? Reply with your choice.

Before you try: three brief reminders for a strong topic sentence
1. Link it to the thesis (use language like “universities,” “automation programs,” “narrow the diversity of the labor market,” or “widen the skills gap”).  
2. Make one clear claim (what universities will do and why it matters).  
3. Keep it formal and grammatically correct (e.g., “To adapt to the shift, universities may expand programs in automation technologies, which could …”).

Your turn (short task)
- Please try rewriting the topic sentence for paragraph 3 — one short sentence is fine. Paste 1–2 versions here. I’ll give focused feedback and then we’ll revise the paragraph’s supporting sentences together.

If you prefer, I can show 2–3 model topic sentences first — say “Show models.”

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:25:08.782Z

**You:** In addition, the techological shift may lead to the technologies of automation become the major industries.  Topic sentence of paragraph three

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:25:51.774Z

**Assistant:** Good — you picked the right paragraph. Quick, focused feedback on your original sentence:

Problems to fix (brief)
- Grammar: use “adapt to the shift,” not “adapting” or “adapt the shift.”  
- Word order/clarity: “the technologies of automation become the major industries” is awkward and unclear.  
- Focus: the topic sentence should say what universities do and why that matters for the labor market (link it to your thesis about narrowed career diversity / skills gaps).

Try this next — don’t copy; fill one of these frames so the sentence is yours:

Frame A (cause → consequence)
“To adapt to the shift, universities may [expand/prioritize X], which could [marginalize Y / narrow Z].”

Frame B (conditional)
“If universities [reallocate/offer more X], then [consequence], [link to thesis].”

Frame C (risk statement)
“A shift in higher education toward [automation‑focused programs] risks [reducing enrollment in non‑technical fields / narrowing the diversity of the labor market].”

Quick phrase choices you can drop into the blanks
- X: “programs in automation technologies” / “automation‑focused majors” / “engineering and computing programs”  
- Y/Z/consequences: “marginalize arts and humanities,” “reduce enrollment in non‑technical fields,” “narrow the diversity of the labor market,” “widen the skills gap,” “limit graduates’ career options”  
- Link to thesis: “thereby narrowing graduates’ career options” / “thus undermining employment diversity”

Your turn (short task)
- Try 1–2 topic‑sentence versions using a frame above and paste them here.  
- Also tell me: do you want “Ideas only” feedback or “Ideas + grammar”?
