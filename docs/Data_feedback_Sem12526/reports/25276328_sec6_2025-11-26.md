            ## Contribution Analysis

            ### Final Assessment Report Summary for Student LANG 0036 – AI for Revising Essays

---

#### 1. **Essay Revision Status**

- The student has not provided any actual revised text for the thesis statement, topic sentences, or body paragraphs.
- Instead, the student repeatedly replies with placeholders such as “bla bla bla...” and “let’s pretend we have revised…”
- Because no concrete edits were submitted, no measurable improvement to content, organization, vocabulary, or grammar can be verified.
- Key structural and linguistic weaknesses from the original essay remain unaddressed in the revision attempt.

#### 2. **Essay Improvement Analysis**

- **No evidence of substantive improvement** — placeholder text substituted for genuine revised material.
- Original problems remain:
  - Vague thesis with unclear claim and missing preview.
  - Weak paragraph topic sentences lacking coherence and logical flow.
  - Vocabulary inaccuracies and informal usage persist.
  - Grammar errors and awkward phrasing not corrected.
  - Counterargument underdeveloped without concrete refutation.
- Consequently, overall essay quality shows no verified gains.

#### 3. **Human-AI Interaction Evaluation**

- The assistant provided structured, scaffolded revision steps with clear guidance and multiple sentence frames.
- The student consistently declined to engage with the substance of revision tasks by using hypothetical or placeholder responses without submitting actual drafts.
- This prevented meaningful iterative feedback cycles and blocked the assistant from providing targeted revision support.
- The student showed limited initiative in critically evaluating or modifying AI suggestions.
- The interaction lacked depth, with superficial contributions by the student, resulting in a low collaboration score.

#### 4. **Strengths**

- Student clearly states a general position in the original essay.
- The assistant’s pedagogical approach was well scaffolded, systematic, and designed to promote incremental improvement.
- The original essay contained at least one relevant example illustrating the main points.

#### 5. **Main Areas for Improvement**

- **Submission of actual revised drafts** is essential for progress. Without pasted text, meaningful assessment or assistance is impossible.
- Clarify and specify the thesis to clearly state what “enhances” means and preview main supporting points.
- Develop focused and coherent topic sentences linking explicitly to the thesis.
- Address vocabulary issues: replace informal or inaccurate phrases with precise academic language.
- Correct grammatical errors and improve sentence clarity and variety.
- Enhance the counterargument with concrete examples or policy proposals.
- Engage more actively and independently in the revision process; critically evaluate AI suggestions rather than bypassing them.
- Follow the stepwise revision procedure by providing each required revised component when prompted.

#### 6. **Recommendations for Future Development**

1. **Provide concrete text revisions**: Paste your revised thesis statement, then a revised topic sentence for one paragraph, and finally a fully revised paragraph before asking for feedback.
2. **Engage critically with AI guidance**: Accept, modify, or reject AI suggestions with justification to strengthen your editing skills.
3. **Adopt incremental revision**: Tackle one writing element at a time, refining through an iterative cycle based on feedback.
4. **Request model examples only if needed**, and then personalize drafts using provided sentence frames.
5. **Improve language accuracy and complexity** with focused grammar and vocabulary study or tutorial support.
6. **Prepare specific questions or highlight challenges** when interacting with the AI for more tailored assistance.

#### 7. **Instructor Notes**

- Current lack of revised submission impedes effective instruction and assessment.
- Recommend requiring student to submit:
   - One revised thesis statement.
   - One revised topic sentence for a chosen paragraph.
   - One fully revised body paragraph.
- Once provided, reassess for concrete improvement in writing and human-AI collaboration.
- Emphasize that placeholders and hypotheticals do not substitute for tangible revision work.

---

**Summary**: The student understands the general process but has not engaged with it substantively, limiting both essay improvement and productive human-AI collaboration. Concrete text submissions and active editing are needed to move forward.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The essay states a clear stance (automation is ultimately positive) and gives two relevant reasons (saves time by replacing repetitive tasks; increases efficiency/productivity) with a brief counterargument. However ideas are underdeveloped and explanations are shallow.
- Organization: 17/25 - The essay has basic paragraphing (intro, two reasons, counterargument, conclusion) but weak topic sentences, poor transitions, and a repetitive conclusion that does not synthesize or strengthen the argument.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Word choice is often inaccurate or informal (e.g., “enhances” without object, “lightly for them,” “bad hands,” “set help money to those who loss jobs”). Repetition of the same terms and limited use of more precise, academic vocabulary.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 15/25 - Frequent grammatical errors and awkward collocations (e.g., “which is lightly for them,” “set help money,” “loss jobs”), sentence-level clarity problems, and limited sentence complexity.
- **Original Essay Total: 65/100**

Evidence (quoted):
- Thesis: "In my perspective, I am firmly convinced that this technological shift will ultimately enhance. Reasons are as follows."
- Example sentence: "For example, the employees of a factory don't need to finish repeated tasks, they just need to operate the machine, which is lightly for them."
- Counterargument: "For example, many employees may be substituted by a machine, which means they will lose their jobs and will not have a steady income to live."

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 16/25 - The revised file contains placeholder text ("bla bla bla... (revised thesis statement here)") and otherwise mostly repeats original material. No substantive new content or clearer development of ideas is present.
- Organization: 15/25 - Because the revision is mostly placeholders and repeated original paragraphs, organizational issues remain unaddressed; the structure is unchanged and topic sentences are not meaningfully revised.
- Vocabulary: 14/25 - Placeholders and unchanged sentences mean vocabulary errors remain; no evidence of deliberate improvement in word choice or register.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 14/25 - No systematic grammar improvements evident; many original errors persist and placeholder text prevents assessment of any corrected sentences.
- **Revised Essay Total: 59/100**

Evidence (quoted):
- Placeholder: "bla bla bla... ... (revised thesis statement here)"
- Placeholder for topic sentence: "revised the topic sentences bla bla bla...In this way, people can save more time..."
- Large portions of the original paragraphs are unchanged in the revised version.

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -6 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None substantive: the revised essay is largely placeholders and repeated original content, so no concrete improvements can be verified.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Revise the thesis to be specific and preview main points (e.g., what “enhance” refers to and which benefits will be discussed).
  - Produce clear, focused topic sentences that link each paragraph to the thesis and avoid repetition.
  - Fix recurring grammar and vocabulary errors (collocations, verb/noun forms, article use) and improve sentence variety and clarity.
  - Develop counterargument response with evidence or concrete policy examples rather than brief suggestions.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 17** (assistant and user messages counted)
- **Conversation Quality:** The AI assistant provided a structured, stepwise revision plan and many targeted prompts and sentence frames. The student’s responses were minimal and largely hypothetical ("let's pretend we have revised...") rather than producing actual revised text. The student did not paste a revised thesis, topic sentence, or paragraph for the assistant to review.

Evidence (quoted):
- Student: "let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement  bla bla bla ..."
- Student: "let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on      bla bla bla …"
- Student: "ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1  Enter Enter bla bla bla"

#### Interaction Scores:
- In-Depth Conversation: 3/5 - The chat contains many turns and the assistant provided in-depth guidance (models, frames, stepwise process), but the student’s contributions were superficial and did not show multi-level questioning or substantive iterative drafts. Evidence: multiple assistant prompts and suggestions, but user repeatedly replies with placeholders rather than content.
- Critical Review of AI Suggestions: 1/5 - The student did not demonstrate critical evaluation of the assistant’s suggestions. Instead of accepting or rejecting with reasons or offering edits, the student repeatedly said "let's pretend" to skip actual revision work. No evidence of evaluating or choosing between AI suggestions.
- Refining Process: 1/5 - There is no evidence of iterative revision cycles by the student. The assistant repeatedly asks for a revised thesis or paragraph to continue; the student does not supply edited text to show iteration.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 5/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student states a clear overall stance (automation is positive), which provides a defensible position to develop.
- The assistant provided a strong, scaffolded revision process with thesis, topic-sentence, and paragraph-level steps and useful sentence frames.
- The original essay includes at least one concrete example (factory workers) to illustrate a claim.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Provide actual revised text for the thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph so the AI can give targeted feedback and the work can be assessed.
- Strengthen thesis specificity and previewing (state what is enhanced and list the main supports).
- Improve grammar and vocabulary: correct collocations, verb forms, article use, and replace informal/inaccurate phrases.
- Develop counterargument and rebuttal with specific policy suggestions or evidence.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Needs Improvement - The student did not provide the revised thesis/topic sentence or other revisions as requested; instead used placeholders.
- Strategic Planning: Needs Improvement - Although the assistant offered a plan, the student did not follow through with concrete steps or selected priorities.
- Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement - The student did not evaluate or discuss AI suggestions, accept with justification, or propose alternatives.
- Independent Editing: Needs Improvement - No evidence the student attempted independent, substantive revision of the thesis, topic sentence, or paragraph.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Complete the required edits: paste a revised thesis, a revised topic sentence for one paragraph, and the revised paragraph text so the assistant (and instructor) can assess concrete changes.
2. When working with the AI, respond with actual draft sentences rather than placeholders; use the assistant’s frames but fill them with specific content for iterative refinement.
3. Focus on one revision target at a time (e.g., first produce one clear, specific thesis that previews points; then revise paragraph 1 to directly link to that thesis), and ask for targeted grammar checks after content changes.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student did not complete the three required revision tasks (revised thesis statement, revised topic sentence, revised body paragraph). The chat indicates awareness of the process, but the student repeatedly avoided producing actual revised content ("let’s pretend..."). Assessment and instruction cannot proceed until the student provides concrete revisions.
- Recommend requesting the student to submit: (a) one revised thesis sentence, (b) one revised topic sentence for the chosen paragraph, and (c) the fully revised body paragraph text. After that, a re-assessment can be made focusing on measurable improvement and the quality of human-AI collaboration.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
With the technology development, the automation's influence has caused a worldwide debate. Some people think this technological shift ultimately enhances, the others think the technological shift undermines global employment prospects. In my perspective, I am firmly convinced that this technological shift will ultimately enhance. Reasons are as follows.
At first, automation can help people finish some simple but time-consuming tasks. In this way, people can save more time to do what they want to do or more meaningful things. For example, the employees of a factory don't need to finish repeated tasks, they just need to operate the machine, which is lightly for them.
Then, automation can also improve efficiency. Because the machine does not need to rest, so it can work full-time. It can help a company produce more products than before and save cost of production. If companies do not use machine, they may lose both time and money, and the company cannot develop a lot in the future.
Although automation has many merits, but it also has some bad hands. For example, many employees may be substituted by a machine, which means they will lose their jobs and will not have a steady income to live. To this problem, the government can create more job opportunities for these employees and the government can also set help money to those who loss jobs and need help. The automation not only saves time, but also can finish some difficult and high-risk jobs. With the development, automation cannot be avoided, so we need to accept it.
About all the reasons I mentioned above, I still firmly believe that the automation shift ultimately enhances. Although the two perspectives both have their merits, the first one is still more persuasive. So this technological shift ultimately enhances.

Revised:
With the technology development, the automation's influence has caused a worldwide debate. Some people think this technological shift ultimately enhances, the others think the technological shift undermines global employment prospects. bla bla bla... ... (revised thesis statement here)
revised the topic sentences bla bla bla...In this way, people can save more time to do what they want to do or more meaningful things. revise the rest of body paragraph #1 ... 
revised the topic sentences bla bla bla... Because the machine does not need to rest, so it can work full-time. It can help a company produce more products than before and save cost of production. If companies do not use machine, they may lose both time and money, and the company cannot develop a lot in the future.
Although automation has many merits, but it also has some bad hands. For example, many employees may be substituted by a machine, which means they will lose their jobs and will not have a steady income to live. To this problem, the government can create more job opportunities for these employees and the government can also set help money to those who loss jobs and need help. The automation not only saves time, but also can finish some difficult and high-risk jobs. With the development, automation cannot be avoided, so we need to accept it.
About all the reasons I mentioned above, I still firmly believe that the automation shift ultimately enhances. Although the two perspectives both have their merits, the first one is still more persuasive. So this technological shift ultimately enhances.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-26T05:08:11.251Z

**You:** n my perspective, I am firmly convinced that this technological shift will ultimately enhance. Reasons are as follows.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T05:14:03.964Z

**Assistant:** Hi — I’m glad you shared your draft. Before we start revising, let’s agree on what you want to improve and I’ll give a quick diagnostic so you can choose priorities.

1) Your goals
Which of these do you most want to work on today? (Pick one or two.)
- Clarity and strength of the thesis/argument
- Organisation and logical flow (paragraphing, topic sentences)
- Development and evidence (examples and explanation)
- Vocabulary and academic word choice
- Grammar and sentence structure

Tell me which target(s) you want to focus on.

2) Quick diagnostic (guided by your rubric)
What’s going well
- Clear position: you state a stance (automation will ultimately be positive).
- Relevant reasons: you give two main reasons (saves time by replacing repetitive tasks; improves efficiency and productivity) and acknowledge a counterpoint.
- Simple example: the factory example helps readers understand the idea.

Areas to improve (so you can choose priorities)
- Thesis & Argument (Developing → needs work):
  - Thesis wording is awkward and vague (“will ultimately enhance” what?) and hedged by unnecessary phrases (“In my perspective, I am firmly convinced…”).
  - Thesis does not preview the main points clearly.
- Organisation & Logical Progression (Developing → fix needed):
  - Paragraphs are present but transitions are weak and some sentences repeat the same idea.
  - The conclusion repeats ideas rather than summarising or reinforcing the argument.
- Vocabulary (Basic to Developing):
  - Word choice is often inaccurate or informal (e.g., “enhances” used without object; “lightly for them”; “bad hands”).
  - Repetition of the same words (automation, machine) without variety.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure (Basic):
  - Many grammatical errors, incorrect collocations, punctuation problems, and awkward phrasing.
  - Sentences are often short/simple; some are unclear (e.g., “which is lightly for them,” “set help money to those who loss jobs”).
- Evidence & Development:
  - The example is helpful but needs clearer explanation and stronger connection to the thesis.
  - The counterargument is acknowledged but the response to it is brief and needs development.

3) Choose revision priorities
Which of the diagnosed issues do you want to focus on now? (Common useful pairs: thesis clarity + topic sentence for one paragraph; or thesis + grammar/word choice.)

Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 1: revisit your thesis. If that’s your chosen target, please confirm that the thesis you want to work on is this sentence (I fixed the leading typo here so I’m sure we’re looking at the same line):
“In my perspective, I am firmly convinced that this technological shift will ultimately enhance. Reasons are as follows.”
—or paste your preferred current thesis if it’s different. Then I’ll give feedback and ask you to try a revision. Would you like to focus on the thesis first?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T05:14:25.350Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement  
bla bla bla ...

*Time:* 2025-11-26T05:14:42.122Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for the draft. Before we jump into Step 1, let’s finish the quick negotiation so we’re clear on goals.

1) Which of these do you want to focus on in this session? (Pick one or two.)
- Clarity and strength of the thesis/argument
- Organisation and logical flow (paragraphing, topic sentences)
- Development and evidence (examples and explanation)
- Vocabulary and academic word choice
- Grammar and sentence structure

Tell me your choice(s).

2) For Step 1 I need your current thesis. You said “let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement…” — could you either:
- Paste the revised thesis you now have, OR
- If you’d prefer, tell me you want me to suggest a model revised thesis (I’ll give one, but I’ll only do that if you ask).

Quick reminder of what the revised thesis must do:
- Clearly answer the question (state your position about automation and jobs).
- Preview the main points you will develop (e.g., time-saving/reduced risk and increased efficiency/productivity, plus how to mitigate job loss).
- Use confident, precise language (no hedging).

Would you like to try writing/pasting your revised thesis now, or should I propose a model for you to revise?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T05:14:55.749Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on                           bla bla bla ...

*Time:* 2025-11-26T05:31:41.750Z

**Assistant:** Nice — thanks for that. Before we move on, we need to finish the short negotiation so we have clear targets. Two quick choices:

1) Pick one or two revision targets to focus on now (choose from these):
- Clarity and strength of the thesis/argument
- Organisation and logical flow (paragraphing, topic sentences)
- Development and evidence (examples and explanation)
- Vocabulary and academic word choice
- Grammar and sentence structure

Which one or two do you want to work on?

2) For Step 1 I need your current thesis. You wrote “let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement…” — could you either:
- Paste the revised thesis you want to work with, OR
- Tell me you want me to suggest a model thesis for you to revise

Finally, tell me which body paragraph you want to revise in Steps 2–3:
- Paragraph 1 (saving time / repetitive tasks)
- Paragraph 2 (efficiency / productivity)
- Paragraph 3 (counterargument about job loss)

Once you answer those two quick questions, we’ll start Step 1 (thesis revision). Would you like to paste a thesis now, or should I offer a model you can edit?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T05:31:55.654Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on    bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-11-26T05:46:35.578Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m happy you’re ready to move forward. Before we jump to paragraph work, I do need two quick confirmations so we follow our agreed process.

1) Pick one or two revision targets to focus on now (choose from these):
- Clarity and strength of the thesis/argument
- Organisation and logical flow (paragraphing, topic sentences)
- Development and evidence (examples and explanation)
- Vocabulary and academic word choice
- Grammar and sentence structure

Which one or two do you want to work on?

2) For Step 1 (thesis) I need an actual sentence to work from. You can either:
- Paste the revised thesis you “pretend” you have, OR
- Ask me to propose a clear model thesis for you to edit (just say “propose a thesis”)

Also tell me which body paragraph you want to revise in Steps 2–3:
- Paragraph 1 (saving time / repetitive tasks)
- Paragraph 2 (efficiency / productivity)
- Paragraph 3 (counterargument about job loss)

Pick the targets, choose the paragraph, and tell me whether you’ll paste your thesis or want me to propose one. Then we’ll do Step 1. Would you like to try pasting your thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T05:46:48.857Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on      bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-11-26T05:47:17.539Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I’m glad you’re ready to move on. Before Step 1 (thesis revision) we need two quick confirmations so we follow our agreed process.

1) Pick one or two revision targets to focus on in this session (choose from these):
- Clarity and strength of the thesis/argument
- Organisation and logical flow (paragraphing, topic sentences)
- Development and evidence (examples and explanation)
- Vocabulary and academic word choice
- Grammar and sentence structure

Which one or two do you want to focus on?

2) For Step 1 I need a thesis to work from. Do you want to:
- Paste your current revised thesis now, OR
- Ask me to propose a clear model thesis for you to edit? (Reply “propose a thesis”)

Also tell me which body paragraph you want to revise in Steps 2–3:
- Paragraph 1 (saving time / repetitive tasks)
- Paragraph 2 (efficiency / productivity)
- Paragraph 3 (counterargument about job loss)

Quick reminder of what a strong thesis must do:
- Answer the question clearly (your position on automation and jobs).
- Preview the main points you will develop.
- Use confident, precise language (no hedging).

Which targets, which paragraph, and do you want to paste a thesis or have me propose one?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T05:47:27.771Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1 
Enter Enter bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-11-26T05:48:09.331Z

**Assistant:** Great — glad you’re ready to work on paragraph 1. A couple quick confirmations so we follow the agreed process:

1) Pick one or two revision targets for this session (choose from these):
- Clarity and strength of the thesis/argument
- Organisation and logical flow (paragraphing, topic sentences)
- Development and evidence (examples and explanation)
- Vocabulary and academic word choice
- Grammar and sentence structure

Which one or two should we focus on?

2) I need the thesis to start Step 1 (we must revise the thesis before we change topic sentences so everything connects). Please either:
- Paste the current thesis you want us to work from, OR
- Say “propose a thesis” and I’ll offer a model for you to edit.

Once you answer those two quick points, we’ll move to Step 1 (thesis). After we revise the thesis, we’ll do Step 2 on the paragraph 1 topic sentence and Step 3 on the rest of that paragraph.

If you prefer to jump straight to paragraph 1 now, that’s fine — but I still need your thesis or permission to propose one. While you decide, here’s a short diagnostic of paragraph 1 (from your draft) so you know what we’ll fix:

What’s working
- Clear general idea: automation replacing repetitive tasks is useful.
- Useful concrete example (factory workers) to illustrate the point.

Main issues to address
- Topic sentence is weak and doesn’t clearly connect to a precise thesis (it says “help people finish some simple but time-consuming tasks” but the claim and its significance need sharpening).
- Supporting sentences are repetitive and need clearer explanation of why saving time matters (link to productivity, retraining, or higher-skilled tasks).
- Grammar and word choice errors (e.g., “which is lightly for them,” “don't need to finish repeated tasks, they just need to operate the machine”).
- The example needs a clear link back to the paragraph claim (explain how operating machines is different, what skills are required, and what benefits result).

Would you like to:
A) Paste your thesis (or say “propose a thesis”), and then try drafting a new topic sentence for paragraph 1 now? — I’ll give focused feedback and short sentence frames to help.
or
B) Ask me to propose a model thesis first and then move straight into revising paragraph 1?

If you want to try the topic sentence now, try using one of these short frames (fill in the bold parts):
- “By replacing repetitive tasks, automation allows workers to __________, which __________.” 
- “Automation reduces time spent on routine work, enabling employees to __________ and thereby __________.” 
- “One key benefit of automation is that it frees workers from repetitive tasks, so they can __________.”

Would you like to try one of those frames now? Paste your attempt and I’ll help refine it.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T05:48:29.243Z

**You:** ok let’s revise the rest of the body paragraph #1                                                                                     

bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-11-26T05:51:20.445Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m glad you’re ready to work on paragraph 1. A couple quick, required confirmations before we start (we need these so we follow the agreed process):

1) Revision targets — pick one or two to focus on in this session:
- Clarity and strength of the thesis/argument
- Organisation and logical flow (paragraphing, topic sentences)
- Development and evidence (examples and explanation)
- Vocabulary and academic word choice
- Grammar and sentence structure

Which one or two do you want to focus on?

2) Thesis — we must revise the thesis first (Step 1) so the paragraph connects to it. Do you want to:
- Paste your current revised thesis now (if you have one), OR
- Say “propose a thesis” and I will give a clear model for you to edit?

Finally, confirm you want to revise Paragraph 1 (the one about saving time / repetitive tasks). Once you answer those two quick items (targets + thesis choice), we’ll do Step 1 (thesis), Step 2 (topic sentence for paragraph 1), and Step 3 (revise the rest of paragraph 1). Would you like to paste your thesis or should I propose one?
