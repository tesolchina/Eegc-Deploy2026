            ## Contribution Analysis

            Based on the training assessment report and chat history, here is a tailored plan to support the student’s progress and AI collaboration skills going forward:

---

**Summary of Key Issues Observed**  
- No student reply or engagement with AI prompts in the chat history.  
- Revised essay is identical to the original, indicating no actual revision took place.  
- Major missed opportunities: clear, specific thesis statement; elaborated examples; grammar corrections; active human-AI interaction.  
- Low scores in human-AI collaboration categories reflecting minimal interaction and iterative development.

---

**Recommended Next Steps for the Student**

1. **Acknowledge AI Prompts and Engage Actively**  
   - Always respond to AI questions or instructions to confirm understanding (e.g., identify the thesis sentence number).  
   - State your intended revision plan before making changes to help the AI understand your goals.

2. **Revise the Thesis Statement Explicitly**  
   - Combine the two main points into a concise, testable thesis sentence.  
   - Share your revised thesis with the AI and request alternative phrasings or feedback.  
   - Example: “I believe citizens can fight climate change mainly by pressuring governments to pass environmental laws and by adopting sustainable lifestyle changes that influence market demand.”

3. **Focus on One Improvement at a Time**  
   - Revise one paragraph’s topic sentence, add specific evidence or data, and fix grammar in a draft.  
   - Submit this partial revision for AI feedback rather than revising the whole essay at once.

4. **Iterative Revision Cycles**  
   - Incorporate AI suggestions, question unclear advice, and decide which edits to accept with justification.  
   - Produce at least 2-3 rounds of revision per essay to deepen understanding and improve quality.

5. **Improve Grammar and Style**  
   - Request the AI to highlight all grammar errors and explain corrections.  
   - Try rewriting sentences using AI suggestions to enhance clarity and variety.

6. **Use Concrete Examples and Terminology**  
   - Add named policies (e.g., “Paris Agreement,” “carbon taxes”) or statistics to support arguments.  
   - Include topic-specific vocabulary such as “renewable energy targets,” “policy instruments,” or “consumer behavior.”

---

**Instructor’s Suggested Follow-Up Actions**  
- Check with the student whether they encountered technical or engagement issues preventing AI interaction.  
- Encourage synchronous sessions or monitored exercises to train iterative human-AI interaction skills.  
- Set specific milestones requiring active AI dialogue and documented reasoning for revisions.

---

**Example Conversation Starter to Re-Engage the Student**

“Hi [Student], I noticed you haven’t responded to the AI assistant’s prompt about locating and revising your thesis statement. Could you please identify the thesis sentence in your draft and share how you plan to revise it? Together, we can craft a clearer thesis that previews your main points and strengthens your essay.”

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The essay has a clear position (partly agree) and two identifiable lines of argument (influencing government; personal lifestyle choices). Ideas are relevant to climate change but development is general and lacks specific data or precise examples. Evidence: “The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government…” and “individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling…”
- Organization: 21/25 - Clear basic structure (intro, two body paragraphs, conclusion) and logical progression from one main point to the next. Transitions and paragraph unity are adequate but sometimes repetitive and underdeveloped (some sentences repeat earlier points instead of deepening them).
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Adequate everyday vocabulary for expressing ideas about climate action, but limited range and occasional awkward word choices (“normal people”, “maybe just listen a little”). Could use more topic-specific terms (e.g., “carbon pricing”, “renewable portfolio”, “policy instruments”).
- Grammar: 15/25 - Frequent grammar and phrasing errors that occasionally affect clarity (e.g., “But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action,” “nothing happen.”). Sentence variety is limited and some sentences show incorrect tense/subject-verb agreement or missing articles.
- **Original Essay Total: 75/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised essay is identical in content to the original: same thesis, same two main points, and same level of development. No additional evidence or detail was added.
- Organization: 21/25 - Structure remains the same and still coherent, but no organizational improvements are evident.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - No change from the original; vocabulary still simple and sometimes imprecise.
- Grammar: 15/25 - No grammatical corrections were made; the same errors remain.
- **Revised Essay Total: 75/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None — the revised essay is the same as the original; no substantive revisions to thesis, topic sentences, body paragraphs, vocabulary, or grammar were made.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Revise the thesis to explicitly state the two main points in a concise, testable way (e.g., “Citizens can meaningfully address climate change by pressuring governments to adopt policies and by adopting collective lifestyle changes that influence markets.”).
  - Strengthen topic sentences to preview the paragraph argument and link to the thesis (e.g., “First, civic pressure can compel governments to implement policy tools such as carbon pricing or renewable energy targets.”).
  - Provide more specific, credible evidence (names of policies, brief data, or documented case studies) and improve grammar and sentence variety.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 1**
- **Conversation Quality:** Extremely limited. The only recorded message is from the AI assistant giving an instruction to revise the thesis statement and asking the student to locate it. There are no student responses or follow-up exchanges.

Evidence: Assistant message — “Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question. Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?”

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 1/5 - The chat history contains only one assistant message and no student replies, so there is no extended back-and-forth or multi-level questioning. (Evidence: single chat entry with no student responses.)
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 - There is no evidence the student evaluated, accepted, or rejected AI suggestions; no critique or commentary appears in the chat.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 - No iterative revision cycles are evident in the chat or the revised essay; the revised essay is unchanged from the original, so no refinements based on AI feedback occurred.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 3/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear overall stance: The essay communicates a balanced viewpoint (partly agree) and identifies two relevant mechanisms for individual influence: political pressure and lifestyle choices. Evidence: opening sentence and concluding line: “I partly agree… citizens can still influence the government… personal green lifestyle choices… still have a role to play.”
- Basic essay structure: The student organizes material into introduction, body, and conclusion, which supports readability.
- Relevant, relatable examples: Mentions protests, voting, and consumer choices as mechanisms—these are appropriate examples for the audience.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Thesis clarity and specificity: Make the thesis explicit about the two main points and their relationship to the claim. Recommendation: rewrite the thesis as a single sentence that previews the two main supporting points.
- Engagement with the AI assistant: The student did not respond to the AI prompt or implement suggested revisions; active interaction is needed to benefit from AI support.
- Grammar and precision: Correct recurring errors (subject-verb agreement, missing articles, awkward phrasing) and increase sentence variety. Recommendation: run focused grammar revision and proofreading.
- Use of evidence and development: Add concrete examples, brief data/statistics, or named policy cases to strengthen claims (e.g., cite a country’s plastic ban or a city's emissions policy).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The chat history shows no student input to provide goals, constraints, or intended audience; the student did not respond to the assistant’s prompt.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - No evidence the student planned or negotiated revision goals with the AI (no iterative plan or requested strategies).
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - No critical responses or selective acceptance/rejection of AI suggestions are present.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The revised essay is unchanged; the student did not demonstrate independent application of suggested edits.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Respond to the AI assistant’s prompts promptly and explicitly. For example, when asked to “locate the thesis,” reply with the sentence number and state how you will revise it.
2. Revise the thesis into one clear sentence that names both supporting points; then ask the AI for alternative phrasings and choose one, explaining your choice.
3. Implement targeted edits to one paragraph at a time: revise a topic sentence, add a concrete example or statistic, and fix grammar. Ask the AI for specific suggestions (e.g., “Make this sentence more formal” or “Add one concrete example with a citation”).
4. Use an iterative workflow: propose a revision, get feedback, accept or reject specific changes with reasons, and produce a next draft. Aim for at least 3 meaningful revision cycles.
5. Run grammar checks or ask the AI to highlight and correct grammatical errors and explain the corrections to learn from them.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student did not engage in the AI-assisted revision process despite an explicit AI prompt to revise the thesis. The “revised” essay is identical to the original, and the chat shows no student messages. This suggests either the student did not submit the actual revised version or there was an interruption in the interaction. Please follow up with the student to confirm whether they attempted revisions offline or encountered technical/participation issues.
- Recommend requiring at least one synchronous or more interactive exchange in future assignments to ensure students actively practice critical evaluation and iterative revision with AI.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.
