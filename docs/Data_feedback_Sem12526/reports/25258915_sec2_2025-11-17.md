# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

---

## Training Progress Status

**Based on the instructions, the student was required to:**
1. Revise the thesis statement
2. Revise one of the topic sentences
3. Revise one body paragraph

**Progress Review:**

- **Thesis Statement Revision:** The student and AI worked extensively to revise the thesis, moving from a less focused statement to a much more nuanced and academically precise version.
- **Topic Sentence Revision:** The topic sentence for the body paragraph on personal green choices was discussed, with several suggestions and a final revised version integrating feedback and aligning with the thesis.
- **Body Paragraph Revision:** While the student did provide a revised version of the entire essay, the record shows that step 3 (body paragraph content revision) was begun, but the specific, guided revision process for improving supporting sentences and explanations in a chosen body paragraph was *not fully completed or independently confirmed*. The AI provided targeted prompts and guidance for further revision, but the student did not submit an explicit, revised sentence from the paragraph in direct response to the last prompt.

**Therefore:** According to the assignment instructions *all three steps must be completed with evidence of each revision*. The third step (body paragraph revision) remains incomplete in a direct, process-oriented format.

**STATUS:** **not finished**

---

## AI Collaboration Progress (Detailed Feedback)

**Strengths:**
- The student engaged in multiple rounds of revision with the AI, showing a positive attitude and willingness to improve.
- The student responded to prompts for thesis and topic sentence improvement, demonstrating openness to feedback and an emerging understanding of academic writing structure.
- The student asked for clarifications about rubric expectations and passing criteria, which is a sign of reflective learning.

**AI Collaboration Skills:**
- **Context Provision:** Student provided context about their draft and responded to rubric feedback, but sometimes skipped steps or summary requests from AI (Needs Improvement).
- **Strategic Planning:** Followed most steps in sequence, but did not always specify which sentences to revise, especially in the body paragraph stage (Developing).
- **Critical Evaluation:** The student considered AI suggestions, but did not push back or critically analyze alternatives in detail (Needs Improvement).
- **Independent Editing:** The student made substantial independent edits to thesis and paragraph topic sentences, but relied heavily on AI for structure and direction (Good).

---

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Essay Revision Skills:**  
   - Complete all steps in the revision sequence, including explicit revision of supporting sentences in a body paragraph and reflecting on why changes were made.
   - Provide concrete examples during revision (e.g., rewrite one or two sentences per body paragraph based on feedback) to ensure understanding.

2. **AI Collaboration Skills:**  
   - Continue to ask questions about rubric criteria and assessment standards.
   - When prompted by AI to choose or revise specific sentences, respond directly and specifically to maximize individualized feedback.

3. **Overall Improvement:**  
   - Check each step of the assignment before submitting, ensuring every revision task has been completed with clear evidence.
   - Use AI feedback to develop deeper critical thinking about your own writing choices, including exploring multiple alternatives when revising.

---

## INSTRUCTOR NOTES

- The student has shown encouraging engagement and a willingness to apply feedback, especially in revising thesis and topic statements.
- To finish the module tasks, the student should submit clear evidence of revision to a full body paragraph, including improved unity, clarity, and depth of explanation, as prompted by the AI.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. While I acknowledge that government and corporate actions are more impactful in driving large-scale climate solutions, I firmly believe individual citizens play an indispensable role by influencing policy decisions through collective advocacy and adopting sustainable daily lifestyles—making their contributions far from negligible.
One impactful way individuals can drive climate progress is by influencing governments and politicians through coordinated collective action. When large groups of citizens unite to demand stronger environmental laws, governments face tangible public pressure that makes meaningful action more likely. For example, peaceful protests against fossil fuel projects or grassroots campaigns to elect leaders who prioritize climate action have pushed governments to impose stricter pollution regulations and allocate more funding to renewable energy projects. In countries like Germany and Canada, citizens have successfully pressured policymakers to introduce stricter plastic bans and ambitious carbon emission reduction targets. This demonstrates that collective public opinion can be a powerful catalyst for policy change, even if individual voices alone carry less weight. However, collective advocacy sometimes fails because marginalized communities often lack equal access to decision-making channels, and governments may prioritize short-term economic interests over long-term environmental protection. To overcome these barriers, community organizations can provide resources and training to help individuals effectively voice their concerns, such as hosting workshops on how to engage with local representatives.
In addition to shaping political outcomes through collective advocacy, individuals contribute to climate action by making meaningful, consistent changes in their daily lives. While not as transformative as government policies, these personal adjustments can collectively support climate efforts through reducing individual carbon footprints and shaping broader societal norms. Examples include practicing regular recycling, conserving water through low-flow fixtures, or choosing active transportation like walking or cycling instead of driving. Though such lifestyle changes may seem minor on an individual level, widespread adoption can influence both societal expectations and business practices in impactful ways. If many people commit to sustainable living, it creates a ripple effect—encouraging friends, family, and neighbors to follow suit—and sends a clear market signal to companies that consumers are prioritizing eco-friendly products and services. For instance, when a growing number of shoppers choose brands with minimal plastic packaging or ethical sourcing practices, businesses are incentivized to adopt more sustainable operations to remain competitive and profitable. That said, a major barrier to widespread adoption of green lifestyles is the lack of accessible, affordable sustainable options—such as limited public transportation in rural areas or higher prices for eco-friendly products. Addressing this requires individuals to advocate for systemic changes (like improved public transit) while making small, feasible adjustments to their own habits, even if perfect sustainability feels out of reach.
In conclusion, while individual actions alone cannot solve climate change—and government and corporate leadership remains critical—they are far from insignificant. The most valuable contribution individuals can make is driving policy change through collective advocacy, as this empowers systemic solutions that scale beyond personal habits. At the same time, consistent personal sustainable choices help build a culture of environmental responsibility and hold businesses accountable. In my opinion, governments, companies, and individuals must collaborate closely to combat this pressing global problem—with individuals using their voices and daily choices to push for the large-scale changes our planet urgently needs.

*Time:* 2025-11-17T05:00:20.781Z

**You:** Revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-17T05:08:11.309Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your draft! Let’s start by looking at your thesis statement. Here’s what you currently have (from your final draft):

> “While government and corporate actions are crucial in tackling climate change, individual citizens play an essential role by influencing policy decisions through collective advocacy and adopting sustainable daily lifestyles.”

**Feedback:**
- **Clarity:** Your thesis is clear but could be more direct in stating your stance. Remember, your thesis should clearly answer the question about the importance of individual action vs. governments/companies.
- **Strength & Focus:** Good job mentioning both collective advocacy and lifestyle changes! However, “essential role” is a fairly general phrase—can you be even more specific about *how much* individuals matter? Do you mostly agree, partly agree, or mostly disagree with the viewpoint?
- **Preview of Main Points:** It’s good that you mention influencing policy and personal lifestyles. Is it clear which, if any, you believe is more important?
- **Confident & Precise Language:** Try to avoid hedging or overly general phrases.

**Prompt for Revision:**
Can you try rewriting your thesis so that it:
- Clearly states your answer (How important is individual action compared to government/corporate action?)
- Previews your two main supporting ideas (influence on government, personal green choices)
- Uses strong, decisive language

Let’s get started—please paste your revised thesis statement now!

*Time:* 2025-11-17T05:08:59.484Z

**You:** Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. While government and corporate actions are crucial in tackling climate change, individual citizens play an essential role by influencing policy decisions through collective advocacy and adopting sustainable daily lifestyles.
One impactful way individuals can contribute to fighting climate change is by influencing governments and politicians through collective action. When large groups of citizens demand stronger environmental laws, governments are far more likely to take tangible action. For example, if people organize peaceful protests or vote for leaders who prioritize environmental protection, it can push the government to impose stricter pollution bans or invest more heavily in clean energy infrastructure. In some countries, citizens have united to pressure their leaders into introducing new regulations on plastic usage or carbon emission reductions. This demonstrates that public opinion and collective pressure from ordinary people can have a significant impact, even if individual voices alone carry less weight. However, governments may sometimes only respond superficially rather than taking robust action, so this approach is not always fully effective. Additionally, some people wish for environmental change but lack clear channels to communicate their concerns to politicians, resulting in little progress.
On the other hand, individuals can also make meaningful small changes in their daily lives, such as recycling regularly, conserving water, or choosing to walk or cycle instead of driving. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still hold value in addressing climate change. If many people commit to living more sustainably, it can set a positive example for others and send a clear signal to companies that consumers are seeking eco-friendly products. For instance, if a large number of people choose to buy from environmentally responsible companies, businesses will be incentivized to adopt more sustainable practices to maintain profitability. That said, some people prioritize convenience over sustainability and are unwilling to change their habits, which poses a challenge. Furthermore, if only a small minority of people adopt green lifestyles while most others do not, the overall impact on climate change will be limited.
In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are far from useless. The most important contribution individuals can make is influencing governments to implement strong, effective environmental decisions. At the same time, personal green habits can also provide valuable support, even if their impact is more modest. In my opinion, governments, companies, and individuals all need to work together collaboratively to combat this pressing global problem. I revise the article ,how about this one ?I want to know if I fit the advice you gave me just now?

*Time:* 2025-11-17T05:10:47.920Z

**Assistant:** Thank you so much for sharing your revised thesis and letting me know your thoughts! I appreciate your careful work. Let’s take a close look at your thesis now:

**Your current thesis:**
> “While government and corporate actions are crucial in tackling climate change, individual citizens play an essential role by influencing policy decisions through collective advocacy and adopting sustainable daily lifestyles.”

**Let’s review step-by-step according to the advice:**

**1. Clarity & Answering the Question:**
- You are clearly stating that you agree government and corporate actions are very important.
- You highlight that individuals also play an “essential role.”
- *However,* the essay question is really asking: Are individual actions LESS important than those of governments and companies? Right now, your thesis says both are important, but doesn’t quite show your viewpoint on which matters more.

**2. Preview Main Points:**
- Good job showing your two main points: individuals influencing policy, and personal sustainable choices.

**3. Confident, Precise Language:**
- The phrase “an essential role” is strong, but can you be more precise about your stance? For example, do you partly agree individuals matter less, or do you think both are equally crucial?

**Your thesis would be even stronger if you:**
- Make your viewpoint more explicit (for example: “Although government and corporate actions have the greatest impact, individuals are still important because…” OR “While governments and corporations play the leading role, individuals also make meaningful contributions…”)
- Preview that influencing government is the *most important* way individuals matter, then mention lifestyle choices as supporting point.

---

**Suggestions for Revision:**  
Would you like to try a new version that…
- Clearly states *how* important individual actions are compared to those of governments and companies?
- Previews both main points in a more structured way?

**Here are a few prompts to help you:**
- “Although the actions of governments and companies are most effective in fighting climate change, individuals can make a significant difference, mainly by influencing policy and also by adopting green habits.”
or
- “While combating climate change depends mostly on strong government and corporate action, individuals can have a real impact through collective advocacy and personal lifestyle choices.”

**Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now, so it fully fits the advice?**  
(Type your improved thesis and let me know if you’re satisfied with it! I’ll review and then help you move to topic sentence revision.)

---

**To answer your question directly:**  
You’re already very close to meeting my advice, and it’s a solid thesis!  
Just make sure you answer *how much* individual actions matter compared to governments/companies, and that your position is crystal clear.

Would you like to try one more revision?

*Time:* 2025-11-17T05:14:10.458Z

**Assistant:** Great question! Let’s look at your essay in relation to your course rubric and requirements. I’ll give you an honest, supportive evaluation so you know your strengths and what might need more revision.

---

## **Rubric Analysis:**
Let’s go section by section:

### **1. Content and Ideas**
- **Strengths:**  
  - Your essay responds directly to the topic (individuals vs. governments/companies in climate change).
  - You demonstrate awareness of the issue and present your viewpoint—mainly that government and corporate actions are crucial, but individuals also play an important role by influencing policy and adopting green habits.
  - You give relevant examples (protests, voting, lifestyle choices).

- **Possible Improvements:**  
  - Your thesis could be even clearer about *how much* individual actions matter (do you agree with the statement that government/corporate actions are more impactful, or do you give equal weight?).
  - Your argument is developed, but could use a slightly deeper critical analysis (for rubric levels 4–5), such as considering *why* collective advocacy sometimes succeeds or fails.

**Estimated Score:**  
Likely between **3 (Developing)** and **4 (Proficient)**. If you clarify and deepen your thesis and analysis, you can reach 4 or 5.

---

### **2. Organisation and Logical Progression**
- **Strengths:**  
  - Your essay has clear structure (introduction, body paragraphs, conclusion).
  - Each paragraph develops a main idea and uses transitions.

- **Possible Improvements:**  
  - Some ideas could flow more logically. For example, in places, you mention problems (not everyone changes behavior, or governments only listen a little) but don’t always expand on why or how to overcome these issues.
  
**Estimated Score:**  
**4 (Proficient)**. Further coherence and stronger transitions could push to 5.

---

### **3. Vocabulary**
- **Strengths:**  
  - You use appropriate academic terms (e.g., “sustainable,” “collective advocacy,” “carbon emissions”).
  - There is some variety in your word choice.

- **Possible Improvements:**  
  - Occasionally, vocabulary is a bit general (“essential role”, “meaningful small changes”)—try to use more precise, topic-specific words for higher marks.
  - Keep an eye on minor errors or repetition.

**Estimated Score:**  
Between **3 (Developing)** and **4 (Proficient)**.

---

### **4. Grammar and Sentence Structure**
- **Strengths:**  
  - Mostly accurate grammar and spelling. Sentences are complete and generally varied.
  - Clear meaning throughout.

- **Possible Improvements:**  
  - A few sentences could be more concise and academic. Occasionally, a compound sentence could be split for clarity.
  - You have some minor awkward phrasings (“That said, some people prioritize convenience over sustainability and are unwilling to change their habits, which poses a challenge”).

**Estimated Score:**  
**4 (Proficient)**. Proofread once more for minor mistakes.

---

### **OVERALL:**
**Will you pass?**  
**Yes, you are very likely to pass.**  
- Your essay is on-topic, well-structured, and shows clear understanding.
- For higher grades (“Excellent”), you need a slightly more decisive and analytical thesis, more sophisticated vocabulary, and deeper explanation of your supporting points.

**What can you do to improve your score?**  
- Make your thesis statement more explicit about your stance: do you *partly agree* with the statement, or do you strongly believe individuals matter too?
- Use more precise vocabulary and connect supporting points more directly to your thesis.
- Expand your analysis, not just listing actions, but critically considering impact and possible solutions.

**Encouraging Note:**  
You’re doing very well for an intermediate–advanced university level. A few tweaks using the three-step revision process will make your essay even stronger!

**Next Steps:**  
Would you like help revising your thesis and one body paragraph for maximized rubric scores?  
- This will help you get closer to “Excellent” in all areas.

Just let me know! I’m here to guide you step by step, so you can submit with confidence.

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thoughtful revision! Let’s move through the **three-step revision process** with your new draft. We’ll break it down step by step, focusing on guiding you to make your essay even clearer and stronger (and closer to those “Excellent” rubric grades).

---

## **Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**

**Your revised thesis:**
> “While I acknowledge that government and corporate actions are more impactful in driving large-scale climate solutions, I firmly believe individual citizens play an indispensable role by influencing policy decisions through collective advocacy and adopting sustainable daily lifestyles—making their contributions far from negligible.”

**Feedback:**
- **Clarity:** Your thesis is clear about the *relative* importance—government/corporate actions are “more impactful,” but you *firmly believe* individuals are also “indispensable.”
- **Position:** You *partly agree* with the statement that governments/companies matter more, but *strongly* emphasize individuals are still crucial. This communicates a nuanced opinion—excellent!
- **Preview of Main Points:** You clearly preview your points: (1) influencing policy via collective advocacy, (2) adopting sustainable lifestyles.
- **Language:** Confident, precise, and academic.

**Possible Refinement:**  
- To make your comparison slightly sharper, you could consider explicitly previewing which role (individual advocacy vs. lifestyle) you think makes the *biggest* difference. This can help maximize clarity and focus.

**Guiding Prompt:**  
Would you like to try making your thesis even a bit more direct?  
For example, you might clarify that *influencing policy* is the primary way individuals matter, and lifestyle changes are important but secondary. (Optional—your current thesis is already strong!)

**Examples of phrase changes (NOT full sentences):**
- Use: “...with collective advocacy being the most effective way individuals contribute, while sustainable lifestyles create additional support.”
- Or: “...individuals’ most valuable role is as policy influencers, though personal green choices also foster change.”

**Would you like to adjust your thesis to include this emphasis, or are you satisfied with your current version?**  
*(Let me know before we move to Step 2!)*

**Assistant:** Great choice! We're now on **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision** for your paragraph about personal green choices.

### Your Current Topic Sentence:
> "On the other hand, individuals can also make meaningful small changes in their daily lives, such as recycling regularly, conserving water, or choosing to walk or cycle instead of driving."

---

### **Feedback:**
- **Connection to Thesis:** This topic sentence clearly introduces the idea that individuals can make green lifestyle choices. However, let's make sure it clearly connects to your revised thesis—and highlights *why* these daily actions matter, even if they're less impactful than influencing policy.
- **Strength & Focus:** The phrase "meaningful small changes" is good, but could be more precise. Maybe emphasize these actions as "supporting" the larger climate effort, and perhaps reference their role in signaling demand to companies or shaping culture (which you mention later in the paragraph).
- **Preview of Details:** Right now, your topic sentence immediately lists examples. For a stronger topic sentence, consider first generalizing the importance, then expanding on the examples in your supporting sentences.

---

### **Guiding Questions for Revision:**
- Does your topic sentence show that these lifestyle choices, while less impactful than policy, are still valuable for the overall climate movement?
- Can you highlight **how** these individual actions make a difference (for example, by influencing companies, setting examples, or building momentum)?
- Would you like to signal that these habits have a cumulative effect if adopted by many?

---

### **Tips for Revision:**
- Try to **summarize the main idea** first, then explain or list examples later in the paragraph.
- Use connecting words to show the link to your thesis: "In addition to influencing policy..." or "Although less powerful than government action..."

---

### **Sample Starters (not full sentences, just examples for inspiration):**
- "While not as transformative as government policies, individual green habits can collectively support climate efforts through..."
- "In addition to shaping political outcomes, individuals contribute to climate action by..."
- "Though personal lifestyle changes may seem minor, widespread adoption can influence societal norms and business practices..."

**You:** Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. While I acknowledge that government and corporate actions are more impactful in driving large-scale climate solutions, I firmly believe individual citizens play an indispensable role by influencing policy decisions through collective advocacy and adopting sustainable daily lifestyles—making their contributions far from negligible.
One impactful way individuals can drive climate progress is by influencing governments and politicians through coordinated collective action. When large groups of citizens unite to demand stronger environmental laws, governments face tangible public pressure that makes meaningful action more likely. For example, peaceful protests against fossil fuel projects or grassroots campaigns to elect leaders who prioritize climate action have pushed governments to impose stricter pollution regulations and allocate more funding to renewable energy projects. In countries like Germany and Canada, citizens have successfully pressured policymakers to introduce stricter plastic bans and ambitious carbon emission reduction targets. This demonstrates that collective public opinion can be a powerful catalyst for policy change, even if individual voices alone carry less weight. However, collective advocacy sometimes fails because marginalized communities often lack equal access to decision-making channels, and governments may prioritize short-term economic interests over long-term environmental protection. To overcome these barriers, community organizations can provide resources and training to help individuals effectively voice their concerns, such as hosting workshops on how to engage with local representatives.
In addition to shaping political outcomes through collective advocacy, individuals contribute to climate action by making meaningful, consistent changes in their daily lives. While not as transformative as government policies, these personal adjustments can collectively support climate efforts through reducing individual carbon footprints and shaping broader societal norms. Examples include practicing regular recycling, conserving water through low-flow fixtures, or choosing active transportation like walking or cycling instead of driving. Though such lifestyle changes may seem minor on an individual level, widespread adoption can influence both societal expectations and business practices in impactful ways. If many people commit to sustainable living, it creates a ripple effect—encouraging friends, family, and neighbors to follow suit—and sends a clear market signal to companies that consumers are prioritizing eco-friendly products and services. For instance, when a growing number of shoppers choose brands with minimal plastic packaging or ethical sourcing practices, businesses are incentivized to adopt more sustainable operations to remain competitive and profitable. That said, a major barrier to widespread adoption of green lifestyles is the lack of accessible, affordable sustainable options—such as limited public transportation in rural areas or higher prices for eco-friendly products. Addressing this requires individuals to advocate for systemic changes (like improved public transit) while making small, feasible adjustments to their own habits, even if perfect sustainability feels out of reach.
In conclusion, while individual actions alone cannot solve climate change—and government and corporate leadership remains critical—they are far from insignificant. The most valuable contribution individuals can make is driving policy change through collective advocacy, as this empowers systemic solutions that scale beyond personal habits. At the same time, consistent personal sustainable choices help build a culture of environmental responsibility and hold businesses accountable. In my opinion, governments, companies, and individuals must collaborate closely to combat this pressing global problem—with individuals using their voices and daily choices to push for the large-scale changes our planet urgently needs.

**Assistant:** Thank you for following the three-step revision process so carefully! Let’s work together to make your essay even more focused, clear, and connected to your thesis. Here’s how we’ll approach the revision for your **second body paragraph** about personal green choices.

---

## **Step 1: Confirmed Thesis**

Your revised thesis:
> "While I acknowledge that government and corporate actions are more impactful in driving large-scale climate solutions, I firmly believe individual citizens play an indispensable role by influencing policy decisions through collective advocacy and adopting sustainable daily lifestyles—making their contributions far from negligible."

This thesis is **strong and clear**—excellent work! You clearly state that governments and companies are more powerful, but individual actions, especially collective advocacy and personal habits, are still vital.

---

## **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**

**Your revised topic sentence for Paragraph 2:**
> "In addition to shaping political outcomes through collective advocacy, individuals contribute to climate action by making meaningful, consistent changes in their daily lives."

### **Feedback:**
- **Strengths:** Your revised sentence shows a logical link to the thesis and the previous paragraph—smooth transition!
- **Improvements:** To make the connection even tighter, you might consider:
  - **Clarifying Impact:** Briefly signal that while these actions are supportive rather than transformative, they still matter.
  - **Explicit Link to Thesis:** Reinforce that these lifestyle changes are the "second way" individuals are indispensable.

**Revision Prompt:**
- Could you clarify in your topic sentence that these daily actions **support** the broader climate effort, even if they are less impactful than collective advocacy?
- Would you like to add a phrase about their cumulative effect or their influence on societal norms/businesses?

**Example (don't copy directly!):**
- "Though less influential than policy advocacy, individuals help address climate change by adopting sustainable habits in their daily routines, which collectively support broader environmental progress."

Would you like to tweak your topic sentence to include any of these ideas now?  
Type your adjusted sentence, and we’ll check how it fits before moving to step three!

## **Step 3: Revising Supporting Sentences in the Chosen Paragraph**

Let’s make sure the **content of your personal choices paragraph** is clear, unified, and coherent.

### **Guiding Questions:**
- Do all supporting details clearly relate to your (updated) topic sentence and thesis?
- Are examples (recycling, walking/cycling, buying green) clearly explained as ways individuals support climate action?
- Is there any evidence or explanation that could be more concise, more precise, or better connected to the main idea?
- Are barriers (accessibility, affordability) explained in a way that connects back to the overall argument?

#### Example of a focused revision prompt:
- You discuss lack of access (“limited public transport/rural areas”) as a barrier—does your paragraph help readers understand how individuals can respond (advocate for change, make small adjustments) even when full sustainability isn’t possible?
- When describing ripple effects (“encouraging friends, family, ...” and influencing businesses), do you connect clearly to your thesis about the cumulative impact of individual choices?

#### Suggestions (not full rewrites!):

- If you want stronger unity, open with a summary sentence showing this section is about individual daily actions **supporting** systemic climate progress, even if their direct impact is limited.
- Then, explain why widespread adoption of green habits can influence social norms, market trends, and business practices.
- When mentioning barriers, link back to advocacy from the first body paragraph—individuals can advocate for improved green infrastructure, not just make personal changes.

**Would you like to revise any sentence in this paragraph now, such as:**
- Clarifying why personal actions matter even if they seem minor.
- Expanding on how lifestyle habits send signals to companies and support wider change.
- Strengthening your explanation of obstacles and possible solutions.

---

**Your Turn:**  
Please choose **one or two sentences** from your paragraph that you’d like to improve or clarify, and type your revised version.  
If you’re stuck, just point out which sentence feels confusing or weak, and I’ll give guidance or hints!

---

**Summary of Next Steps:**
- Revise your paragraph so all details connect strongly to your topic sentence and thesis.
- Make sure *explanation* (not just listing examples) shows *how* these actions support broader change.
- Clarify the barriers and solutions, connecting them back to individual responsibility and advocacy.
