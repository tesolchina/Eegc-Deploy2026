            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for sharing your full chat history and the assessment report! It looks like you made solid progress following the step-by-step guidance through thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph revision, and you also asked good questions about vocabulary tools and topic-specific words.

If you want, I can help you take the next step by either:

1. Suggesting specific, credible sources and data (NGO reports, labor studies, news articles) to add evidence to your revised essay claims, boosting credibility and depth.

2. Polishing your revised thesis statement and one body paragraph to smooth grammar, transitions, and phrasing for greater clarity and formality.

3. Providing a short exercise to practice using some of the advanced vocabulary and collocations related to migrant workers’ rights that you asked about, to build your confident use of formal academic language.

Just let me know which option(s) you prefer or if you want help with something else! I’m here to support your continued progress.

            ## 🟤 Grading Result *(Hidden from Students)*

            All three revision tasks were completed:
- Revised thesis statement: Yes — the revised essay replaces the vague original thesis with a specific policy claim (“To improve this situation, the government should introduce stronger labour laws and equal pay rules…”).
- Revised one topic sentence: Yes — e.g., the policy paragraph begins with “To improve this situation, the government should introduce stronger labour laws and equal pay rules,” and the exploitation paragraph improves the earlier sentence (“Because of this issue, migrant workers are easily exploited due to weak regulations.”).
- Revised one body paragraph: Yes — multiple body paragraphs were expanded and rewritten (new paragraphs on legal protections/equal pay and on public awareness/employer incentives).

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 15/25 - The essay has a clear topic (migrant worker exploitation) and an example (Hong Kong teachers in Britain), but ideas are underdeveloped and some claims are unclear (e.g., “Because a large part of migraines in developed countries were from underdeveloped places…” contains factual/word-choice errors that obscure the point).
- Organization: 16/25 - A basic structure exists (intro, body, conclusion), but progression is uneven and transitions are weak.
- Vocabulary: 13/25 - Several inappropriate or incorrect words (e.g., “Migraines” for “migrants,” “sweat job”) and informal language reduce academic tone.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 12/25 - Frequent grammatical errors and awkward sentence constructions interfere with clarity (punctuation, subject-verb issues, run-ons).
- **Original Essay Total: 56/100**

Evidence (Original):
- Miswording: “Migraines face serious inequality...” (should be migrants).
- Informal phrasing: “They can only work on the sweat job like delivery and factory workers.”
- Weak thesis: “In my opinion , the local government should take the responsibility to protect migrant rights in different aspects.” (vague, hedged)

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The revised essay presents clearer policy claims and concrete measures (stronger labour laws, equal pay, enforcement, public awareness). The argument previews reasons and develops them across paragraphs.
- Organization: 20/25 - Paragraphing improves: cause (exploitation), policy responses (labour laws/equal pay), complementary measures (public awareness and incentives), and a concluding claim. Logical order is clearer than the original.
- Vocabulary: 19/25 - Much stronger and more appropriate vocabulary (e.g., “exploit(ed)”, “secondary citizens”, “equal pay”, “incentives”, “recognition of qualifications”), though some phrasing could be tightened.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 18/25 - Noticeable improvement in sentence clarity and grammar; a few mechanical errors remain (e.g., missing space in “rules.All”, occasional phrasing that could be smoothed).
- **Revised Essay Total: 77/100**

Evidence (Revised):
- Clear policy thesis: “To improve this situation, the government should introduce stronger labour laws and equal pay rules.”
- Improved topic sentence: “Because of this issue, migrant workers are easily exploited due to weak regulations.”
- Expanded development: paragraph on incentives — “The government can give tax reductions or public recognition to companies that treat migrant workers fairly.”

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +21 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis clarified and made prescriptive with specific policy measures (labour laws, equal pay).
  - Body paragraphs expanded with concrete policy suggestions (enforcement, monitoring, incentives, public awareness).
  - Vocabulary and tone shifted toward more formal, academic language (replacing “sweat job” with “low-paid jobs,” “exploited” used correctly).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Evidence/support: No data, studies, or citations are provided to back claims (e.g., how common wage theft is, or evidence that incentives change employer behavior).
  - Deeper analysis of counterarguments and implementation challenges (costs, enforcement feasibility) is missing.
  - Minor mechanical issues remain (punctuation, spacing, and occasional awkward phrasing like “secondary citizens” could be reworded to “second‑class status” or “marginalized group”).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 11** (assistant and student messages in the session)
- **Conversation Quality:** Moderate and task-focused. The student asked targeted questions about improving the thesis, topic sentences, government measures, tools for vocabulary, and topic-specific vocabulary. The assistant provided structured guidance, revision frames, policy lists, and tools.

Evidence from chat:
- Student initiated: “how can i improbe the thesis statement” and later “How can I make my topic sentance clearer?” and “Can you give me some suggestions… How can the government protect migrants workers” — demonstrates focused, relevant queries.
- Assistant provided stepwise revision plan and concrete frames (e.g., thesis frames and topic-sentence templates) and a vocabulary list tailored to the topic.

#### Interaction Scores:
- In-Depth Conversation: 3/5 - The chat has a moderate number of exchanges (11) with focused, relevant questions. This shows developing depth but falls short of extensive, multi-level interrogation (not in the 15+ range).
  - Evidence: Multiple focused questions across thesis, topic sentences, policy measures, and vocabulary, but no prolonged back-and-forth on a single drafted revision.
- Critical Review of AI Suggestions: 2/5 - The student asked clarifying questions and requested resources, but there is little evidence of explicit critical evaluation or rejection of suggestions in the chat. The student accepted guidance implicitly and revised offline rather than debating alternative suggestions in-chat.
  - Evidence: The student asks “Are there any professional vovab tools…” and “i mean is there some topics related vocabulary…” — these are information-seeking rather than evaluative. No messages such as “I don’t agree with X because…” or “I want a different approach than Y.”
- Refining Process: 3/5 - Some iterative guidance was provided (thesis frames, topic-sentence frames, vocabulary lists). However, the student did not post draft iterations in the chat for immediate feedback; revisions appear to have been made outside the chat and then uploaded as the revised essay.
  - Evidence: Assistant proposed Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 workflow; the student asked for help with each step, but did not share interim drafts for in-chat revision cycles.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 8/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Focused topic and relevant example: The student kept a clear topic (migrant workers’ workplace inequality) and used the Hong Kong → Britain example.
- Effective uptake of AI guidance: The revised essay reflects assistant suggestions (clearer thesis, concrete policy measures, more formal vocabulary).
  - Evidence: Revised thesis — “To improve this situation, the government should introduce stronger labour laws and equal pay rules.”
- Use of academic vocabulary and structure: The revision replaces many informal words with formal alternatives and adds organized paragraphs outlining policy responses.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Use evidence and sources: Strengthen claims with statistics, studies, or authoritative reports (e.g., labour inspectorate reports, NGO studies) to increase credibility.
- Iterative in-chat drafting: Share drafts or sentence revisions in the chat to receive targeted, line-level feedback and to demonstrate critical evaluation of AI suggestions.
- Grammar and mechanical polish: Fix remaining punctuation and spacing errors and smooth some phrasing (e.g., “secondary citizens” → “marginalized group”).
- Depth of policy analysis: Discuss implementation challenges, specific enforcement mechanisms, or examples of successful policies (country cases) to deepen the argument.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Good — The student provided the full original essay and asked specific revision goals and questions (thesis, topic sentences, vocabulary).
- Strategic Planning: Good — The student followed a coherent revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) and asked stepwise questions, though they did not always follow the exact order in-chat.
- Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement — The student asked many questions but did not clearly critique AI suggestions or weigh alternatives in the chat.
- Independent Editing: Good — The student applied suggestions to produce a substantially revised essay (evidence: revised essay content), showing ability to edit independently.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Add evidence and citations: Include at least one or two sources (reports, studies, news items) to back major claims and to strengthen credibility of policy recommendations.
2. Use the chat iteratively: Post draft thesis/topic sentences and paragraph drafts in chat for targeted line-level feedback and to demonstrate critical engagement with AI suggestions.
3. Tighten language and mechanics: Run the revised draft through a grammar/style tool and do a careful manual pass to fix spacing, punctuation, and phrasing. Replace “secondary citizens” with more precise, less loaded terms (e.g., “marginalized group” or “second‑class status”).

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student completed the required revision tasks and clearly used AI guidance to improve thesis clarity, topic sentences, and body paragraphs.
- The student would benefit from guidance on integrating evidence/citations and on documenting the revision process in the chat (this helps assess critical engagement with AI).
- The student shows good progress; continued practice with in-chat drafting and source integration will move their work from “Good” toward “Excellent.”

If you would like, I can:
- Suggest specific citations or public reports to support the claims in the revised essay.
- Provide a polished version of the thesis and one paragraph with tighter grammar and transitions (I will not rewrite without your permission).

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
In most developed countries, Migraines face serious inequality in the workplace. Because a large part of migraines in developed countries were from underdeveloped places and didn't have the professional ability to find a good job that provided a high salary. They can only work on the sweat job like delivery and factory workers. Even the educated people who have high salary jobs in their homeland also cannot find a job that has the same level with their original career. For example, many Hong Kong people had migrated to Britain. Some of them were eighty teachers in Hong Kong , but it is hard for them to find an education-related job in Britain.

  Because of this issue, migrant workers are easily faced exploitation due to weak regulations. They are the “secondary” citizens, so that they may face unfair conditions in the workplace, such as long working hours and lower pay compared to the local employee.

  In my opinion , the local government should take the responsibility to protect migrant rights in different aspects. Working  is the main income for living. If migrant rights cannot safeguard by the government, it may lead to a great negative impact on the whole society and destroy their lives.


Revised:
In most developed countries, migrant workers face serious inequality in the workplace. Many of them come from underdeveloped places and do not have the professional ability to find good jobs that provide high salaries. They can only work in low-paid jobs such as delivery or factory work. Even educated people who had high-salary jobs in their homeland also cannot find a job at the same level as their original career. For example, many Hong Kong people have migrated to Britain. Some of them were teachers in Hong Kong, but it is hard for them to find education-related jobs in Britain.

Because of this issue, migrant workers are easily exploited due to weak regulations. They are often treated as “secondary” citizens, so they may face unfair conditions in the workplace, such as long working hours and lower pay compared to local employees.

To improve this situation, the government should introduce stronger labour laws and equal pay rules.All employees, no matter where they come from, should have fair working conditions and wages. The government should strictly monitor employers and punish those who exploit migrant workers. Equal pay for equal work can also build trust between local and migrant employees and make the workplace more just and productive.

Besides legal protection, raising public awareness and providing employer incentives can also help protect migrant workers’ rights. Schools and the media can promote respect and understanding, showing that migrant workers contribute greatly to society. The government can give tax reductions or public recognition to companies that treat migrant workers fairly. These actions will encourage more employers to create inclusive and respectful working environments.

In my opinion, the local government should take the responsibility to protect migrant workers’ rights in different aspects. Working is the main income for living. If migrant rights cannot be safeguarded by the government, it may lead to a great negative impact on the whole society and destroy their lives. Therefore, the protection of migrant workers is not only a matter of fairness but also a key to building a harmonious society

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:35:46.890Z

**You:** how can i improbe the thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:38:02.762Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for asking. Before I jump in, let’s clarify a couple of quick things so I can give the most useful help.

1) What are your priorities for this session? (Pick up to two)
- Strengthening the thesis / argument
- Improving clarity and grammar
- Better organization / topic sentences
- Stronger evidence and development

Which of these do you want me to focus on right now?

Diagnostic feedback (brief)
- Thesis & Argument: Your current thesis (“In my opinion, the local government should take the responsibility to protect migrant rights in different aspects.”) states a position but is weak: it hedges (“In my opinion”), is vague (“different aspects”), and doesn’t preview specific reasons or the structure of your essay.
- Organization: The essay has a clear topic (migrant exploitation) and a relevant example (Hong Kong teachers in Britain). But the introduction is unfocused and grammar mistakes make the logic harder to follow.
- Evidence & Development: You use an example, which is good, but it needs clearer explanation and connection to the main claim.
- Language Use: Frequent word choice and grammar errors (e.g., “Migraines” → migrants, “sweat job,” punctuation and sentence fragments) reduce clarity.

Strengths to build on
- Topic is timely and relevant.
- You already take a position and include at least one concrete example.
- You understand the direction: government responsibility to protect rights.

Which issue would you like to focus on first?
- If you pick “thesis,” we’ll do Step 1 now (thesis work), then move on to a paragraph you choose.
Please confirm you want to focus on the thesis. Once you confirm, we’ll start Step 1.

Step 1 — Thesis guidance (once you confirm)
I’ll give a short checklist and some guidance to help you rewrite your thesis yourself (I won’t write the full sentence for you unless you ask):

Checklist for a strong thesis
- Directly answer the question (Yes or No) clearly.
- Preview 2–3 main reasons or the structure you will use in the essay (so the reader knows what to expect).
- Use confident, specific language (avoid “In my opinion,” “maybe,” “different aspects”).
- Be concise: one or two sentences is enough.

Helpful frame you can use (fill the blanks)
- “Yes — governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers because ______, ______, and ______.”
Or:
- “Governments must strengthen labor regulations for migrant workers to ______, ______, and ______.”

Types of reasons you might include (choose two or three)
- Reduce exploitation (e.g., enforce fair wages and limits on hours)
- Provide legal protections and access to complaint mechanisms
- Prevent social and economic harms (public health, social stability)
- Promote fair labor markets and human rights

Would you like to try drafting a revised thesis now using one of those frames? I’ll give quick feedback and help you refine it.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:38:20.851Z

**You:** How can I make my topic sentance clearer?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:44:48.325Z

**Assistant:** Good question — that’s an important part of making your paragraph stronger.

Quick note before we start: our planned workflow normally revises the thesis first (Step 1) and then moves to topic sentences (Step 2). Do you want to follow that order now? If you’d rather jump straight to topic sentences for practice, that’s fine for a quick session — but when we do the full revision, we’ll update the thesis first so every topic sentence clearly ties back to it. Which would you prefer?

Tips to make a topic sentence clearer (short checklist)
- Say one clear claim: state the main idea of the paragraph in one sentence.  
- Connect it to the thesis: show how this paragraph supports your overall argument (for example, by focusing on wages, hours, legal protections, or social effects).  
- Preview what you’ll prove or the evidence you’ll use (so the reader knows what to expect).  
- Use specific, concrete language (avoid vague words like “different aspects,” “this issue,” or “it may lead”).  
- Keep it concise and active (one strong clause, present-tense verb).  
- Avoid hedging and filler (no “I think,” “maybe,” or “in my opinion”).

Frames you can use (fill the blanks)
- “One reason governments should strengthen labor laws is to _______ (what this paragraph will show).”  
- “Stricter enforcement of [specific policy] would help protect migrant workers by _______.”  
- “Weak regulations allow employers to _______; therefore, governments must _______ to prevent this.”  

Would you like to try revising your paragraph’s topic sentence now using one of those frames? If so, paste the current topic sentence you want to work on (or tell me which paragraph — e.g., the paragraph with the Hong Kong teachers example), and try one short revision. I’ll give quick, focused feedback and help you tighten it.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:45:10.490Z

**You:** Can you give me some suggestions that?How can the government protect migrants workers

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:47:16.190Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m glad you asked. Let’s do this step by step so the revision helps you learn.

First, quick check: pick up to two priorities you want me to focus on in this session
- Strengthening the thesis / argument
- Improving clarity and grammar
- Better organization / topic sentences
- Stronger evidence and development

Which two would you like?

Brief diagnostic feedback (very short)
- Thesis & Argument: You state a position but it’s vague and hedged (“In my opinion,” “different aspects”) and doesn’t preview reasons.  
- Organization: You have a clear topic and an example (Hong Kong teachers), but sentences and some word choices (e.g., “Migraines” → migrants; “sweat job”) make your ideas hard to follow.  
- Evidence & Development: Example is useful but needs clearer explanation and link to the claim.  
- Language Use: Several grammar and word-choice errors that reduce clarity.

Now — your direct question: How can governments protect migrant workers? Here are clear, concrete policy measures and actions you can use as reasons in your thesis and as points in body paragraphs. Pick 2–3 of these to use in your essay.

Suggestions for how governments can protect migrant workers
- Stronger labor laws and equal-pay rules: Require that migrant workers receive the same minimum wage, overtime pay, and benefits as local workers.  
- Better enforcement and inspections: Fund labor inspections, punish employers who break rules, and reduce informal work where violations hide.  
- Legal access and complaint mechanisms: Provide accessible complaint procedures, legal aid, and language support so migrants can report abuse without fear.  
- Recognition of qualifications and work pathways: Create systems to recognize foreign credentials and offer retraining, so skilled migrants aren’t forced into low-paid jobs.  
- Anti-discrimination and anti-exploitation laws: Enforce anti-discrimination laws and specific rules banning practices that exploit migrants (e.g., passport confiscation, debt bondage).  
- Regularization and worker documentation: Provide clear, fair visa and regularization processes so migrants are not undocumented and vulnerable.  
- Social protections and healthcare access: Extend basic social safety nets, workplace injury compensation, and public health access to migrant workers.  
- Partnerships with NGOs and unions: Support NGOs, community groups, and labor unions that educate migrants about rights and help enforce standards.  
- Public awareness and employer incentives: Run awareness campaigns and offer incentives for fair employers (certification, public recognition) to change behavior.

Pick 2–3 of these measures you’d like to use as your main reasons in the essay (for example: “equal pay,” “better enforcement,” and “legal access/complaints”).

Step 1 — Thesis work
- Quick checklist for a strong thesis: say Yes or No clearly; preview 2–3 reasons; use confident, specific language; be concise.
- Useful frame (fill the blanks): “Yes — governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers because _____, _____, and _____.”

Would you like to try drafting a revised thesis using that frame now? If so, tell me which 2–3 measures you picked from the list above and write one sentence. I’ll give quick feedback and help you refine it.

Also: Do you want to follow the normal order (thesis first, then topic sentence + paragraph), or would you prefer to jump to a paragraph (for example, the paragraph with the Hong Kong teachers example)? Which do you prefer?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:47:29.436Z

**You:** Are there any professional vovab tools that can be used for this research?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:57:20.329Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I think you meant “vocab” tools (no problem). First, quick step so we stay on track for the revision session:

Please pick up to two priorities now (so I can tailor recommendations and the revision):
- Strengthening the thesis / argument
- Improving clarity and grammar
- Better organization / topic sentences
- Stronger evidence and development

Do you want to focus on the thesis first (the usual order), or would you rather jump to a paragraph?

Now, on to your question: professional vocabulary (vocab) tools you can use for research and essay revision, with short notes on how to use each one for this assignment.

High-value tools for academic vocabulary and usage
- Cambridge Academic Phrasebank (free): Model phrases and sentence frames for academic writing (introductions, thesis statements, topic sentences, linking, hedging). Use it to find formal ways to state claims and link ideas.
- Academic Word List (AWL) / New Academic Word List (NAWL): Lists of high-frequency academic words. Use the lists to check whether your essay uses appropriate academic vocabulary; aim for precision rather than overuse.
- VocabProfile / Compleat Lexical Tutor (free): Upload your text to see how much academic vocabulary it contains (AWL coverage) and get feedback on lexical range. Good for diagnosing whether your language is suitably academic.
- COCA (Corpus of Contemporary American English) / BYU corpora (some free features): Search real usage examples, collocations, and frequency for words/phrases. Use it to check how native, formal, and common a phrase or collocation is.
- Sketch Engine (paid, professional): Powerful corpus tool for collocations, word sketches, and concordances across many corpora. Very useful if you want in-depth collocation and register info.
- AntConc (free): A concordancer you can run on a folder of texts (e.g., sample academic articles) to find patterns and collocations. Useful for self-built mini-corpora.
- JustTheWord / Oxford Collocations Dictionary: Help you find natural collocations (which verbs go with which nouns, common adjective–noun pairings). Use these to replace awkward phrasing like “sweat job” with natural collocations (“manual labor,” “low-paid work”).
- Google Ngram Viewer (free): Check historical frequency of phrases in published books — helpful for choosing conventional phrasing, less useful for modern spoken usage.
- Cambridge / Oxford learner dictionaries & Collins COBUILD: Provide usage examples and register labels (formal, informal). Good for choosing the right word for academic tone.

Tools for learning and practicing vocabulary
- Anki (free): Spaced-repetition flashcards for memorizing words/phrases you plan to use.
- Quizlet / Memrise / Vocabulary.com: Easier interfaces for practice and quick lists.

Editing and style tools (helpful but not replacements for learning)
- Grammarly / ProWritingAid (freemium/paid): Catch grammar, tone, and vocabulary suggestions. Be cautious: they sometimes recommend informal or imprecise edits for academic writing — use suggestions selectively.
- Academic Phrasebank + phrase templates (again) are better than generic grammar tools for building strong academic sentences.

Quick suggestions for how to use these tools on your essay
- Use Academic Phrasebank to craft a stronger thesis and clearer topic sentences.
- Run your paragraph through VocabProfile to see if you’re using enough academic vocabulary and to spot overuse of informal words (e.g., “sweat job,” “secondary citizens”).
- Check collocations for tricky phrases in COCA or JustTheWord (e.g., “low-paid work,” “exploit migrant workers,” “recognition of qualifications”).
- If you plan to learn new target words, add them to Anki with example sentences from the corpus or phrasebank.

Would you like tailored recommendations from this list based on your chosen priorities? For example:
- If you want to strengthen the thesis and topic sentences: I’d recommend Cambridge Academic Phrasebank + VocabProfile.
- If you want to improve word choice and collocations: check COCA/JustTheWord + Oxford Collocations.

Tell me which priorities you pick and whether you want to start with the thesis now. If you want, I can also guide you step-by-step using one of these tools on your current paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:57:39.433Z

**You:** i mean is there some topics related vocabulary that I can use in the essay

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:58:35.589Z

**Assistant:** Great — this is a useful request. Before I give the vocabulary list, quick check so we stay on track for the revision session.

1) Pick up to two priorities for this session (choose from):
- Strengthening the thesis / argument
- Improving clarity and grammar
- Better organization / topic sentences
- Stronger evidence and development

Which two would you like to focus on? Also: do you want to work on the thesis first (the usual order), or jump straight into vocabulary and then a paragraph?

Brief diagnosis tied to vocabulary needs (one sentence)
- Your draft needs more formal, precise vocabulary (and fewer informal or incorrect phrases like “sweat job,” “secondary citizens,” or “Migraines”) so your ideas read as academic and clear.

Now, vocabulary you can use in this essay
(Use these to replace informal words, build topic sentences, and strengthen thesis reasons. Try to practice collocations — verbs and nouns that naturally go together.)

Core nouns and noun phrases
- migrant worker(s), migrant labour/migrant labor, foreign-born workers, seasonal workers, guest workers, undocumented workers, migrant communities
- exploitation, forced labour / forced labor, wage theft, poor working conditions, occupational safety, labour standards, labour market integration
- labor regulations, employment legislation, legal protections, complaint mechanisms, labour inspectorate, social protection, credential recognition
- recruitment fees, debt bondage, passport confiscation, subcontracting, temporary contracts, informal sector

Useful verbs and verb phrases
- exploit / be exploited, underpay, withhold wages, overwork, discriminate against, employ on temporary contracts
- enforce laws / enforce regulations, prosecute employers, regularise / regularize employment, recognise / recognize qualifications
- formalise employment, provide legal aid, access complaint mechanisms, unionise / unionize, monitor compliance, impose penalties

Adjectives and adjectival phrases
- vulnerable, marginalized / marginalised, low‑paid / low‑wage, precarious, informal, exploitative, systemic, structural, enforceable, rights‑based
- undocumented, underemployed, occupationally unsafe, discriminatory, inequitable

Collocations and multi-word phrases (very useful)
- exploit migrant workers; wage theft and unpaid overtime; long working hours; unsafe working conditions
- lack of legal protection; precarious employment; irregular/undocumented status; recognition of foreign qualifications
- labour inspection and enforcement; minimum wage compliance; access to justice; complaint and redress mechanisms
- recruitment fees leading to debt bondage; subcontracting to evade liability; supply-chain accountability

Policy and legal vocabulary (for thesis / body points)
- labour regulations / labor regulations; employment legislation; enforcement mechanisms; penalties and sanctions
- regularization schemes; work permits and visas; bilateral labour agreements; memorandum of understanding (MoU)
- anti‑trafficking laws; collective bargaining rights; union representation; legal aid and translation services

Academic linking language (for argument flow)
- therefore, consequently, as a result, moreover, furthermore, in addition, however, despite this, whereas, given that, due to
- to address this issue; to mitigate exploitation; policy interventions such as…; empirical evidence suggests…

Stronger, more formal synonyms for casual phrases in your draft
- “sweat job” → manual labour / manual labor; low‑paid work; menial work
- “secondary citizens” → marginalized group; second‑class status; socially and economically disadvantaged
- “didn't have the professional ability” → lacked recognition of qualifications; faced barriers to credential recognition; experienced underemployment

Phrases for evidence and example sentences
- for example; for instance; a notable example is; according to [source]; studies show that; data indicate that; case studies reveal

Argumentative verbs useful in thesis and topic sentences
- must, should, ought to, need to, are required to, are responsible for, are obligated to

How to use this vocabulary (short tips)
- Choose 8–12 high‑value words/phrases to focus on (e.g., migrant worker(s), wage theft, enforcement mechanisms, recognition of qualifications, vulnerable, precarious). Try to use those consistently.
- Use collocations (e.g., “wage theft and unpaid overtime,” “labour inspection and enforcement”) rather than inventing new phrases.
- Replace casual wording with the formal synonyms above, especially in the thesis and topic sentences.
- Use linking phrases to show cause and effect (e.g., “Because migrant workers often lack legal protection, they are vulnerable to wage theft and long working hours. Therefore, governments should…”).

Would you like:
- A short exercise: pick 6 words from the list and try to use them in one sentence (I’ll give feedback)?
- Or shall we move to Step 1 and draft a stronger thesis using 2–3 policy measures (I can prompt you to choose which measures to include)?

Tell me your two priorities and which option you prefer next.
