  The essay is generally well-structured, with clear paragraphs and a logical overall flow. Paragraph unity could be improved, and some transitions are abrupt.
- **Vocabulary: 18/25**  
  The vocabulary is mostly sufficient and on-topic, but there are frequent informal expressions and some repetition. Some word choices are not fully academic or precise (e.g., “normal people,” “a big effect”).
- **Grammar: 18/25**  
  Simple sentence structures dominate. There are recurring minor errors (“maybe just listen a little,” “so nothing happen,” “is not always working well”) which occasionally obscure meaning.
- **Original Essay Total: 77/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
(*Partial essay revision – only introduction/thesis and one body paragraph revised; some sections missing*)
- **Content and Ideas: 22/25**  
  The revised sections show a sharper focus on how individuals can influence governments (through campaign, advocacy, public pressure) and more academic explanation of limitations. Overall ideas are clearer and more academically presented.
- **Organization: 22/25**  
  Paragraph structure is improved, with stronger topic sentences and clearer logical flow within the revised body paragraph. Transitions and cohesion have increased.
- **Vocabulary: 21/25**  
  Noticeable improvement in academic vocabulary and variety (e.g., “collective action,” “advocacy,” “environmental policies,” “effectively communicating their concerns”). Occasional repetition and minor imprecision remain.
- **Grammar: 21/25**  
  Sentence variety and accuracy have increased, with more complex constructions. Occasional verb agreement issues, but overall clarity improved.
- **Revised Essay Total: 86/100**  
  *(Score reflects only the revised sections. The essay remains incomplete as the second body paragraph and conclusion are missing.)*

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +9 points** (for the revised sections)
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clear, academically worded and focused thesis statement aligning with the essay question and previewing key arguments.
  - Stronger, more focused topic sentence in the body paragraph, with explicit connection to the thesis.
  - Supporting sentences in the first body paragraph are now much more academic and precise, demonstrating clear logical progression and topic-relevant vocabulary.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The essay revision is incomplete: the second body paragraph (on personal green habits) has not been revised at all, and the conclusion is missing from the new draft.
  - Full essay cohesion and paragraph transitions across the whole piece (especially in the unrevised sections) cannot be assessed.

---

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 37**
- **Conversation Quality:**  
  The conversation is detailed, iterative, and highly focused on the revision process for the thesis statement, topic sentence, and one body paragraph. The user is actively engaged, asks for feedback, and applies suggestions, but stops before addressing the entire essay. There is some evidence of critical thinking and increasing independence in applying AI feedback.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation:** 4/5  
  The chat contains robust, multi-level exchanges. The student asks for specific feedback, tries revisions multiple times, and shows a deepening understanding of academic writing structure on the revised section. Additional in-depth questioning about the remaining essay sections is absent.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions:** 4/5  
  The student often revises AI-derived suggestions rather than accepting them blindly (e.g., testing different thesis and topic sentences, seeking clarification on academic tone, working through sentence structure with AI). However, all AI suggestions were essentially accepted or slightly modified; explicit rejection/justification is limited.
- **Refining Process:** 5/5  
  Clear iterative cycles are present for the revised paragraph: multiple attempts at thesis and topic sentences, stepwise body revision, and attention to sentence-level cohesion. Student demonstrates refining work based on AI input at each stage for the sections attempted.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 13/15**

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- **Collaboration with AI:**  
  The student engages fully with the AI, actively seeking and responding to feedback, and iteratively refining their work (e.g., repeated thesis statement drafts and revision cycles on the first body paragraph).
- **Paragraph Development:**  
  Significant improvement in the logic, academic tone, precision, and complexity of the revised paragraph, indicating successful application of feedback.
- **Adoption of Academic Conventions:**  
  Clear progression toward more academic vocabulary, advanced structure, and nuanced argumentation in the revised material.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- **Completion:**  
  The revision process is unfinished; the student did not revise the second body paragraph or the conclusion, which is critical for full essay development.
- **Whole-Essay Cohesion:**  
  Integration across all essay parts (topic sentences, transitions, overall arc) should be revised for academic cohesion, not just selected sections.
- **Independent Reflection/Critical Challenge:**  
  More evidence of challenging or independently adapting AI suggestions or explicitly rejecting them with justification could further demonstrate critical thinking growth.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision:** Good  
  The student clearly provides relevant essay content, but provides limited meta-commentary or clarifying of course objectives beyond what the AI prompts.
- **Strategic Planning:** Excellent  
  The revision process is methodical and follows AI prompts closely, working step-by-step through thesis/topic/body.
- **Critical Evaluation:** Good  
  The student revises suggestions thoughtfully, but could go further in critiquing, questioning, or customizing AI advice.
- **Independent Editing:** Good  
  Multiple revision attempts are made, though always in response to prompts; little evidence of striking out alone beyond the AI framework.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

1. **Complete Full-Essay Revision:**  
   Continue the structured approach to revise ALL paragraphs—including remaining body and conclusion—for cohesion and clarity.
2. **Actively Critique AI Suggestions:**  
   Practice not just accepting but questioning, refining, and if necessary rejecting AI suggestions—and justify why (to show critical engagement).
3. **Advance Independent Editing:**  
   After applying AI feedback, independently review the full draft for coherence, transitions, and academic tone across all sections.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES

- The student has gained considerable benefit from the AI-assisted revision model, but *has not completed the full assigned process* (revision of thesis, one topic sentence, and one paragraph were thoroughly revised; the remainder is incomplete).
- The student demonstrates growing confidence and understanding of academic conventions, though assessment is limited by incomplete essay revision.
- Encourage the student to always bring draft work to full completion and to push further in critically appraising and adapting AI-sourced feedback. 

**Overall, strong potential for both academic writing improvement and effective, iterative AI collaboration—once essay revision is carried fully through.**

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
While government and company actions are essential in combating climate change, individual actions—including pressuring policymakers and choosing sustainable lifestyles—also have a meaningful impact. This shows that If everyone works together then we can make a substantial effect. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians because without it, nothing will change. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. Individuals play a crucial role in combating climate change by actively influencing government policies through advocacy and collective action. Through public demonstrations or by voting for environmentally-focused politicians, citizens can encourage governments to enact effective environmental policies such as pollution bans or investments in clean energy. In more developed countries, citizens have organized campaigns that aim to influence policymakers on environmental issues. These actions have led legislators to introduce new regulations about reducing plastic use and carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. However, governments may not respond strongly to public pressure. Moreover, sometimes citizens may encounter challenges in effectively communicating their concerns to policymakers.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:02:43.455Z

**You:** Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:03:59.407Z

**Assistant:** Great—thank you for sharing your thesis statement!  
Let's work through Step 1: Revising the Thesis Statement.

**Feedback on your current thesis statement:**

- **Clarity:** Your thesis introduces the topic well, but it doesn't make your viewpoint completely clear yet.  
- **Strength:** The language is confident, but it doesn't answer the essay question directly or preview your main points.  
- **Focus:** Consider specifying *how* you agree or disagree, and what your essay will cover.

**Guidance for revision:**

- Make your position clear—do you mostly agree, mostly disagree, or have a balanced view?  
- Mention both the government/companies and individual actions, because your essay compares their impacts.  
- Preview your main supporting arguments: citizens influencing the government, and personal green habits.

**Prompt:**  
Based on this feedback, would you like to try revising your thesis statement now?  
Remember to:  
- Clearly state your answer to the question.
- Mention your main points.
- Use direct, confident language (avoid “I think” or “maybe”). 

When you’re ready, please share your revised thesis statement here!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:04:02.671Z

**You:** Climate change is a severe problem today in the contemporary world. The masses argue that the actions of individuals hold no weight compared to what governments and significant companies can do.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:06:52.208Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for your revised thesis statement!

Here’s some constructive feedback:

**Clarity:** You have identified climate change as a serious issue and summarized the opposing view. However, your personal stance is missing—are you agreeing, disagreeing, or taking a balanced view?

**Strength:** Your language is confident, but to make your thesis stronger, you should directly respond to the essay question, giving your own viewpoint.

**Focus:** Your thesis doesn’t preview the main points that your essay will discuss, for example, the influence of citizens on governments and the impact of green lifestyle choices.

**Next Steps:**  
Would you like to try revising the thesis statement again? Remember to clearly express your own position and briefly mention the main points you will address in the essay.

Try starting with:  
“While government and company actions are critical in combating climate change, individual actions—such as influencing government policies and adopting green habits—also play an important role.”

Or, you can build on your previous draft, but include your personal view and preview your arguments.

Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:06:56.471Z

**You:** While government and company actions are critical in combating climate change, individual actions—such as influencing government policies and adopting green habits—also play an important role. From my perspective, I believe that even the smallest ants can move a rock. If everyone works together then we can make a substantial effect.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:08:46.122Z

**Assistant:** Great work—your revised thesis is much clearer and stronger! You now mention both the importance of government/company actions and the value of individual efforts, which is excellent. Here’s some feedback to help you refine it even further:

### Feedback:
- **Clarity and Strength:** The first sentence is concise and clearly answers the essay question. Well done!
- **Personal Voice:** Your example (“even the smallest ants can move a rock”) is creative, but for academic writing, try to maintain a formal tone and avoid metaphors that might sound informal or distracting.
- **Focus & Preview:** You mention influencing government and adopting green habits, which sets up your body paragraphs. That’s great!
- **Confidence:** “From my perspective, I believe that…” can be shortened for directness (e.g., “This shows that…” or just stating your view).

### Suggestion:
Keep your thesis focused, direct, and academic. For example:  
“While government and company actions are essential in combating climate change, individual actions—including pressuring policymakers and choosing sustainable lifestyles—also have a meaningful impact.”

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try one more revision of your thesis statement, using clear, academic language and directly previewing your two main arguments (influencing government; adopting green habits)?

Please share your final thesis statement here when you’re ready. Let me know if you are satisfied with this version before we move to Step 2!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:08:58.357Z

**You:** While government and company actions are essential in combating climate change, individual actions—including pressuring policymakers and choosing sustainable lifestyles—also have a meaningful impact. This shows that If everyone works together then we can make a substantial effect.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:09:53.354Z

**Assistant:** Excellent work! Your thesis statement is now clear, confident, and academic. You’ve made your position direct, previewed your two main arguments, and answered the essay question—well done!

**Quick feedback:**
- The first sentence is strong and effectively sets up your essay.
- The second sentence (“This shows that if everyone works together then we can make a substantial effect.”) is positive. For academic writing, consider rephrasing slightly for precision, but overall, it works.

**Prompt before moving on:**  
Are you satisfied with this thesis statement, or would you like to make any final adjustments? Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 2: Revising a topic sentence.

---

**Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**

Now, please choose **one body paragraph** you’d like to focus on for revision:

- The paragraph about **individuals influencing the government**,  
or  
- The paragraph about **individuals adopting green habits**.

Let me know which paragraph you’d like to revise. Then, please share its current topic sentence. I’ll give you focused feedback before we work on improving it together!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:10:01.664Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:12:24.900Z

**Assistant:** Great choice! Let's look closely at your current topic sentence:

> "The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians."

**Feedback:**
- **Connection to Thesis:** This topic sentence matches your thesis (which previews government influence) and clearly identifies the paragraph’s focus. Well done!
- **Strength:** The phrase “the most important way” is confident, but it might be helpful to clarify why influencing the government is so key.
- **Clarity:** Consider specifying that individuals do this through actions like voting, advocacy, or public pressure.

**Guidance:**
- Restate the topic sentence to clearly show how this main idea supports your thesis and ties to your body paragraph’s evidence.
- Try to use language that previews the supporting points you’ll include (e.g., public opinion, protest, voting).

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now?  
Aim for a sentence that directly connects to your thesis and hints at what supporting ideas you’ll develop.

If you’d like, I can offer an example or a guiding structure! Just let me know.

When you’re ready, please share your revised topic sentence.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:12:29.611Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians because without it, nothing will change. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. We can vote, do advocies online, or even rally to show a message.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:14:58.525Z

**Assistant:** Great effort on revising your topic sentence! Let's review it together:

**Current revised topic sentence:**  
>The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians because without it, nothing will change.

**Feedback:**
- **Connection to Thesis:** You clearly relate the topic to your thesis about individual influence on government—excellent!
- **Clarity:** You explain *why* influencing the government is important (“because without it, nothing will change”), which adds strength. 
- **Focus and Precision:** There’s room to make your sentence even more academic. Try to avoid expressions like “nothing will change,” which sounds absolute—give a more measured statement if possible.
- **Preview:** You hint at supporting details (voting, advocacy, rallies), but these examples might work better as part of the paragraph, not inside the topic sentence itself.

**Suggestions for improvement:**  
- Clarify how individuals influence the government (through voting, advocacy, public pressure, etc.).
- Use confident, precise wording. For example, “Individuals play a crucial role in combating climate change by actively influencing government policies through advocacy and collective action.”

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try revising your topic sentence one more time?  
Aim for a sentence that:
- Clearly states individuals’ key role in influencing government policies,
- Reflects academic tone,
- Previews how their influence works (but briefly—save details for supporting sentences).

Let me know your revision when you’re ready!  
Once you’re satisfied, will move to revising the rest of the paragraph for clarity and coherence.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:15:04.132Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians because without it, governments won't know what the citizens want. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. We can influence the government by exercing public pressure because individuals play a crucial role in combating climate change by actively influencing government policies through advocacy and collective action.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:17:10.190Z

**Assistant:** Nice work giving this topic sentence another try! Here’s some constructive feedback on your latest version:

---

**Review of Your Revised Topic Sentence:**

- **Strengths:**  
  - You clearly state that individuals help fight climate change by influencing governments and politicians.
  - You attempt to explain *why* this is important—governments need public input to know what citizens want.
  - You mention “public pressure,” “advocacy,” and “collective action,” which preview supporting ideas.

- **Areas to Improve:**  
  - Your topic sentence is a bit too long and contains overlapping ideas.
  - Some supporting points ("When many citizens demand better laws...") sound more like evidence—they belong in the body of the paragraph, not the topic sentence.
  - Let's aim for one clear, focused topic sentence at the start of the paragraph, with supporting examples following later.

---

**Guidance for Revision:**

- *Keep your topic sentence to one main idea.*
- *State clearly how individuals make a difference by influencing government decisions for climate action.*
- *Save specific evidence and explanation for the rest of the paragraph—they will build support for your topic sentence.*

---

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now?  
Here are some guiding questions to help:

- Can you state—in one academic sentence—*how individuals’ influence on government is a key way they can address climate change*?
- Try using words like “advocacy,” “public pressure,” and “collective action” as hints for supporting ideas, not full explanations.

If you’d like an example structure, let me know!  
Otherwise, give it another go and share your one-sentence revision here.

Once you’re satisfied, we’ll work on the rest of the paragraph next.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:17:14.799Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians because without it, nothing will change. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. Individuals play a crucial role in combating climate change by actively influencing government policies through advocacy and collective action.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:19:00.887Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic effort in revising your topic sentence! You're getting closer to a clear, academic statement.

**Quick feedback:**
- Your latest sentence, “Individuals play a crucial role in combating climate change by actively influencing government policies through advocacy and collective action,” is strong, focused, and sets up your paragraph well.
- It is academic and previews how individuals can make an impact (advocacy, collective action).

Are you satisfied with this topic sentence?  
If yes, let’s move to Step 3: Revising the supporting sentences in your chosen paragraph.

---

**Step 3: Revising the Paragraph’s Supporting Sentences**

Now, let’s look at the rest of this paragraph (about individuals influencing governments):

> When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

**Let’s revise for clarity, unity, and coherence.**
- Do these sentences clearly support your improved topic sentence?
- Is the explanation logical and does each detail clearly connect to influencing government?
- Is there any evidence or explanation that could be clarified or expanded?

**Guiding questions:**
1. Is your paragraph focused? Do all examples relate to advocacy, voting, public pressure, or collective action?
2. Are there places where you could use more specific vocabulary, or tighten up your explanations?
3. Does the paragraph include points about possible limitations or challenges? If so, are these clearly connected?

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try revising one or two supporting sentences now?  
Pick a sentence you feel could be clearer or more precise, and share your revised version with me here.

If you need help, I can offer hints or a model phrase—just let me know!

Let’s work through your paragraph step by step, improving clarity and coherence as you revise. Which sentence would you like to start with?

**You:** For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

**Assistant:** Excellent! Let’s work step by step through revising the supporting sentences in this paragraph. You’re making good progress in academic writing—let’s keep focusing on clarity, unity, and coherence.

**Here is the paragraph again for reference:**

> For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

**Let’s start revising, one sentence at a time:**

**You:** For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:20:05.664Z

**Assistant:** Great choice to start with the first supporting sentence! Let’s focus on making it clearer and more formal.

**Original:**  
"For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy."

**Guiding Questions:**
- How do actions like protesting or voting lead to real policy changes?
- Can you use more precise academic language (e.g., "public demonstrations," "elected officials," "implement environmental regulations")?
- Are you clearly linking these actions to the idea of influencing government policies?

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try rephrasing this sentence?  
Aim for something like:  
“Through public demonstrations or by voting for environmentally-focused politicians, citizens can encourage governments to enact effective environmental policies such as pollution bans or investments in clean energy.”

Please give your revised sentence a try! I’ll offer feedback and help you refine it, or we can move on to the next sentence when you’re ready.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:20:14.452Z

**You:** Through public demonstrations or by voting for environmentally-focused politicians, citizens can encourage governments to enact effective environmental policies such as pollution bans or investments in clean energy.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:20:40.736Z

**Assistant:** Well done! Your revised sentence is much more academic and precise. Let’s review your changes:

**Strengths:**
- You clearly mention "public demonstrations" and "voting for environmentally-focused politicians," which is strong and specific.
- You use formal, topic-specific vocabulary like "enact," "effective environmental policies," "pollution bans," and "investments in clean energy."
- The sentence directly supports your topic sentence about individuals influencing government through collective action and advocacy.

**Suggestions:**
- To make the cause and effect relationship even clearer, you could use language like "can help" or "often helps" (instead of only "can"), which is slightly less absolute, but this is optional depending on your style and the evidence you plan to provide.
- Make sure you maintain this academic and precise tone throughout the paragraph.

**Next Step:**  
Are you satisfied with this version of the sentence?  
If yes, let’s move to revising the next supporting sentence:

Original:
"In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions."

Would you like to try revising this one, using more formal vocabulary (for example, “organized campaigns” instead of “joined together,” “influenced policymakers” instead of “forced their leaders”)?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:24:46.060Z

**You:** In more developed countries, there have been organized campaigns that aims to influence policymakers. These actions have led to legislators to introduce new regulations about cutting down plastic and carbon emissions.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:26:52.619Z

**Assistant:** Excellent progress! You’re using more topic-specific, academic vocabulary, and your explanation is clearer. Let’s look at your revised sentences one at a time:

---

**1. Sentence 1:**  
"In more developed countries, there have been organized campaigns that aims to influence policymakers."

- **Strengths**:  
  - You specify "organized campaigns" and their purpose—very good!
  - "Influence policymakers" is clear and academic.

- **Suggestions**:  
  - Use the correct verb form (“campaigns that aim…” instead of “aims”).
  - It may help to mention that citizens organize these campaigns for environmental change.

**Hint**: You could say, “In many developed countries, citizens have organized campaigns to influence policymakers on environmental issues.” Would you like to adjust the verb tense or add more detail?

---

**2. Sentence 2:**  
"These actions have led to legislators to introduce new regulations about cutting down plastic and carbon emissions."

- **Strengths**:  
  - You link campaigns to the outcome—new regulations!
  - “introduce new regulations about cutting down plastic and carbon emissions” is topic-specific.

- **Suggestions**:  
  - “led to legislators to introduce” needs correcting (“led legislators to introduce…” or “have resulted in the introduction of…”).
  - Be precise: “regulations reducing plastic use and carbon emissions” or "regulations on plastic reduction and emission control" for academic tone.

**Hint**: Try “These efforts have resulted in new laws aimed at reducing plastic use and limiting carbon emissions.” Would you like to revise for grammar and clarity?

---

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try revising either sentence based on these suggestions?  
Focus on verb agreement and academic phrasing.

**You:** In more developed countries, the citizens have organized campaigns that aims to influence policymakers on environmental issues. These actions have led legislators to introduce new regulations about reducing plastic use and carbon emissions.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:28:11.548Z

**Assistant:** Excellent progress! Your revised sentences are much clearer and use strong academic vocabulary. Let’s review them and make a few final tweaks for correctness and style:

---

**Your revised sentences:**  
1. *In more developed countries, the citizens have organized campaigns that aims to influence policymakers on environmental issues.*  
2. *These actions have led legislators to introduce new regulations about reducing plastic use and carbon emissions.*

---

**Feedback and guidance:**

- **Subject-verb agreement:**  
  - "citizens have organized campaigns that aim..." (not "aims," because "campaigns" is plural)
- **Definite article:**  
  - In most contexts, "citizens" works well without "the" unless you are referring to a specific group previously mentioned.

- **Clarity and conciseness:**  
  - The second sentence is clear and academic. Well done!

---

**Refined versions (for guidance only):**

1. "In more developed countries, citizens have organized campaigns that aim to influence policymakers on environmental issues."
2. "These actions have led legislators to introduce new regulations for reducing plastic use and carbon emissions."

---

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to adjust the verb form in sentence one ("aim" instead of "aims")?  
Do you feel the sentences now express your ideas clearly, with correct grammar and academic vocabulary?

If so, let’s move to the next supporting sentence in your paragraph!

**Next Step:**  
The original sentence is:  
"This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power."

Would you like to revise this for clarity and academic tone?  
Try using phrases like "collective action" and "significant policy changes."  
For example: "This demonstrates how collective action enables significant environmental policy shifts, even when individual power is limited."

**Assistant:** Great work on revising those supporting sentences—you’re expressing your ideas with strong, academic language and clear connections.

Now, let’s focus on the next sentence in your paragraph:

**Original:**  
"This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power."

**Guidance and suggestions:**

- Use more formal terms:  
  - Instead of "normal people," use "citizens" or "the public."
  - Replace "have a big effect" with "influence significant policy changes" or "create meaningful impact."
- Clearly link the sentence to your paragraph focus on collective action.

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try rewriting this sentence, using a more academic and precise tone?

**Assistant:** Excellent work! You’ve successfully revised your thesis statement, topic sentence, and supporting sentences with clear connections, academic vocabulary, and strong coherence. This shows a great understanding of essay structure and critical analysis.

**Final step in this paragraph:**  
Let’s look at your last two sentences, which discuss the limitations of individual influence:

> "But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen."

**Feedback and Guidance:**
- Use precise, academic language (e.g., "governments may not respond strongly to public pressure").
- Clarify the challenges citizens face—such as limited political engagement or lack of communication channels.
- Clearly relate your point to the overall argument.

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to revise one or both of these sentences now?  
Consider something like:  
"However, government response to public pressure is not always sufficient, and citizens may encounter challenges in effectively communicating their concerns to policymakers."

Try adapting this idea in your own words. When you’re ready, share your revision for these final sentences!
