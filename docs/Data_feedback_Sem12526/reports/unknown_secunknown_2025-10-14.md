### Recommendations for Your Next Steps

1. **Engage Actively with AI:**  
   When working with AI tools, try to have a back-and-forth conversation. For example, ask the AI to explain why a suggestion is made or request alternative phrasing. This will help you understand the reasoning behind edits and develop critical thinking.

2. **Focus on Grammar Practice:**  
   Use targeted grammar exercises or ask the AI to identify and explain specific grammar errors in your writing. Request examples and practice rewriting sentences to internalize correct structures.

3. **Plan Your Essay Structure:**  
   Before writing or revising, brainstorm and outline your essay’s main points and how they connect. Ask the AI to help you create a clear roadmap with logical transitions to improve coherence.

4. **Document Your Revision Process:**  
   Keep track of your interactions with AI—note what suggestions you received, which you accepted or rejected, and why. This reflection will help you become a more strategic and independent editor.

Climate change, it is very huge problem now. I think individual actions not so important like what government and big companies do. But still, I kinda disagree because people also can do stuff to help. I will explain my thoughts here.

First, governments and companies, they got more power. They can do big things. Like, government make laws for no pollution. They can stop plastic bags or tell factories to not make so much smoke. Companies also can change their ways. They can use less energy or make stuff that don't hurt environment. This is good because it change many people life at once. So powerful, you know.

But individual actions, they matter too, I guess. If many people do little things, it add up. Like, turn off lights at home save energy. Or buy things from green companies. Then companies think, oh, we must be green to sell more. But sometimes it hard to know if this really work. People don't always do it. Also, one person doing something. It not enough.

Another thing. When people change their life, like stop using car and walk, government see this. Politicians want votes, so they make rules people like. So individual action can push government to do more. Maybe start big movement. But I not sure how many people need to do this for it to work. Just thinking.

Some say individual action too small. One person cannot fix climate change. True, but if million people try, maybe it help. Every small thing count. Or not? I don't know sometimes.

Anyway, I think both individual and government and companies must work. Individual action seem small but if many do it, it big. We need all to fix this problem. Climate change very bad, so everyone must try hard. That's my opinion.

Climate change has become an extremely pressing global issue today. While I believe individual actions are far less impactful than those taken by governments and large corporations, I still hold a conflicting view—individuals can also contribute their share to address it. Below is my detailed explanation.
First, governments and companies, they got more power. They can do big things. Like, government make laws for no pollution. They can stop plastic bags or tell factories to not make so much smoke. Companies also can change their ways. They can use less energy or make stuff that don't hurt environment. This is good because it change many people life at once. So powerful, you know.

But individual actions, they matter too, I guess. If many people do little things, it add up. Like, turn off lights at home save energy. Or buy things from green companies. Then companies think, oh, we must be green to sell more. But sometimes it hard to know if this really work. People don't always do it. Also, one person doing something. It not enough.

Another thing. When people change their life, like stop using car and walk, government see this. Politicians want votes, so they make rules people like. So individual action can push government to do more. Maybe start big movement. But I not sure how many people need to do this for it to work. 

Some argue that individual actions are too trivial—after all, a single person can never fix climate change. That’s true, but if millions of people join hands to take action, their combined efforts may well make a difference. Do all these small deeds really count? I sometimes find myself wondering.

Anyway, I believe individuals, governments, and companies must all work together. Individual actions may seem trivial on their own, but when millions of people take them, they add up to something significant. We need everyone’s effort to solve this problem—climate change is so severe that every single one of us must try our hardest. That’s my opinion.
