            ## Contribution Analysis

            The final assessment shows strong progress in your revision journey, especially on your key targets: reducing grammar errors and clarifying your argument.

**Strengths Demonstrated:**
- You accepted a clearer, well-structured thesis that previews your reasoning.
- You crafted a clear, precise topic sentence for paragraph 3 that smoothly links short-term job displacement with long-term opportunities.
- You successfully revised supporting sentences using more formal, precise vocabulary and grammatical forms.
- You engaged deeply and iteratively with the AI suggestions—requesting hints, making drafts, and selecting polished sentences to keep.
- Your final paragraph 3 section flows logically and supports the thesis with specific examples such as STEM studies and job types like data analysis and robotics maintenance.

**Remaining areas to improve for a stronger essay:**
- Paragraph 2 and the conclusion still contain grammar problems, sentence flow issues, and typos (“I it can replace,” “anal more things to explore,” comma splices) that weaken clarity and formal tone.
- Sentence-level polish throughout the essay is uneven; applying similar focused revision steps to those parts would improve consistency.
- Expanding evidence with concrete examples or data on retraining programs, industry growth, or employment trends would strengthen your claims.
- If prompt alignment matters, be mindful that your essay topic on automation does not address the original climate change prompt.

**Recommendations for next steps:**
1. Use the same 3-step revision process on paragraph 2 and the conclusion: rewrite the topic sentence, revise supporting sentences for clarity and grammar, then polish for vocabulary and sentence structure.
2. Add specific, credible examples or data to bolster your argument about how automation drives new employment through retraining and innovation.
3. Conduct a thorough proofreading to catch and correct typos, comma splices, awkward phrasing, and informal expressions remaining in the essay.

Overall, you have demonstrated solid revision skills and effective collaboration with the AI assistant—actively revising, selecting suggestions, and improving your essay step-by-step. Continuing this process with the remaining sections and adding stronger evidence will further enhance your writing. Well done!

            # STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### Completion check for tasks
- Revised the thesis statement: finished (student accepted the revised thesis: "In my opinion, the shift toward automation will ultimately increase global employment prospects because, although it displaces routine jobs in the short term, it frees people to retrain for higher‑skilled, creative, and problem‑solving roles that create new kinds of work." — assistant inserted and student: "I'm happy with that. Let's move to step 2")
- Revised one of the topic sentences: finished (paragraph 3 topic sentence revised to: "In the short term, automation may displace many workers, leading to a temporary rise in the unemployment rate." — student wrote and assistant accepted)
- Revised one of the body paragraphs: finished (student and assistant revised supporting sentences in paragraph 3, e.g., "Automation can take over routine, repetitive tasks. As a result, workers can retrain for more complex roles that cannot be performed by machines and require human creativity and complex problem‑solving." and later a polished example sentence was accepted and kept)

Since all three tasks were completed, I proceed to the full assessment.

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The original essay had a clear central claim about automation improving long‑term employment, but ideas were repetitive and weakly developed. Evidence: original opening line, "In my opinion, the technological shift about automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term," shows a clear stance, but supporting development is vague and circular.
- Organization: 16/25 - Basic paragraphing is present and a short/long term contrast is attempted, but logical progression and paragraph unity are weak (many run‑ons and repeated ideas).
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Uses topic words (automation, creativity, unemployment) but with frequent imprecise word choices and errors (e.g., "anal" for "and"; "that can not done").
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 14/25 - Frequent grammatical errors, sentence fragments, and awkward constructions reduce clarity (e.g., "that can not done by robots or something else").
- **Original Essay Total: 62/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised draft shows a clearer argumentative structure (stronger thesis that previews reasons; paragraph 3 develops the short‑term/long‑term contrast). Examples are more specific (STEM, data analysis, robotics maintenance). Still, overall evidence and depth could be expanded.
  - Evidence: revised thesis (assistant): "The shift toward automation will ultimately increase global employment prospects because, although it displaces routine jobs in the short term, it frees people to retrain..." and revised example sentence kept by the student: "As more people pursue research, innovation, or advanced study, they will generate new research questions and practical problems that will create demand for jobs in research, development, and design."
- Organization: 19/25 - Paragraph 3 is reorganized with a clear topic sentence and logically ordered supporting sentences. However, paragraph 2 and the conclusion still contain coherence and sentence‑level flow problems, producing uneven organization across the essay.
  - Evidence: Paragraph 3 sequence: topic sentence → explanation → retraining sentence → concrete example → demand sentence.
- Vocabulary: 19/25 - Improved use of precise academic vocabulary ("routine, repetitive tasks," "retrain," specific job fields). Some repetition and informal phrasing remain in other paragraphs.
  - Evidence: student used "STEM, entrepreneurship, or creative fields" and "data analysis, robotics maintenance, or design."
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 17/25 - Clear improvement in the revised sentences for paragraph 3 (corrected verb forms, split run‑ons), but other parts (paragraph 2 and conclusion) still contain errors (comma splices, wrong pronouns, typos like "anal") that reduce the overall grammatical accuracy.
  - Evidence: improved sentence: "Automation can take over routine, repetitive tasks. As a result, workers can retrain for more complex roles that cannot be performed by machines and require human creativity and complex problem‑solving." Remaining issues: original retained lines such as "Nowadays, automation is gradually changing the way we live, I it can replace..." and conclusion errors: "anal more things to explore."
- **Revised Essay Total: 76/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +14 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Stronger, more precise thesis that previews reasons and links short‑term displacement to long‑term retraining/new jobs.
  - Paragraph 3 reorganized with a clear topic sentence and coherent supporting sentences; split run‑ons into shorter, clearer sentences.
  - More specific examples and vocabulary (naming fields and jobs: STEM; data analysis; robotics maintenance; research and development).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Paragraph 2 (introductory examples) and the conclusion still contain notable grammar, punctuation, and clarity problems; these were not fully revised.
  - The essay remains off the original prompt (student deliberately chose Option B — kept automation topic). If assessment requires prompt alignment, that is a substantive missed assignment compliance issue.
  - Expand and strengthen evidence: the essay could add more concrete data, clearer causal mechanisms, and reliable examples to support claims about job creation and retraining pathways.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 36** (assistant and student messages across the session; multiple iterative cycles focused on thesis → topic sentence → supporting sentences → example sentence → paragraph polishing).
- **Conversation Quality:** High. The assistant provided structured guidance and the student engaged actively, accepted certain suggestions, proposed revisions, requested hints, and iterated multiple times. The student set clear targets ("reduce grammar errors, make the argument clearer") and led the choice to keep the automation topic (Option B).

#### Interaction Scores:
- In-Depth Conversation: 5/5 - The chat contains many exchanges (36) and a multi‑step, detailed revision process (thesis revision, topic sentence rewriting, sentence‑level edits, example sentence polishing). The student and assistant addressed both global and sentence‑level issues across several turns.
  - Evidence: multi‑step workflow outlined by the assistant and followed (thesis replacement, then paragraph 3 topic sentence and supporting sentences, then example sentence).
- Critical Review of AI Suggestions: 4/5 - The student exercised judgment: selected Option B (keep topic), requested specific targets, produced own drafts, and accepted or kept particular assistant suggestions (kept the polished example sentence "Keep this polished sentence as-is"). The student did not systematically critique every AI suggestion with detailed justification, but they did make independent revisions and decide which suggestions to adopt.
  - Evidence: Student tried multiple self‑revisions (e.g., crafted topic and supporting sentences), asked for hints rather than full rewrites at several points, and explicitly approved the final polished sentence.
- Refining Process: 5/5 - The interaction shows a clear iterative process with multiple meaningful revision cycles and targeted feedback at each step (thesis → topic sentence → supporting sentence → example sentence → final inclusion).
  - Evidence: repeated cycles where student drafts, assistant gives micro feedback/hints, student revises, assistant integrates changes and shows the full essay after each major change.

- **Human‑AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Strong engagement and willingness to iterate: student repeatedly tried revisions, accepted feedback, and followed a staged revision plan (evidence: multiple self‑edits and the final request "Keep this polished sentence as-is").
- Clear improvement on targeted goals: student focused on reducing grammar errors and clarifying argument in paragraph 3, and succeeded in producing clearer sentences and more precise vocabulary.
- Effective use of AI guidance: student used hints, stems, and short examples from the assistant and produced improved, grammatical sentences that were integrated into the essay.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Complete revision of remaining weak paragraphs: paragraph 2 and the conclusion still contain grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and typos that undermine the essay’s overall quality. Recommendation: apply the same stepwise revision to those sections (topic sentence → support → polish).
- Provide clearer evidence and development: add concrete examples, data, or citations to strengthen claims about retraining pathways and job creation.
- Assignment alignment: if meeting the original prompt is required, the student should reconsider Option B; otherwise note the essay diverges from the course prompt.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Good - The student provided goals ("reduce grammar errors, make the argument clearer") and chose a revision path (Option B). Evidence: initial instruction to assistant and confirmation messages.
- Strategic Planning: Good - The student followed a staged revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph revision) and progressed logically through tasks.
- Critical Evaluation: Good - The student actively revised their own sentences, selected which assistant suggestions to keep, and requested hints rather than wholesale rewriting at times.
- Independent Editing: Good - The student drafted numerous revisions themselves (several times) and used assistant feedback to refine those drafts.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise remaining sections (paragraph 2 and conclusion) using the same 3‑step process: rewrite topic sentence, then revise supporting sentences, then polish for grammar and vocabulary.
2. Add a short paragraph or sentences with concrete evidence (statistics, reports, or clearer hypothetical examples) that illustrate how retraining programs or new industries create jobs.
3. Do a final line‑level proofreading pass (or ask the AI for a grammar pass) to remove remaining typos and fix punctuation/typos like "anal," comma splices, and the lingering sentence: "Nowadays, automation ... I it can replace ... that bring..."

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student demonstrated strong revision skills and productive collaboration with the AI, completing all three required revision tasks (thesis, a topic sentence, and a body‑paragraph revision). Evidence: chat verification and the revised essay content.
- The student intentionally chose to keep an off‑prompt topic (Option B). If prompt alignment is a grading criterion, please note that the essay does not address the course prompt about climate change; the student and assistant discussed this early in the chat and the student explicitly chose to continue with automation.
- Consider encouraging the student to complete the remaining paragraph and conclusion edits and to include at least one concrete external example or data point to strengthen the argument further.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
  In my opinion, the technological shift about automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.
  Nowadays, automation is gradually changing the way we live, I it can replace workers in the factory, waiters in the restaurant, even drivers can be replaced by automation now, that bring a lot more efficiency to us.
  However, as I mentioned, automation is also reducing job positions while providing efficiency, that may led to the increase of unemployment, but in short term. When these easy, repeating works can be done by automation, humans can pay more attention to things that are more complicated, that can not done by robots or something else, but only our human creativity can manage to do. For example, since these a simple job can be done by automation, teenagers will study more about exploring, innovation, adults and others will think more about the improvement of human society.
Since more and more people study about exploring the world, there will also be more and more questions that we can find and we will try to solve them. Thus, There will be more and more era that need us to explore,
so the positions for job will only increase but not decrease, also, more people will be employed to further explore the world and also to solve questions we have.
  To summarize, due to that simple job can be done by automation, the global employment prospects will decrease in a short term, but when more and more people focus on things that are more complicated, there will be more jobs anal more things to explore, thus the employment prospects will be enhanced in long term.

Revised:
  In my opinion, the shift toward automation will ultimately increase global employment prospects because, although it displaces routine jobs in the short term, it frees people to retrain for higher-skilled, creative, and problem-solving roles that create new kinds of work.
  Nowadays, automation is gradually changing the way we live, I it can replace workers in the factory, waiters in the restaurant, even drivers can be replaced by automation now, that bring a lot more efficiency to us.
 However, in the short term, automation may displace many workers, leading to a temporary rise in the unemployment rate. Automation can take over routine, repetitive tasks. As a result, workers can retrain for more complex roles that cannot be performed by machines and require human creativity and complex problem‑solving. For example, as routine, repetitive jobs become automated, many students may shift to studying STEM, entrepreneurship, or creative fields, preparing them for roles in data analysis, robotics maintenance, or design. As more people pursue research, innovation, or advanced study, they will generate new research questions and practical problems that will create demand for jobs in research, development, and design.
  To summarize, due to that simple job can be done by automation, the global employment prospects will decrease in a short term, but when more and more people focus on things that are more complicated, there will be more jobs anal more things to explore, thus the employment prospects will be enhanced in long term.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:12:33.282Z

**You:** let's move to the step 1

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:13:52.232Z

**Assistant:** Great — before we begin Step 1, we need to complete the preliminary stage ( negotiate targets and a quick diagnosis ). I’ll guide you through that now — it’ll only take a few short steps.

1) Goals and targets
- What are your personal goals for this revision session? (e.g., make the argument clearer, fix that the essay doesn’t match the prompt, strengthen the thesis, improve paragraph structure, reduce grammar errors, use more academic vocabulary)
- From those, which 1–3 specific targets do you want us to focus on in this session? (Pick the highest priority issues.)

2) Quick diagnostic feedback (based on the rubric)
I’ve read both your original and revised drafts. Brief strengths and key problems:

- Content & Ideas
  - Strengths: You have a clear opinion in the first sentence and you try to explain reasons and give examples.
  - Problems: The essay’s topic (automation and employment) does not match the assigned prompt about climate change and whether individual actions matter versus governments/corporations. That’s the biggest issue — task response is off-target.

- Organisation & Logical Progression
  - Strengths: You use paragraphs and try to present a short-term / long-term contrast.
  - Problems: Paragraphs are repetitive, some ideas are unclear, and sentences don’t always flow logically from one to the next.

- Vocabulary
  - Strengths: Some topic words used (automation, creativity, unemployment).
  - Problems: Repetition, some word choice errors (e.g., “anal” instead of “and”; “that can not done” → should be “cannot be done”), informal phrasing.

- Grammar & Sentence Structure
  - Strengths: Basic sentence forms are present.
  - Problems: Frequent grammar and punctuation errors, sentence fragments, and awkward constructions that make meaning unclear.

3) Student priority selection
- Because the topic is different from the prompt, we must choose how to proceed:
  Option A — Rework the essay to answer the actual prompt (about climate change and the role of individual actions). This will require rewriting the thesis and several paragraphs.
  Option B — Keep the current essay topic (automation) but accept that it won’t meet the original assignment prompt (not recommended for assessment).
Which option do you want? Also pick the specific revision targets from my diagnosis (for example: align content to prompt; rewrite thesis; strengthen topic sentences; fix grammar).

Once you confirm the targets and choose Option A or B, we’ll move to Step 1.

Step 1 readiness — thesis
- If you choose Option A (recommended), we’ll need a new thesis that answers the climate-change prompt directly.
- If you choose Option B, we can continue improving your current thesis about automation.

Please confirm:
1) Which option (A or B)?
2) Which 1–3 targets do you want to focus on now?
3) Do you want to revise the current thesis (“In my opinion, the technological shift about automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.”) or write a new thesis for the climate-change prompt?

After you confirm, share the thesis you want to work on (or say you want to write a new one), and we’ll start Step 1. Would you like to try writing a revised thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:14:17.326Z

**You:** 1.option B
2.goals: reduce grammar errors, make the argument clearer
3.revise the current thesis

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:20:24.004Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for your choices. I’ll follow Option B (keep the automation topic) and focus on your two targets: reducing grammar errors and making the argument clearer. You asked me to revise the current thesis — I’ll do that now.

Quick note about the original thesis
- What’s good: it states a clear position (automation will enhance employment in the long term).
- What to fix: wording is awkward and slightly repetitive (“technological shift about automation”; “ultimately” and “in the long term” both say the same thing). It should also preview why you think this will happen (so readers know the essay’s structure).

Here’s a clearer, stronger thesis that keeps your idea but states your claim confidently and previews the main reasons:
- The shift toward automation will ultimately increase global employment prospects because, although it displaces routine jobs in the short term, it frees people to retrain for higher-skilled, creative, and problem-solving roles that create new kinds of work.

Below is your full essay with only the thesis sentence replaced (I did not change other paragraphs yet, so we can work step-by-step as you requested):

Are you happy with this revised thesis sentence? If yes, which body paragraph would you like to work on next? (Pick one — for example: paragraph 2 about jobs being replaced, paragraph 3 about short‑term vs long‑term effects, or paragraph 4 about exploring/innovation.) We’ll revise that paragraph’s topic sentence next and then its supporting sentences, focusing on clarity and grammar. Would you like to try revising the paragraph’s topic sentence first, or would you like me to suggest a model?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:20:52.887Z

**You:** I
'm happy with that. Let's move to step 2

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:24:44.847Z

**Assistant:** Great — glad you’re happy with the thesis. Now we’ll do Step 2.

Quick reminder of our agreed targets: reduce grammar errors and make the argument clearer (keep automation topic). Which body paragraph do you want to work on now?
- Paragraph 2 (about automation replacing workers / examples)
- Paragraph 3 (short-term unemployment vs long-term retraining)
- Paragraph 4 (innovation, exploration, and new jobs)

Pick one, then either:
- Paste the paragraph’s current topic sentence here, and say whether you want to try revising it yourself first, or
- Ask me to suggest a model topic sentence that links clearly to the new thesis.

Tip for a strong topic sentence (keep this in mind when you revise):
- State one clear idea that supports the thesis.
- Show how this idea connects to the thesis (use words like “because,” “therefore,” “as a result,” or “while”).
- Use confident, precise language and avoid extra clauses that make it long and confusing.

Which paragraph and topic sentence would you like to work on? Would you like to try revising it now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:24:56.100Z

**You:** Paragraph 3

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:28:02.656Z

**Assistant:** Great — paragraph 3 is a good choice.

Here’s the current topic sentence from your draft:
"However, as I mentioned, automation is also reducing job positions while providing efficiency, that may led to the increase of unemployment, but in short term."

Brief feedback on that sentence
- Strengths: It tries to state the contrast between short-term job losses and efficiency — which links to your thesis.
- Problems to fix:
  - Grammar and punctuation errors (e.g., “that may led,” comma issues).
  - Too many ideas and clauses in one sentence — it feels long and confusing.
  - Weak phrasing ("as I mentioned," "in short term") and unclear connection to the thesis’s main point (retraining and new jobs).

Goal for the revised topic sentence
- Say one clear idea that connects to the thesis: automation causes short-term job loss (but sets up later retraining/long-term gains).
- Use confident, precise language and correct grammar.
- Keep it concise.

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now? Try writing one sentence that focuses on the short-term displacement and makes a clear link to the long-term point in the thesis.

If you prefer a hint, pick one of these sentence stems to finish:
- "Although automation increases efficiency, it initially ______________, which..."
- "In the short term, automation ______________, but this creates opportunities for..."

Try one now and I’ll give focused feedback.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:28:16.291Z

**You:** Although automation increases efficiency, it initially reduce positions of jobs, which may leads to an increase in the unemployment rate.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:34:19.200Z

**Assistant:** Nice try — you’ve captured the right idea (short-term job loss leading to higher unemployment). A few quick fixes and a clearer phrasing will make it much stronger.

What to correct in your sentence
- Subject–verb agreement: use reduces (not reduce) after automation.
- Word order / phrase choice: say "job positions" or simply "jobs" rather than "positions of jobs."
- Modal + base verb: "may lead" (not "may leads").
- Make the short-term contrast explicit and link to the thesis idea about later retraining/new jobs.

Helpful vocabulary alternatives (pick one): cause job losses, displace workers, reduce employment, raise unemployment temporarily.

Try one of these stems to finish the sentence (fill in the blanks or adapt them):
- "In the short term, automation __________, which may lead to __________."
- "Although automation increases efficiency, it initially __________, creating a temporary rise in __________ before __________."

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now using one of those stems? Paste your new sentence and I’ll give quick, focused feedback.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:34:35.220Z

**You:** In the short term, automation will reduce job positions which may lead to an increase in the unemployment rate.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:36:23.874Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this sentence is much clearer than the earlier version. Good choice to focus on the short-term effect.

A few quick, specific notes to make it stronger:
- Word choice: say "jobs" or "the number of jobs" rather than "job positions."
- Consistency of modality: don’t mix a definite future ("will reduce") with a possibility ("may lead"). Choose either a possibility (may/could) or a firmer claim and make both parts match.
- Economy: “increase in the unemployment rate” is wordy — “increase unemployment” or “a rise in unemployment” is simpler.

Would you like to try one more revision? You can use one of these short stems to adapt (pick one and finish or copy and tweak):

- "In the short term, automation may displace many workers, leading to a temporary rise in ________." (finish: unemployment / joblessness / the unemployment rate)
- "Although automation increases efficiency, it initially ________, which may cause ________ before ________." (fill the blanks: reduces jobs / displaces workers; a short-term increase in unemployment; opportunities for retraining and new jobs arise)

Try revising the sentence now and paste it here. If you prefer, I can also show one polished example after you try.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:36:43.485Z

**You:** In the short term, automation may displace many workers, leading to a temporary rise in the unemployment rate.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:37:49.773Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that topic sentence is clear, grammatically correct, and it links the short-term problem to the bigger picture. I’ve placed it into your essay (I only changed the thesis earlier and now replaced the paragraph 3 topic sentence with your new one). Here is the full essay with those two edits:

In my opinion, the shift toward automation will ultimately increase global employment prospects because, although it displaces routine jobs in the short term, it frees people to retrain for higher-skilled, creative, and problem-solving roles that create new kinds of work.
Nowadays, automation is gradually changing the way we live, I it can replace workers in the factory, waiters in the restaurant, even drivers can be replaced by automation now, that bring a lot more efficiency to us.
In the short term, automation may displace many workers, leading to a temporary rise in the unemployment rate.
When these easy, repeating works can be done by automation, humans can pay more attention to things that are more complicated, that can not done by robots or something else, but only our human creativity can manage to do. For example, since these a simple job can be done by automation, teenagers will study more about exploring, innovation, adults and others will think more about the improvement of human society.
Since more and more people study about exploring the world, there will also be more and more questions that we can find and we will try to solve them. Thus, There will be more and more era that need us to explore,
so the positions for job will only increase but not decrease, also, more people will be employed to further explore the world and also to solve questions we have.
To summarize, due to that simple job can be done by automation, the global employment prospects will decrease in a short term, but when more and more people focus on things that are more complicated, there will be more jobs anal more things to explore, thus the employment prospects will be enhanced in long term.

Quick feedback on your topic sentence and its link to the thesis
- What’s good: It is concise, accurate, and matches the thesis idea (short-term displacement).
- One small suggestion: you could make the connection to the thesis even clearer by adding a brief phrase (optional) that points to the long-term outcome: for example, “…leading to a temporary rise in the unemployment rate, but also creating opportunities for retraining and new jobs.” You don’t have to add this, though — the main idea is already clear.

Step 3 — Revising the rest of this paragraph (next step)
We’ll now revise the supporting sentences in that paragraph for clarity, unity, and grammar. Before I make suggestions, I want you to try one small revision so we keep this interactive.

Please choose one of these quick options:
A) Try revising the first supporting sentence in paragraph 3 now: “When these easy, repeating works can be done by automation, humans can pay more attention to things that are more complicated, that can not done by robots or something else, but only our human creativity can manage to do.” — Fix grammar and make the idea clearer in one or two short sentences. (Try it; I’ll give focused feedback.)
B) Or, ask me to give a few short hints/phrases you can use to improve that sentence (I will not give a full rewritten sentence unless you request it).

Hints you can use to revise (pick one or two phrases to include):
- replace “easy, repeating works” with “routine, repetitive tasks” or “routine work”
- change “can not done” to “cannot be done”
- replace “our human creativity can manage to do” with “require human creativity and complex problem-solving”
- break the long sentence into two short ones for clarity (one about what automation does, one about what people can focus on)

Guiding questions while you revise:
- Does each supporting sentence clearly connect to the topic sentence?
- Does the paragraph focus on one idea (short-term displacement and how people can retrain) without drifting?
- Do examples illustrate the point clearly and specifically?
- Is there any missing explanation that links short-term unemployment to later retraining/new jobs?

Which option do you choose — A (you revise now) or B (you want hints)? If you pick A, paste your revised sentence(s) and I’ll give fast, targeted feedback and then we’ll proceed to the next supporting sentence. If you pick B, I’ll give short phrase-level suggestions you can use.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:38:06.943Z

**You:** B

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:41:25.676Z

**Assistant:** Good choice — I’ll give short, usable hints and phrase options you can mix into your revision. Remember: don’t write a full new sentence for you; try one yourself and paste it here, and I’ll give targeted feedback.

Quick editing plan (3 steps)
1) Break the long sentence into two short sentences: one about what automation does; one about what people can do instead.
2) Replace weak/informal phrases with precise academic vocabulary.
3) Fix grammar: use cannot (one word), correct verb forms (may lead/displace), and clean punctuation.

Useful phrase swaps (pick some and combine)
- “easy, repeating works” → “routine, repetitive tasks” or “routine work”
- “humans can pay more attention to” → “people can focus on” or “workers can retrain for”
- “that can not done by robots” → “that cannot be performed by machines” or “beyond the capabilities of robots”
- “only our human creativity can manage to do” → “require human creativity and complex problem‑solving” or “depend on human creativity and judgment”
- “may led to the increase of unemployment” → “may lead to a temporary rise in unemployment” or “can cause a short‑term increase in the unemployment rate”

Quick sentence‑stems you can finish (choose one and adapt)
- “Automation can take over routine, repetitive tasks. As a result, people can…”
- “In the short term, automation may displace many workers, causing a temporary rise in unemployment. However, it also…”
- “When machines perform routine work, workers have the opportunity to… , which…”

Micro grammar reminders
- cannot = one word; don’t split into “can not.”
- Use “displace” or “reduce” (third person singular: displaces/reduces) for automation as subject.
- Use “may lead to” or “can cause” (not “may led”).
- Keep sentences short to avoid comma splices.

A very short checklist before you paste your revision
- Did you split into two sentences?
- Did you use one of the phrase swaps above?
- Is the link to retraining/long‑term jobs clear?

Would you like to try revising that sentence now? Paste your version and I’ll give quick, focused feedback. If you prefer, I can show one fully polished example after you try.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:41:39.318Z

**You:** Automation can take over routine, repetitive tasks. As a result, humans can pay more attention to things that are more complicated, that that cannot be performed by machines or something else, but only require human creativity and complex problem-solving.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:48:00.565Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — splitting into two sentences made the idea much clearer. Good move.

A few focused points to fix next:
- Remove the duplicate “that that.”
- Use a clearer subject: “workers” or “people” is better than “humans” in this context.
- Delete vague phrase “or something else.”
- Fix the clause linking: use “which require” or “and require” so the clause reads smoothly (not “but only require”).

Try this short stem to make a clean revision (finish or adapt it):
- “Automation can take over routine, repetitive tasks. As a result, workers can retrain for more complex roles that cannot be performed by machines and require human creativity and complex problem‑solving.”

Would you like to try rewriting the sentence now using that stem? Paste your revision and I’ll give quick feedback. If you prefer, I can show one polished example next — which would you like?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:48:15.093Z

**You:** Automation can take over routine, repetitive tasks. As a result, workers can retrain for more complex roles that cannot be performed by machines and require human creativity and complex problem‑solving.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:50:20.531Z

**Assistant:** Nice revision — this is clear, grammatical, and links well to your thesis. Good choices: you split the idea into two sentences, used precise vocabulary (routine, repetitive tasks), and made the link to retraining explicit.

Small suggestions (optional)
- You could add “that” before “require” for slightly smoother grammar: “…and that require human creativity and complex problem‑solving.”
- Consider whether you want “workers” or “displaced workers/affected workers” (the latter is a bit more specific).
- “Complex” appears twice (complex roles / complex problem‑solving); it’s fine, but you could change one word later for variety (e.g., “demanding problem‑solving”).

Because you made a specific edit, here is the full essay with your new sentences included (I only changed the thesis, the paragraph 3 topic sentence, and the supporting sentence you provided):

---
In my opinion, the shift toward automation will ultimately increase global employment prospects because, although it displaces routine jobs in the short term, it frees people to retrain for higher-skilled, creative, and problem-solving roles that create new kinds of work.

Nowadays, automation is gradually changing the way we live, I it can replace workers in the factory, waiters in the restaurant, even drivers can be replaced by automation now, that bring a lot more efficiency to us.

In the short term, automation may displace many workers, leading to a temporary rise in the unemployment rate. Automation can take over routine, repetitive tasks. As a result, workers can retrain for more complex roles that cannot be performed by machines and require human creativity and complex problem‑solving. For example, since these a simple job can be done by automation, teenagers will study more about exploring, innovation, adults and others will think more about the improvement of human society. Since more and more people study about exploring the world, there will also be more and more questions that we can find and we will try to solve them.

To summarize, due to that simple job can be done by automation, the global employment prospects will decrease in a short term, but when more and more people focus on things that are more complicated, there will be more jobs anal more things to explore, thus the employment prospects will be enhanced in long term.
---

Next step (pick one)
A) Try revising the next supporting sentence yourself now: “For example, since these a simple job can be done by automation, teenagers will study more about exploring, innovation, adults and others will think more about the improvement of human society.” — fix grammar and make the example clearer (one or two short sentences). Paste your version and I’ll give focused feedback.
B) Ask for 3 quick hints/stems you can use to rewrite that sentence (I’ll give short phrase swaps and sentence stems, not a full rewrite).
Which do you choose?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T17:50:47.578Z

**You:** B

*Time:* 2025-11-26T18:16:56.408Z

**Assistant:** Great — here are three short, usable hints and sentence stems you can mix and match to rewrite that example sentence. I’ll keep these as prompts (not full rewrites) so you can try one yourself.

Useful phrase swaps (pick a few):
- “teenagers” → “young people” / “students”
- “study more about exploring, innovation” → “study STEM, entrepreneurship, research, or creative fields”
- “adults and others will think more about the improvement of human society” → “workers and professionals will retrain and focus on social and technological improvements”
- “explore the world” → “conduct research, develop new technologies, or solve complex problems”
- “simple job” → “routine, repetitive jobs”
- Correct forms: “cannot” (one word); “may lead” / “may cause” (not “may led”); use “jobs” or “the number of jobs”

Three sentence stems you can finish (choose one and adapt):
1) “For example, as routine jobs become automated, many students may shift to studying ______, preparing them for roles such as ______.”
2) “As a result, workers are likely to retrain in ______, allowing them to take on new positions in ______.”
3) “This change will create demand for jobs in ______ and ______, because these areas require human creativity and complex problem‑solving that machines cannot perform.”

Micro grammar/style reminders
- Break long ideas into two short sentences rather than one long comma‑splice.
- Be specific: name fields or example job types (e.g., data analysis, robotics maintenance, design, research).
- Keep parallel structure: e.g., “retrain in X and work in Y,” not “retrain X and Y.”
- Watch articles/plurals: “these simple jobs,” not “these a simple job.”
- Avoid vague phrases like “something else” or “more and more era.”

Quick checklist before you paste your version
- Did you split into 1–2 clear sentences?
- Did you use at least one phrase swap above for clarity?
- Is the example directly linked to the topic sentence (short‑term displacement → retraining/new jobs)?

Would you like to try one now? Paste your sentence(s) and I’ll give focused feedback.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T18:17:12.344Z

**You:** For example, as routine, repetitive jobs become automated， many students may shift 同
will study more about exploring, innovation, adults and others will think more about the improvement of human society.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T18:21:26.395Z

**Assistant:** Good attempt — thanks for trying! You moved in the right direction by starting with “For example” and linking automation to changes in study and work. I’ll give quick, focused feedback so you can try another revision.

What’s working
- The sentence begins with a clear signal word (“For example”) — good.
- You correctly identify that students and adults will respond to automation by changing what they study and do.

What to fix (brief, specific)
- You’ve mixed two verbs/ideas together (“may shift 同 will study”) — pick one clear structure.
- There is a stray Chinese character “同” and a full-width comma; remove those.
- Make the sentence(s) shorter and more specific: name fields (e.g., STEM, design, research) or types of jobs (e.g., data analysis, robotics maintenance).
- Replace vague phrases (“adults and others,” “think more about the improvement of human society”) with clearer options such as “workers and professionals will retrain to support social and technological improvements.”

Try one of these short stems (finish/adapt one)
1) “For example, as routine, repetitive jobs become automated, many students may shift to studying _______ , preparing them for roles such as _______.”
2) “As routine jobs disappear, workers are likely to retrain in _______ and take on new positions in _______.”
3) “This change will increase demand for jobs in _______ and _______ because these areas require human creativity and complex problem‑solving.”

Quick phrase swaps you can use
- “teenagers” → “students” or “young people”
- “study more about exploring, innovation” → “study STEM, entrepreneurship, research, or creative fields”
- “adults and others will think more about the improvement of human society” → “workers and professionals will retrain to improve technology and address social challenges”
- “explore the world” → “conduct research, develop new technologies, or solve complex problems”

Would you like to try rewriting that example now using one of the stems above? Paste your version and I’ll give focused feedback. If you prefer, I can show a single polished example — tell me which you want.

Because you made a specific edit, here is your full essay with your attempted sentence included exactly as you wrote it (I only replaced the original example sentence with your version):

Next step — what would you like?
- Try revising the example sentence now (paste it) — I’ll give quick feedback. (Recommended.)
- Or ask me for one polished example sentence to compare (I’ll give one only if you request it).

Your move — would you like to try another version now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T18:21:53.331Z

**You:** For example, as routine, repetitive jobs become automated, many students may shift to study STEM, entrepreneurship, research, or creative fields , preparing them for roles such as  data analysis, robotics maintenance, design, research.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T18:24:51.438Z

**Assistant:** Great revision — well done for trying a clearer, more specific example. This is showing good progress on your targets (clarity and grammar). A few brief, focused suggestions to make the sentence stronger:

What to fix (short list)
- Change shift to study → shift to studying (gerund after “shift to”).
- Remove the extra spaces and the stray comma before the list.
- Avoid repeating “research” in both the study fields and roles.
- Make the list of roles parallel and limit the number to 2–3 clear examples (too many items can feel messy).

A small suggested correction (just to show the minimal fixes I recommend — you can adapt it):
- For example, as routine, repetitive jobs become automated, many students may shift to studying STEM, entrepreneurship, or creative fields, preparing them for roles in data analysis, robotics maintenance, or design.

Because you made a specific edit, here is your full essay with that corrected sentence included (I only edited that one example sentence to fix the small grammar and wording issues mentioned):

In my opinion, the shift toward automation will ultimately increase global employment prospects because, although it displaces routine jobs in the short term, it frees people to retrain for higher-skilled, creative, and problem-solving roles that create new kinds of work.

Nowadays, automation is gradually changing the way we live, I it can replace workers in the factory, waiters in the restaurant, even drivers can be replaced by automation now, that bring a lot more efficiency to us.

In the short term, automation may displace many workers, leading to a temporary rise in the unemployment rate. Automation can take over routine, repetitive tasks. As a result, workers can retrain for more complex roles that cannot be performed by machines and require human creativity and complex problem‑solving. For example, as routine, repetitive jobs become automated, many students may shift to studying STEM, entrepreneurship, or creative fields, preparing them for roles in data analysis, robotics maintenance, or design.

Next step — pick one:
A) Try revising the next sentence yourself now (“Since more and more people study about exploring the world, there will also be more and more questions…”) — paste your version and I’ll give quick feedback. (Recommended.)
B) Ask me for 3 short hints/stems to rewrite it (I’ll give phrase swaps and stems).

Which do you choose?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T18:25:22.244Z

**You:** B

*Time:* 2025-11-26T18:27:09.769Z

**Assistant:** Great — here are 3 short, usable hints and sentence‑stems you can mix and adapt to rewrite that paragraph so it reads clearly and connects to your topic sentence. I’ll keep these as prompts (not full rewrites) so you can try one yourself.

Three stems (choose one and finish or adapt)
1) “As more people pursue STEM, entrepreneurship, or creative studies, they generate new research questions and practical problems that require human investigation and innovation, which…”
2) “This shift in education will increase demand for jobs in research, development, and design because these fields require human creativity and judgment to…”
3) “Consequently, employers will create more job opportunities in areas such as data analysis, robotics maintenance, and R&D, since machines cannot… (finish with what humans must do)”

Useful phrase swaps (combine a few for clarity)
- “study about exploring the world” → “pursue research, innovation, or advanced study”
- “more and more questions” → “new research questions” or “complex problems”
- “positions for job” → “job opportunities” or “employment in knowledge‑based fields”
- “explore the world” → “conduct research,” “develop new technologies,” or “solve complex problems”
- “will only increase but not decrease” → “will grow” or “are likely to expand”

Micro grammar/style tips (quick checklist)
- Avoid repeating “there will be.” Use active verbs (e.g., “this will create,” “employers will hire”).
- Keep sentences short (1–2 each) and focused on one idea.
- Use parallel lists (e.g., “data analysis, robotics maintenance, and design”) and limit to 2–3 items.
- Make the link explicit: short‑term displacement → retraining → growth in new jobs.

Would you like to try one sentence now using a stem? Paste your version and I’ll give quick feedback. If you want, I can also show one polished example after you try.

Thus, There will be more and more era that need us to explore, so the job opportunities will only increase but not decrease, also, more people will be employed to further conduct research and also to solve questions we have.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T18:31:37.364Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — you’re making steady progress. Your last paragraph shows clearer organization and more specific vocabulary (good: “pursue research, innovation, or advanced study”; good signal words like “For example” and “Thus”). I’ll give quick, focused feedback and a couple of short stems you can use to try another revision.

First, here’s your full essay with your latest paragraph included exactly as you wrote it (I preserved the earlier thesis and the topic-sentence edits we already agreed on):

Targeted feedback on your new paragraph (short and actionable)
- Strengths: clearer topic and cause–effect logic; better academic vocabulary (“pursue research, innovation, advanced study”).
- Main issues to fix now:
  1) Repetition and wordiness: “more and more” appears several times; “also” repeats; simplify to be stronger.
  2) Awkward phrasing/grammar: “we can find and we will try to solve them” is clumsy; “There will be more and more era that need us to explore” is unclear and uses the wrong word (“era”).
  3) Run-on ideas: the sentences are long and try to do too much — split into 1–2 short sentences that each express one clear idea.
  4) Repetition of “also”: “also, more people will be employed to further conduct research and also to solve questions” — reduce repetition and tighten wording.

Quick, specific edits you can make (pick a couple)
- Replace “we can find and we will try to solve them” with “they will generate new problems that people will work to solve” or “these advances will create new research questions to be addressed.”
- Replace “There will be more and more era that need us to explore” with “This will create new areas of inquiry” or “This will open new fields for study and innovation.”
- Change “the job opportunities will only increase but not decrease” to “job opportunities will increase” (shorter, stronger).
- Combine the final ideas into one clear sentence: “Consequently, employers will create more jobs in research, development, and design to address these challenges.”

Two short stems you can adapt (choose one and finish)
1) “As more people pursue research and innovation, they will generate new research questions that require human investigation. Consequently, employers will create more job opportunities in ____, ____, and ____.”
2) “This shift will open new fields of study and work, increasing demand for jobs in ____ and ____, because these roles require human creativity and judgment that machines cannot provide.”

Micro grammar reminders
- Avoid repeating “more and more”; one instance is enough.
- Use parallel lists (e.g., “research, development, and design”).
- Keep sentences short and active.
- Watch capitalization mid-sentence (“Thus, There” → “Thus, there”).

Would you like to try revising that paragraph now?
- Option A (recommended): Paste your next version here and I’ll give quick, focused feedback.
- Option B: Ask me to show one short polished example sentence (I’ll provide one only if you request it).

**You:** B

*Time:* 2025-11-26T18:34:42.580Z

**Assistant:** Good choice — here is one polished example sentence you can use to replace the longer, unclear lines in that paragraph. I kept it short, academic, and clearly connected to your topic sentence.

Polished example sentence:
- As more people pursue research, innovation, or advanced study, they will generate new research questions and practical problems that will create demand for jobs in research, development, and design.

I’ve placed that sentence into your full essay exactly (only changes: the thesis, the paragraph 3 topic sentence/supporting sentence we worked on earlier, and this new example sentence). Read it and tell me if you want to keep this sentence or try another version.

Quick summary of what we improved (aligned with your targets)
- Clarity of argument: thesis now clearly states your position and previews reasons (short‑term displacement → long‑term retraining/new jobs).
- Paragraph focus and unity: paragraph 3 now has a clear topic sentence and supporting sentences that link short‑term displacement to retraining and the creation of new jobs.
- Grammar improvements: the sentences we revised in paragraph 3 use more accurate forms and vocabulary (e.g., "cannot," "routine, repetitive tasks," "retrain").

Your next choices
- Are you happy with these changes as they are? (If yes, we can finish this session.)
- Would you like to continue and revise another paragraph (paragraph 2 or the conclusion) next? Note: that would be another focused step in the same three-step process.
- Or would you like one small tweak to the thesis or topic sentence now? (I can suggest a short alternative or minor wording change — you can accept or adjust.)

Tell me which of these you prefer. If you want to continue, pick the next paragraph to work on and we’ll repeat Step 2 and Step 3 for that paragraph.
