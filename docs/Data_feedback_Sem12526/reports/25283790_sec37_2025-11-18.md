        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
From a broader perspective, I think this technological shift will enhance the global employment prospects ultimately. Not only because of the convenience brought by Automation, but also relevant to the positive trend of global technological iteration. Nowadays, automation has already applied in countless industries. We can see automated arms help the factory workers lifting and deliver large goods; the big-data engines automatically selecting and analyzing information, which decrease complex work steps for the internet company employee... What it brings is not a large range of jobs' disappearance, but an effective release of humanity labor. Under the automation background, one simple worker could show energy and ability of a matured organization, while creating endless value. The order of matured technology workers who can use the automated tools is increasing, creating and paving more empty career options and possibility for the new generation. Automation brings huge convenience and bright future for the global employment.
In additional, the automated tools’ developers hold the belief of instrumental justice all the way. Not only the goals of 'serving for humans' have been highlighted, but also they protecting the principle of caring for the global employment. This technology is created under a kind hope to boosting industry efficiency for those developing market economies which does not have that much matured industrial technicist, and the results, actually help these economies’ development.
Moreover, with the increase of the awareness of the possible bad effect of the automation, this kind of technology will improve and developed into a more suitable form for the world. Let's have a positive wish and take actions together!

Revised:
  From a broader perspective, this technological shift will ultimately enhance global employment prospects, owing to both the efficiency of automation and the ongoing advancement of global technologies.
  Today, automation is transforming industries by boosting efficiency and fundamentally reshaping the workplace. From automated robotic arms in factories that help workers lift and transport heavy materials to big-data engines that filter and analyze information, automation streamlines complex tasks across industries. Rather than triggering mass unemployment, automation allows workers to focus on more creative and valuable tasks. It enables individual workers to work more efficiently, creating unprecedented value. It is also opening up new career paths for the next generation, building a brighter and more efficient future for global employment.
  Moreover, automation itself embodies a form of instrumental justice; its development is guided by a commitment to serving human needs and supporting global employment. Automation developers emphasize both human-centered design and the protection of global employment. In areas with limited industrial infrastructure, this technology accelerates productivity growth and creates novel career paths, thus acting as a catalyst for economic development.
  In conclusion, the advantages of automation far outweigh the disadvantages, and its continued development holds immense promise for the future.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-18T01:26:20.078Z

**You:** Let's start by modifying the topic paragraph。From a broader perspective, I think this technological shift will enhance the global employment prospects ultimately. Not only because of the convenience brought by Automation, but also relevant to the positive trend of global technological iteration.

*Time:* 2025-11-18T01:29:31.868Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Before we move straight into revising the topic paragraph, let's follow the structured workflow to make sure your revisions truly support your learning goals.

**Preliminary Stage: Negotiating Targets and Diagnosing the Essay**

### 1. **Negotiating Targets**
First, I’d like to ask:

- What do you personally want to improve most in your essay writing today? For example, are you most concerned with clarity, the strength of your argument, structure and organization, grammar, or vocabulary/style?
- Do you have a specific learning target you’d like to focus on in this session?

---

### 2. **Diagnostic Feedback — Reviewing Your Essay**

Based on your current draft, here’s a brief diagnostic against the rubric:

#### **Strengths:**
- **Content & Ideas:** You express a positive viewpoint about technological automation and its impact on employment, showing global awareness.
- **Organization:** There’s some clear structure: a topic paragraph, supporting examples, discussion of developers’ intentions, and a conclusion.
- **Vocabulary:** You use some topic-specific terms (automation, industry, global employment).
- **Effort in analysis:** You try to offer reasons and explain impacts.

#### **Areas for Improvement:**
- **Thesis & Argument:** The main argument is implied, but the thesis is somewhat vague and not directly answering the essay question. The viewpoint could be stronger and more concise.
- **Organization & Topic Sentences:** The topic sentence could be more connected to the thesis and make the main point upfront. Some sentences are a bit unclear or too generalized.
- **Evidence & Development:** Some claims would benefit from more specific examples or explanation.
- **Vocabulary & Grammar:** There are some awkward phrases (“release of humanity labor,” “empty career options”), word choice errors, and sentence structure problems (“has already applied”; “in additional”).
- **Clarity:** Some sentences are hard to follow and lack connection.

---

### 3. **Student Priority Selection**
Based on this feedback, which issues do you want to work on first for the topic paragraph?

- Thesis clarity and connection
- Topic sentence strength and logic
- Vocabulary and sentence structure (making it sound more academic)
- Organization (logical flow of ideas)

**Which one(s) should we focus on for your topic paragraph? Please choose your priorities.**

---

**Once you've chosen**, we'll begin Step 1 (thesis revision as relevant), then move on to revising your topic paragraph and supporting sentences. 

**Would you like to try clarifying/revising your topic paragraph now, or do you want some guidance on thesis/organization first?**

Let me know what you prefer!

*Time:* 2025-11-18T01:29:37.806Z

**You:** argument, structure and organization,

*Time:* 2025-11-18T01:30:31.285Z

**Assistant:** Great, thanks for letting me know your main priorities: **argument** and **structure/organization**. We’ll focus on making your argument stronger and making sure the structure and topic sentences clearly support that argument.

Let’s proceed with our **structured revision workflow**!

---

## **Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision**

First, let’s look at your current thesis. The thesis should:
- Clearly answer the question
- Preview your main reasons or points
- Use confident, academic language

**Your Current Thesis:**
> From a broader perspective, I think this technological shift will enhance the global employment prospects ultimately. Not only because of the convenience brought by Automation, but also relevant to the positive trend of global technological iteration.

### **Feedback:**
- *“I think”* is too tentative for academic writing.
- The thesis isn’t clear about exactly **how** automation improves global employment—what are your main supporting reasons?
- The second sentence is a fragment.

#### **Guiding Questions:**
- What are the top 2–3 reasons you believe automation is good for global employment? (For example: makes jobs easier, creates new kinds of jobs, helps developing economies, etc.)

**Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement based on this feedback and your main reasons?**  
You can write your attempt here, and I’ll give you feedback!

---

## **(After you revise, we’ll confirm your thesis, then continue to your topic paragraph and structure as your next priorities.)**

Let’s focus on one step at a time, together!  
**What would your improved thesis statement be?**

*Time:* 2025-11-18T01:30:36.380Z

**You:** From a broader perspective, this technological shift will ultimately enhance global employment prospects, owing to both the efficiency of automation and the ongoing advancement of global technologies.

*Time:* 2025-11-18T01:35:42.309Z

**Assistant:** Excellent work! Your revised thesis is a strong improvement. It’s more confident and academic, and you’ve previewed two supporting reasons: efficiency of automation and advancement of technologies.

Let’s review it for clarity and strength:

**Your Revised Thesis:**  
> From a broader perspective, this technological shift will ultimately enhance global employment prospects, owing to both the efficiency of automation and the ongoing advancement of global technologies.

**Feedback:**
- Good! It’s direct and states your position clearly.
- You reference “efficiency” and “advancement of technologies”; these can guide your body paragraphs.
- For further strength, you could specify *how* these factors help employment (e.g., creating new job opportunities, supporting development).

**Optional** (for an even sharper thesis):  
> From a broader perspective, this technological shift will ultimately enhance global employment prospects by increasing workplace efficiency, creating new job opportunities, and supporting economic growth through advancing technology.

**Would you like to keep your version, or try specifying *how* these factors improve employment?**  
Your original is already much improved, so it’s up to you!

**Please confirm your preferred thesis**, then we’ll move to Step 2: topic sentence revision.

---

### **Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision**

Now, let’s revise the topic sentence of your first body paragraph so it clearly connects to your new thesis.

**Your current topic sentence:**  
> Nowadays, automation has already applied in countless industries.

**Feedback:**
- The sentence is a bit awkward in form (“has already applied”) and could be clearer.
- It should connect directly to your thesis and preview the point you’ll make in this paragraph.

**Guiding Questions:**
- What is *the main idea* you want this paragraph to prove? Is it about efficiency, widespread use, or job creation?
- How does this connect to “efficiency of automation” in your thesis?

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence here?**  
Aim for a sentence like:  
> “Automation is increasingly used across industries, improving efficiency and reshaping the workplace.”

---

Please write your revised topic sentence, and I’ll guide you further!

*Time:* 2025-11-18T01:35:49.498Z

**You:** Today, automation is transforming industries by boosting efficiency and fundamentally reshaping the workplace.

*Time:* 2025-11-18T01:38:23.437Z

**Assistant:** Great work! Your revised topic sentence is strong: it clearly connects to your thesis and previews the paragraph’s main ideas—**efficiency** and **workplace changes**.  
Let’s check it for clarity and academic tone:

**Your revised topic sentence:**  
> Today, automation is transforming industries by boosting efficiency and fundamentally reshaping the workplace.

**Feedback:**
- Clear and academic.
- Connects directly to your supporting thesis points.
- Tells the reader what the paragraph will discuss.

**Would you like to keep this version, or try another phrasing? If you’re satisfied, we’ll move to Step 3: revising your supporting sentences.**

---

## **Step 3 — Revising Supporting Sentences (Body Paragraph)**

Let’s look at your supporting sentences to ensure they:
- Clearly relate to the new topic sentence.
- Are logically ordered and have good flow.
- Use strong, academic language and correct grammar.

Here’s the full paragraph with your new topic sentence at the start:

> Today, automation is transforming industries by boosting efficiency and fundamentally reshaping the workplace.
>
> We can see automated arms help the factory workers lifting and deliver large goods; the big-data engines automatically selecting and analyzing information, which decrease complex work steps for the internet company employee... What it brings is not a large range of jobs' disappearance, but an effective release of humanity labor. Under the automation background, one simple worker could show energy and ability of a matured organization, while creating endless value. The order of matured technology workers who can use the automated tools is increasing, creating and paving more empty career options and possibility for the new generation. Automation brings huge convenience and bright future for the global employment.

### **Guiding Questions & Suggestions:**
Let's look for areas to clarify and strengthen (focused on your priorities: argument & structure):

1. **Are your examples (factory arms, big-data engines) explained clearly?**  
Would it help to add more detail about **how** these technologies improve efficiency?

2. **Does each sentence relate back to efficiency or workplace transformation?**  
Avoid general phrases and emphasize how automation helps.

3. **Are there any confusing phrases or grammar errors?**  
(For example: “release of humanity labor,” “order of matured technology workers,” “empty career options”)

---

### **Step-by-step revision (You revise, I guide):**
Let’s start with the first supporting detail.  
**Current:**  
> We can see automated arms help the factory workers lifting and deliver large goods...

**Would you like to revise this for clarity and smooth, academic language?**  
For example, you could say:  
> “For instance, automated robotic arms in factories assist workers by lifting and transporting heavy materials.”

**Please try revising this sentence in your own words. When done, we’ll move to the next supporting detail.**

---

Let’s keep going step by step.  
Once you reply, I will offer feedback and tips for each sentence—together we’ll build a unified, strong paragraph!

---

### **Current full revised draft after topic sentence:**
---

Today, automation is transforming industries by boosting efficiency and fundamentally reshaping the workplace.  
We can see automated arms help the factory workers lifting and deliver large goods; the big-data engines automatically selecting and analyzing information, which decrease complex work steps for the internet company employee... What it brings is not a large range of jobs' disappearance, but an effective release of humanity labor. Under the automation background, one simple worker could show energy and ability of a matured organization, while creating endless value. The order of matured technology workers who can use the automated tools is increasing, creating and paving more empty career options and possibility for the new generation. Automation brings huge convenience and bright future for the global employment.

---

**Let’s revise each supporting detail one by one—please start with your rewrite of the first example ("automated arms help factory workers"), and we’ll continue from there!**

*Time:* 2025-11-18T01:38:31.492Z

**You:** From automated robotic arms in factories help workers with lifting and transporting heavy materials, to big-data engines that filter and analyze information, this technology is streamlining complex tasks across industries.

*Time:* 2025-11-18T01:44:00.690Z

**Assistant:** Great work! Your revision is more clear and academic:

> From automated robotic arms in factories help workers with lifting and transporting heavy materials, to big-data engines that filter and analyze information, this technology is streamlining complex tasks across industries.

Let’s review and slightly refine for grammar and flow (without rewriting for you!):

- The opening "From...to..." structure should use parallel phrasing and connect smoothly.
- You might say: "From automated robotic arms in factories that help workers lift and transport heavy materials to big-data engines that filter and analyze information, automation streamlines complex tasks across industries."

**Would you like to try adjusting your sentence for parallel structure and to directly link to “automation”?**

---

**Next Step:**  
Once you’re happy with that sentence, let’s look at your next supporting point.

**Current:**  
> What it brings is not a large range of jobs' disappearance, but an effective release of humanity labor.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is “release of humanity labor” clear? Can you rephrase to show that automation helps humans focus on more valuable work?
- How does automation benefit workers rather than replace them?

**You might try:**  
"Instead of causing widespread job loss, automation allows workers to focus on more creative and valuable tasks."

**Would you like to write your version of this idea? Give it a try, and I’ll offer feedback!**

*Time:* 2025-11-18T01:44:05.525Z

**You:** Rather than triggering mass unemployment, automation allows workers to focus on more creative and valuable tasks.

*Time:* 2025-11-18T01:54:45.979Z

**Assistant:** Excellent revision! That’s much clearer, concise, and academic. You now have two smooth, well-connected supporting sentences that relate directly to your topic sentence and thesis.

Let’s review your progress and then continue step by step with the next supporting idea.

---

### **Revised Paragraph So Far:**

Today, automation is transforming industries by boosting efficiency and fundamentally reshaping the workplace.  
From automated robotic arms in factories that help workers lift and transport heavy materials to big-data engines that filter and analyze information, automation streamlines complex tasks across industries.  
Rather than triggering mass unemployment, automation allows workers to focus on more creative and valuable tasks.

---

**Next Supporting Sentence (from your original):**

> Under the automation background, one simple worker could show energy and ability of a matured organization, while creating endless value.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is this idea about how automation increases individual worker productivity?
- Can you rephrase to explain that automation empowers workers to achieve more?

**Model for Reference (don’t copy, just for ideas):**
"Automation enables individual employees to contribute more effectively, increasing productivity and overall value within organizations."

**Would you like to try rewriting that sentence in your own words, keeping it clear and aligned to your argument about workplace transformation and efficiency?**

---

When you've revised this sentence, we'll look at the final supporting idea before wrapping up this paragraph!

Let’s keep going step by step. You're making excellent progress!

*Time:* 2025-11-18T01:54:51.374Z

**You:** It enables individual workers to contribute productive power efficiently, creating unprecedented value.

*Time:* 2025-11-18T02:01:09.508Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic revision! Your newest sentence is much clearer and connects strongly to your thesis and argument. You now highlight **how automation empowers individual workers to be more productive and create more value**.

Let’s review and further polish for academic tone and flow:

**Your revised sentence:**
> It enables individual workers to contribute productive power efficiently, creating unprecedented value.

**Tips:**
- “Contribute productive power” is a bit awkward; you might say “work more efficiently.”
- “Creating unprecedented value” is excellent and academic.

**You:** Automation are opening up new career paths for the next generation, building a brighter and more efficient future for global employment.

*Time:* 2025-11-18T02:08:07.481Z

**Assistant:** Great job! Your new sentence is much clearer and academic, and it connects well to your argument about opportunities for future generations.

Let’s review and suggest a slight adjustment for grammar and smoother flow:

**Your sentence:**  
> Automation are opening up new career paths for the next generation, building a brighter and more efficient future for global employment.

**Suggestions:**
- "Automation are" should be "Automation is"
- You might add "by" to clarify the action: "by opening up..."
- "Building" connects nicely to your earlier points about efficiency and opportunity.

**Optional, even more academic phrasing (for your inspiration):**  
> Automation is opening up new career paths for the next generation, paving the way for a brighter and more efficient future in global employment.

**Would you like to adopt the revised phrasing, or keep yours with that slight grammar correction ("is" not "are")? Either version works well!**

From a broader perspective, this technological shift will ultimately enhance global employment prospects, owing to both the efficiency of automation and the ongoing advancement of global technologies.

Today, automation is transforming industries by boosting efficiency and fundamentally reshaping the workplace. From automated robotic arms in factories that help workers lift and transport heavy materials to big-data engines that filter and analyze information, automation streamlines complex tasks across industries. Rather than triggering mass unemployment, automation allows workers to focus on more creative and valuable tasks. It enables individual workers to work more efficiently, creating unprecedented value. Automation is opening up new career paths for the next generation, building a brighter and more efficient future for global employment.

In addition, the developers of automated tools hold the belief of instrumental justice. Not only have the goals of 'serving humans' been highlighted, but the principle of caring for global employment has also been protected. This technology is created with the hope of boosting industry efficiency for developing market economies that do not yet have many mature industrial technicians, and the results actually help these economies develop.

Moreover, as awareness of the possible negative effects of automation increases, this technology will continue to improve and develop into a more suitable form for the world. Let's have a positive outlook and take action together!

**Your essay is progressing very well! Let me know if you want to review or revise any other section.**

*Time:* 2025-11-18T02:08:15.012Z

**You:** I want to revise the second topic paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-18T02:15:54.082Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let’s use our **structured workflow** to revise your second topic paragraph, focusing on your chosen priorities: **argument strength** and **structure/organization**.

---

## **Step 1 — Diagnose the Second Topic Paragraph**

Here’s your original second topic paragraph:

> In addition, the developers of automated tools hold the belief of instrumental justice. Not only have the goals of 'serving humans' been highlighted, but the principle of caring for global employment has also been protected. This technology is created with the hope of boosting industry efficiency for developing market economies that do not yet have many mature industrial technicians, and the results actually help these economies develop.

### **Quick Diagnosis**

**Strengths:**
- Ambitious attempt to discuss the intentions of automation developers.
- Mentions fairness (“instrumental justice”) and help for developing economies.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **Topic sentence:** The main idea needs to be clearer and connect directly to the thesis.
- **Clarity:** Some phrasing (“instrumental justice,” “served humans”) is vague or awkward.
- **Supporting detail:** Needs more specific explanation or examples of how automation helps developing markets.
- **Logical Flow:** Sentences could link together more smoothly.

---

## **Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision**

Let’s make sure your topic sentence:
- Clearly states the paragraph’s main idea.
- Connects directly to your thesis and previews what you’ll argue.

**Guiding questions:**
- What main point does this paragraph support? (E.g., “Developers aim for automation to improve fairness and support employment globally—especially in developing economies.”)
- How does this relate to your thesis about automation’s positive impact on global employment?

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence first?**  
Aim for clear, direct language.  
For example:  
> "The development of automation is guided by a commitment to serving human needs and supporting global employment, especially in developing economies."

**Write your revised topic sentence and I’ll provide feedback before you continue to the supporting sentences!**

---

When you’re ready, reply with your revised topic sentence!  
We’ll work together, step by step.

*Time:* 2025-11-18T02:16:00.223Z

**You:** Moreover, automation itself embodies a form of instrumental justice, its development is guided by a commitment to serving human needs and supporting global employment.

*Time:* 2025-11-18T02:20:04.552Z

**Assistant:** Excellent revision! Your topic sentence is now much clearer, more academic, and it directly connects to your thesis. It also introduces the key concept ("instrumental justice") and the idea of supporting global employment. Nice work!

Let's just fine-tune the grammatical flow for even greater clarity and coherence:

Your version:  
> Moreover, automation itself embodies a form of instrumental justice, its development is guided by a commitment to serving human needs and supporting global employment.

This is actually a **comma splice** (two independent clauses joined by a comma). For academic writing, we can join with "and," use a semicolon, or split into two sentences. Here’s how you might adjust it:

**Option 1 (Single sentence with 'and'):**
> Moreover, automation itself embodies a form of instrumental justice, and its development is guided by a commitment to serving human needs and supporting global employment.

**Option 2 (Two sentences):**
> Moreover, automation itself embodies a form of instrumental justice. Its development is guided by a commitment to serving human needs and supporting global employment.

**Option 3 (Semicolon):**
> Moreover, automation itself embodies a form of instrumental justice; its development is guided by a commitment to serving human needs and supporting global employment.

**Would you like to choose one of these options, or revise with your own version?**
Let me know your preferred phrasing!  
Once you confirm, we'll move on to **revising the supporting sentences.**

## Step 3 – Revising Supporting Sentences

Here’s your current supporting sentences:
> Not only have the goals of 'serving humans' been highlighted, but the principle of caring for global employment has also been protected. This technology is created with the hope of boosting industry efficiency for developing market economies that do not yet have many mature industrial technicians, and the results actually help these economies develop.

### **Guiding Questions:**
- Can you clarify and specify how “serving humans” and “protecting employment” are key goals?
- Can you explain with a specific example how automation boosts efficiency and helps developing markets?
- Are there awkward or unclear phrases you’d like to improve ("protected," "mature industrial technicians")?

**Let’s start with the first supporting detail:**
- *Current*: "Not only have the goals of 'serving humans' been highlighted, but the principle of caring for global employment has also been protected."
- **How can you rephrase to clarify the meaning and be more direct?**
- For example: “Automation developers emphasize both human-centered design and the protection of global employment.”
