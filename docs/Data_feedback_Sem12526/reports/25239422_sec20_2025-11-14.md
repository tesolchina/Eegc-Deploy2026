            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sticking with the process! To help you move forward, here’s a clear example of a revised thesis statement based on your original idea and the suggestions we discussed:

---

**Revised Thesis Example:**  
Although governments and large companies have the greatest power to combat climate change, individuals play an important role both by influencing government policies and by adopting sustainable lifestyle choices.

---

This version:  
- States your position clearly and confidently  
- Highlights both main points you will discuss (government influence and personal choices)  
- Is concise and direct, setting up the essay’s structure  

If you’d like, you can try creating your own version now by using this as a model. When you share it, I can help you polish it further before we move on to revising a topic sentence. Would you like to try?

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Great work on your essay draft! Let's begin our structured revision process, step by step, keeping your academic goals in mind.

**Step 1 — Revise the Thesis Statement**

First, please share your current thesis statement.  
Is it:  
> "Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Let's look at it together.  
Here are some initial thoughts:
- **Clarity**: It addresses the essay topic, but the wording could be more direct.
- **Strength and Focus**: “I partly agree…” is fine, but we can make it even more confident.
- **Essay Structure**: Try to mention clearly what your main arguments will be (government influence and personal choices).

**Suggestions to improve:**
- Answer the essay prompt directly in one sentence.
- Preview BOTH main points (citizens influencing government + personal green choices).
- Use clear, confident language (avoid “I think,” “I believe,” “maybe”).

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis statement now, following these hints?  
Once you write your revised thesis, we’ll review it and make sure you’re happy before moving to step 2.

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your current thesis statement! Here it is again:

I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Let’s review:

**Strengths:**
- You address the main topic and your position ("partly agree").
- You mention two areas: influencing government and personal choices.

**Possible improvements:**
- Make the thesis more concise so that your stance is clear from the start.
- Try to state the two main points more directly.
- Avoid “I believe” and “I think”—use confident statements.

**Prompts to guide your revision:**
- How can you clearly express that both citizens’ influence on government and personal green choices matter, but to different extents?
- Can you preview your essay structure in one punchy sentence?
- Try to use precise language—for example, "Although government and business actions have the greatest impact, individuals play a significant role both by shaping policy and making sustainable lifestyle choices."

**Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now, using these suggestions?**  
Once you do, please share your new version, and I’ll help you refine it if needed!
