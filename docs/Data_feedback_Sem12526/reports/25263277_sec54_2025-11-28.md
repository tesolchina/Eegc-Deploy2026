            ## Contribution Analysis

            ### Summary of Training Assessment Report

**Essay Writing:**  
- The student submitted an original essay on climate change with a partial agreement thesis and two main support points.  
- The "revised" essay is identical to the original; no substantive improvements in content, organization, vocabulary, or grammar were made.  
- The thesis did not get the required confident, concise revision with clearly previewed points despite repeated assistant prompts.  
- Body paragraphs remained unedited and lacked stronger examples or polishing.

**Human-AI Interaction:**  
- The conversation spanned 14 messages with the assistant providing detailed, stepwise guidance focusing first on revising the thesis before moving to paragraph edits.  
- The student consistently avoided the mandatory thesis revision step by refusing with "move on," providing only thesis fragments, or repeating original text.  
- The student attempted to skip ahead to paragraph revision without completing thesis revision. When pressed, the student pasted an unrelated, unedited paragraph about automation and jobs, which also lacked a clear thesis for that new topic.  
- The student showed minimal critical engagement with AI suggestions, making no explicit acceptance or reasoned rejection of guidance and little independent editing or refinement.  
- Overall, interaction quality scores indicate a need for stronger stepwise adherence, critical review, and iterative refinement.

**Strengths:**  
- Clear initial essay position with logical structure.  
- Willingness to engage repeatedly with AI, showing some persistence.

**Areas for Development:**  
- Mandatory process compliance: always revise thesis fully before moving on.  
- Focus and relevance: avoid introducing unrelated content mid-task without notice.  
- Grammar and clarity improvements through short, manageable revision cycles.  
- Critical engagement: accept, reject with reasons, or revise AI suggestions clearly.  
- Strategic planning: follow the assistant’s stepwise workflow for best results.

**Recommendations:**  
1. Submit a confident, single-sentence revised thesis that previews the two main points in parallel before any paragraph editing.  
2. Use stepwise small revisions (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph → final proofread) submitting drafts and giving explicit feedback at each stage.  
3. Improve grammar and clarity using automated checks or peer review.  
4. When switching essay topics, clearly state the change and produce a matching thesis accordingly.  
5. Engage critically with AI guidance by explaining choices or proposing alternatives.

**Instructor Notes:**  
- The session lacks completed mandatory tasks (revised thesis, topic sentence revision, paragraph revision). The student resisted required steps and introduced off-topic unedited text, indicating possible confusion or difficulty focusing.  
- Suggested instructor action: require clear submission of a revised thesis and one fully revised body paragraph with tracked changes or before/after texts. Consider a one-on-one session to ensure understanding of the iterative revision process.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The essay takes a clear, relevant position ("I partly agree") and identifies two reasonable reasons (citizen pressure on government; personal lifestyle choices influence markets/norms). Development is basic and repetitive; claims lack concrete evidence or varied examples.
- Organization: 21/25 - Logical paragraphing (introduction, two body paragraphs, conclusion). Topic progression is predictable, but transitions and paragraph cohesion are weak in places (repetition of ideas across paragraphs).
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary is generally adequate and appropriate for the topic but simple and repetitive; some imprecise word choices ("normal people," "maybe just listen a little").
- Grammar: 16/25 - Frequent grammar, punctuation, and phrasing errors that sometimes impede fluency (sentence fragments, tense/number issues, informal constructions).
- **Original Essay Total: 75/100**

Evidence (original): thesis fragment — "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play." Example support — "if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy."

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - No substantive changes from the original draft. Same ideas and level of development.
- Organization: 21/25 - Structure unchanged; paragraphs remain the same.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - No evident vocabulary improvement.
- Grammar: 16/25 - Grammar and phrasing errors remain; the revised essay is identical to the original.
- **Revised Essay Total: 75/100**

Evidence (revised): The "revised" essay text is identical to the original; the thesis and body paragraphs are unchanged.

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None detected in the provided "revised" essay — the text is unchanged.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Revise the thesis into a single confident sentence that previews the two main points in parallel (assistant repeatedly requested this but student did not produce it).
  - Strengthen body paragraphs with concrete evidence, specific examples, or brief data/support for claims.
  - Correct grammar, punctuation, and phrasing errors; improve sentence variety and transitions.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 14** (14 messages in the provided chat log).
- **Conversation Quality:** Multiple assistant prompts guide a required stepwise process (thesis first), but the student repeatedly resisted completing the mandatory thesis revision and attempted to move forward without it. At one point the student pasted unrelated, highly unedited text about automation and jobs, indicating topic confusion or a shift in focus.

Key chat excerpts:
- Assistant insistence on thesis: "I can’t continue until you post a revised thesis you’re happy with."
- Student resisting: "move on" and later "ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph" without posting the required one-sentence thesis.
- Student provided only a thesis fragment: "I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."
- Student pasted unrelated, poorly edited paragraph about automation: "With the development of Dautomation, industries ss are generally changing steps by steps..." (this appears off-topic and unedited).

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - The exchange count is moderate (14 messages), and the assistant provided detailed, stepwise guidance. However, the student's responses were often brief, did not follow the required steps, and the conversation lacked deep, multi-level questions or iterative content revisions that demonstrate in-depth engagement.
  - Evidence: Multiple assistant messages asking for a one-sentence revised thesis; the student repeatedly failed to provide it and attempted to advance the task.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - The student did not demonstrably evaluate or justify acceptance/rejection of the assistant's suggestions. The student occasionally produced fragments and then ignored guidance (e.g., insisted on moving on).
  - Evidence: Assistant provided templates and explicit requirements; student replied "move on" and posted partial fragments rather than addressing the templates or giving reasons for rejecting suggestions.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - Minimal measurable refinement occurred. The required iterative cycle (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph revision) was not completed; the student attempted to skip steps and later supplied unrelated raw text.
  - Evidence: Assistant repeatedly required the thesis before paragraph revision; no complete revised thesis or revised paragraph for the original essay was produced.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student has a clear position and an appropriate argumentative structure to work from (intro, two main points, conclusion) — evidence: thesis fragment and paragraph topics.
- The student provided a full draft essay (original), showing readiness to work on revision.
- The student engaged with the AI multiple times rather than abandoning the session, indicating willingness to continue.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Follow the assistant's required stepwise process: the thesis revision was mandatory and was not completed. Recommendation: produce a single confident thesis sentence using the assistant's template before moving on.
- Topic focus and coherence: avoid pasting unrelated drafts (automation paragraph) during a climate essay revision. If switching topics, clearly state that and reset the task.
- Edit for grammar and clarity: fix sentence fragments, subject-verb agreement, and informal phrasing. Use short revision cycles (thesis → one topic sentence → paragraph edit → proofread).
- Critical engagement with AI: when the assistant provides options or templates, respond with acceptance, rejection with reasons, or a new draft to show critical evaluation.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student did not supply a revised thesis as requested and introduced unrelated text without clarifying intent. Evidence: repeated assistant prompts and the student's noncompliant replies ("move on"), plus the unrelated automation paragraph.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The required plan (thesis first, then paragraph edits) was not followed.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student did not explicitly evaluate AI suggestions or provide rationale for choices.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - Little independent revision occurred; the "revised" essay is identical to the original and the student pasted an unedited unrelated paragraph.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Complete mandatory revision steps in order. Start by posting a single, confident thesis sentence that clearly previews two parallel reasons (use the assistant's template); do not skip this step.
2. Use focused, small revision cycles: revise the thesis → revise one topic sentence → revise one paragraph → proofread. After each step, submit the new text and accept or explicitly critique the assistant's suggestions.
3. Prioritize grammar and clarity: run a basic grammar pass (sentence boundaries, subject-verb agreement, punctuation). For content, add at least one specific example or brief statistic to support each main claim.
4. If switching topics (e.g., from climate to automation), clearly state the new assignment and provide a matching thesis so the AI can help consistently.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student did not complete the three mandatory tasks: (1) revised thesis statement, (2) revised topic sentence, (3) revised body paragraph — the "revised" essay is identical to the original; the chat shows repeated assistant prompts requesting a one-sentence thesis that was not supplied. Please note the student also pasted an unrelated and poorly edited paragraph about automation jobs; this may indicate confusion about the assignment or difficulty focusing on the requested revision steps.
- Recommended instructor action: require the student to submit a one-sentence thesis (per the provided template) and one revised paragraph (with tracked changes or clear before/after text) before grading. Consider a short one-on-one check to ensure the student understands the required workflow and can follow the iterative revision process.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-28T06:24:00.374Z

**You:** I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T06:28:22.911Z

**Assistant:** Step 1 — Thesis statement

Thanks — I can see your current thesis in the first paragraph:
"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

What’s strong:
- It gives a position (partly agree).
- It mentions the two main ideas you discuss: citizens influencing government, and personal lifestyle choices.

What could be improved:
- Clarity and focus: it is long and a little repetitive (e.g., “I believe” and “I also think” weaken the tone).
- Preview and structure: it should more clearly preview the two reasons and signal how they relate (cause/effect or limits).
- Confident language: avoid hedges like “I believe,” “maybe,” or “while less impactful.” Use direct, assertive phrasing.

Quick guidance to revise (do not copy a full sentence from me — use this as a frame):
- Start with your clear stance: “I partly agree that…”
- Then list the two reasons in parallel (short phrases): 1) how individuals influence government/policy, 2) how personal choices affect social norms/market demand but have limits without policy.
- Close with a short statement about the needed cooperation or the extent of impact (shows nuance).

A simple thesis frame you can use to build your own sentence:
- “I partly agree that [brief answer to question]; while individual actions are limited compared with governments and corporations, they matter because [reason 1] and [reason 2].”

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using that frame? After you post your revised thesis, I’ll give focused feedback and we’ll move to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T06:28:39.720Z

**You:** move on

*Time:* 2025-11-28T06:31:22.980Z

**Assistant:** I can move on — but first a quick reminder: revising the thesis is mandatory before we work on a paragraph. I can’t continue until you post a revised thesis you’re happy with.

To make this fast, use this short fill-in-the-blank template and post your one-sentence revision:

"I partly agree that [brief answer to the question]; while individual actions are limited compared with governments and corporations, they matter because [reason 1 — influence on policy/public pressure] and [reason 2 — influence on social norms/market demand]."

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using that frame? Once you post it, I’ll give focused feedback and then we’ll pick a paragraph to revise.

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for sharing your thesis. I can see the main idea and the two reasons you want to cover. Before we move on, let’s make the thesis clearer, more confident, and more concise.

What’s good now
- You state a position (partly agree).
- You name two reasons you'll discuss (influence on government; personal lifestyle effects).

What to improve
- Remove hedging language like “I believe” and “I also think” — state your view directly.
- Make the two reasons parallel and specific so the reader knows the essay structure.
- Show the relationship between individual actions and larger institutions (e.g., individuals pressure policy; personal choices affect norms/markets but have limits without policy).

Quick checklist for a strong thesis
- One confident sentence.
- Directly answers the question (extent of agreement).
- Previews the two main points in parallel phrases.
- Signals the nuance (why you partly agree).

Use this short template to rewrite your thesis (fill in the brackets; don’t copy a full example from me):
"I partly agree that [brief answer to the question]; while individual actions are limited compared with governments and corporations, they matter because [reason 1 — influence on policy/public pressure] and [reason 2 — influence on social norms/market demand]."

Would you like to try rewriting your one-sentence thesis now using that frame? Post it here, and I’ll give focused feedback. I can’t move to the paragraph-level revision until you confirm you’re happy with the revised thesis.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T06:32:02.416Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-28T06:34:34.102Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — glad you want to keep going. Quick reminder: we must finish Step 1 (thesis revision) before moving on. Please post your one-sentence revised thesis now.

Use this short template if it helps:
"I partly agree that [brief answer to the question]; while individual actions are limited compared with governments and corporations, they matter because [reason 1 — influence on policy/public pressure] and [reason 2 — influence on social norms/market demand]."

After you post the revised thesis, tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (Paragraph 2 — influence on government, or Paragraph 3 — personal lifestyle). Then paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence. I’ll give focused feedback on the topic sentence and help you revise it so it clearly connects to your new thesis. Would you like to try the thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-28T06:34:42.982Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph#1

*Time:* 2025-11-28T06:35:25.998Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I’m ready to work on paragraph 1 with you. Before we start Step 2, we must finish Step 1: please post your one-sentence revised thesis. (Remember the thesis revision is mandatory.)

Quick reminders to help you rewrite the thesis:
- Use the template I gave: "I partly agree that [brief answer]; while individual actions are limited compared with governments and corporations, they matter because [reason 1 — influence on policy/public pressure] and [reason 2 — influence on social norms/market demand]."
- Make it confident, concise, and preview the two clear reasons.

Once you post the revised thesis and confirm you’re happy with it, tell me you want to work on body paragraph 1 (you already said that) and paste the paragraph’s current topic sentence. If you prefer, confirm that the current topic sentence is: "The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians." I’ll then give focused feedback on that topic sentence and guide you to revise it so it connects strongly to your new thesis. Would you like to paste the revised thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-28T06:35:40.905Z

**You:** I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T06:42:14.123Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I see the phrase you posted: "I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Quick feedback on that fragment
- Strengths: It captures your nuance (individual actions matter, but less than governments/corporations).
- What to improve: It’s hedged ("I also think"), feels like a second clause rather than a full thesis, and doesn’t preview the two clear reasons your essay will develop. A thesis should be one confident sentence that directly answers the question and lists the main points in parallel.

What I need from you now (mandatory before we move on)
- Please rewrite your thesis as one clear, confident sentence that answers the question and previews your two reasons (influence on policy/public pressure; influence on social norms/market demand/consumer choice).
- Use this short template to help you (fill in the brackets):

"I partly agree that [brief answer to the question]; while individual actions are limited compared with governments and corporations, they matter because [reason 1 — influence on policy/public pressure] and [reason 2 — influence on social norms/market demand]."

Would you like to try rewriting the whole thesis now using that template? Post your one-sentence revision here. Once you’re happy with it, tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (Paragraph 2: influencing government, or Paragraph 3: personal lifestyle). I’ll then help you revise that paragraph’s topic sentence.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T06:42:23.994Z

**You:** ok let’s revise the rest of the body paragraph ：With the development of Dautomation, industries ss are generally changing steps by steps.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T06:52:58.962Z

**Assistant:** Quick check before we start: the paragraph you pasted is about automation and jobs (a different topic from your climate essay). That’s fine — but step 1 is mandatory: we must revise the thesis for the same essay as the paragraph. 

Step 1 — Thesis statement
Please paste the current thesis sentence for this automation essay. If you don’t have one yet, please create one using this short fill‑in template (one confident sentence only):

"I [agree / disagree / partly agree] that automation will [brief answer about its overall effect on employment]; while automation may [reason 1 — displace routine jobs], it also [reason 2 — create new opportunities by increasing productivity and demand for higher-skilled work]."

Post your one-sentence thesis here. I’ll give quick, focused feedback on clarity, strength, and focus, and then we’ll move on — but I can’t continue until you share that revised thesis.

Would you like to try the template now?
