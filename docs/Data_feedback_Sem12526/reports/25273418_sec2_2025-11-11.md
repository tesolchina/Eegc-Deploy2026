            ## Contribution Analysis

            Here is a concise summary of your training assessment and next steps, based on your current progress and chat history:

---

### Summary of Current Status

- You have actively engaged with AI guidance by asking for feedback, clarification, and model sentences for:
  - Thesis statement revision
  - Topic sentence revision for both body paragraphs
  - Body paragraph improvement suggestions

- However, you have not yet submitted your own rewritten thesis statement, topic sentences, or body paragraph content for instructor or AI review.

---

### What You Have Worked On

- **Thesis statement:**  
  You asked for improvements and received a clear model thesis emphasizing two key points: (1) individuals influencing government policies and (2) personal green lifestyle choices.

- **Topic sentences:**  
  You requested models and were provided with improved topic sentences for both paragraphs, phrased in clear, academic style connected to your thesis.

- **Body paragraph (Paragraph 2) revision:**  
  You reviewed detailed guidance and example rewrites to improve sentence clarity, academic tone, logical flow, and formal vocabulary, especially for the paragraph’s conclusion.

---

### What Is Still Needed

- **Your own rewritten thesis statement:**  
  Please draft and submit your improved thesis statement using the model and guidelines provided.

- **Your own revised topic sentences:**  
  Write your own versions (in your own words) of the topic sentences for Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2.

- **Your own revised body paragraph content:**  
  Using the detailed advice and model phrases, revise at least Paragraph 2’s body paragraph and share your rewritten sentences or full paragraph.

---

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Produce your own rewritten thesis statement** that confidently states your position and previews your two main supporting points.

2. **Rewrite each topic sentence,** applying the suggested style for clear academic writing that links to your thesis.

3. **Revise Paragraph 2’s body paragraph**, focusing on incorporating the suggested formal language and logical connections, especially in the concluding sentences.

4. **Submit these revisions for feedback.** This active revision is critical for developing your independent writing skills and moving beyond the guidance/model phase.

---

### Additional Tips

- Take each step at a time—start by drafting the thesis statement, then topic sentences, then the paragraph revision.

- Use the models as inspiration, but be sure to put ideas into your own words.

- Focus on formal vocabulary, clear logic, and making sure every sentence supports your main ideas.

- Remember that your ownership of the writing and critical reflection on AI suggestions will improve your skills dramatically.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

One key way individuals contribute to the fight against climate change is by influencing government policies and decisions. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

Individuals also play an important role in addressing climate change by adopting environmentally friendly habits in their everyday lives. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes many individuals prioritize convenience over environmental consciousness, which may hinder widespread adoption of green practices, so this is problem. Or maybe if sustainable habits are adopted by only a small fraction of the population, their overall impact on climate change is limited, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:19:40.635Z

**You:** Help me find out thesis statement of the original draft

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:30:36.569Z

**Assistant:** Great job sharing your draft! Let’s begin with Step 1: **Revising the Thesis Statement**.

First, let's locate your thesis statement.

Your thesis statement is usually found at the end of your introduction and should clearly state your main answer to the essay question, as well as briefly mention your supporting points.

Looking at your original introduction:
> "Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

**Thesis Statement:**  
*I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.*

Would you agree this is your thesis statement? If so, let's talk about:
- Clarity: Is it easy to understand your main point?
- Strength: Is your opinion clear and confident?
- Focus: Does it mention the main ideas you will discuss?

What do you think: Do you feel your thesis statement is clear and strong? Or would you like some feedback on improving it before you try revising?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:30:39.491Z

**You:** Yes,pkease improve my thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:32:40.976Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely, let’s work on improving your thesis statement together!

Here’s some constructive feedback on your original thesis:

**Clarity:**  
Your position is a bit long and slightly complicated. Dividing your opinion into two parts (“partly agree… because… but also think…”) is good, but the sentence could be clearer and more concise.

**Strength:**  
The statement uses phrases like “I partly agree” and “I also think,” which sound a little uncertain. Try to use more assertive language for academic writing.

**Focus:**  
You mention two main ideas:  
1. Individuals can influence government decisions (very important)  
2. Green lifestyle choices, even though less impactful, still matter

This is good—you are previewing your main points!

**Suggestions for Revision:**  
- Use confident language (“While the actions of individuals may seem less significant than those of governments and companies, they remain important because…”)
- Make the two areas of focus clear (government influence and personal actions)
- Answer the essay question directly and clearly

**Now, your turn!**  
Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement with these points in mind? Aim for one sentence that answers the question directly, is clear, and confidently mentions the two key areas you will discuss.

Take your time, and I’m here to help! If you get stuck, just ask for an example. Would you like to give it a try now?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:32:47.298Z

**You:** show me the improved thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:33:18.856Z

**Assistant:** I'm glad you're ready to try revising your thesis! To best support your learning, I want you to attempt rewriting it first, using my feedback above.

Here’s a reminder of the guidelines to help you:

**Focus on:**
- Answering the essay question directly.
- Using confident, precise language.
- Clearly listing your two main supporting points: (1) citizens influencing government, and (2) personal green lifestyle choices.

**Example structure:**
While government and corporate actions have the greatest impact on climate change, individuals play a crucial role both through pressuring governments to adopt strong policies and by making environmentally conscious lifestyle choices.

**But please write it in your own words!**

Go ahead and draft your improved thesis.  
Let me know when you’re ready, or if you’d like another hint!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:33:21.315Z

**You:** Please help me find out topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:39:20.554Z

**Assistant:** Of course! I'm here to help you identify your topic sentences in each body paragraph.

**What is a Topic Sentence?**  
A topic sentence is usually the first sentence in each body paragraph. It introduces the main idea of that paragraph and should connect clearly to the thesis statement.

**Let’s look at your draft's body paragraphs:**

**Body Paragraph 1:**
>The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act...

**Body Paragraph 2:**
>On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter...

So, your **topic sentences** are:

1. **Paragraph 1:** “The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”
2. **Paragraph 2:** “On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.”

**What to do next:**  
- Please choose which paragraph you'd like to revise the topic sentence for (Paragraph 1 or Paragraph 2).
- Let me know your choice, and we’ll move on to Step 2 of the revision process!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:39:23.428Z

**You:** Please help me improved topic sentences and show them to me

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:40:18.295Z

**Assistant:** Great choice—let’s focus on revising your topic sentences together!

**But first, please let me know:**  
- Which paragraph’s topic sentence do you want to work on: **Paragraph 1 (government and politicians)** or **Paragraph 2 (personal lifestyle choices)**?

Once you tell me your choice, I’ll provide feedback on that topic sentence and help you improve it.  
Remember, I won’t re-write the whole sentence, but I’ll help guide you with hints and examples!

**Ready? Just type which paragraph you choose (1 or 2), and let’s get started!**

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:40:25.885Z

**You:** Both

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:40:40.949Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! You’d like to work on both topic sentences. We’ll go step by step and keep the focus clear and manageable.

**Let’s start with Paragraph 1** (‘government and politicians’):

**Original topic sentence:**  
“The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”

**Feedback:**
- Good job—this sentence is clear and introduces the main idea.
- However, “the most important way” could sound a bit subjective (since your thesis talks about both influencing government and making lifestyle choices).
- To match your thesis more closely, try to highlight how influencing the government is a key or effective way individuals contribute, without insisting it is the only or most important one.
- Try to use confident, academic language that links to your updated thesis.

**Would you like to try revising this topic sentence based on these hints?**  
You could, for example, emphasize significance (“One significant way…” or “A key role individuals play is…”), or directly connect it to pressure on policy.

Let me know your attempt!

---

**Once you feel happy with Paragraph 1’s topic sentence, we’ll move to Paragraph 2.**

Just reply with your new topic sentence for Paragraph 1 when you’re ready! If you need a model or more hints, just ask.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:40:45.981Z

**You:** please give me a model

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:45:48.978Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Here’s a **model topic sentence** for Body Paragraph 1, based on your thesis and the feedback:

**Model:**  
“One key way individuals contribute to the fight against climate change is by influencing government policies and decisions.”

**Why this works:**  
- It uses confident and precise language (“key way,” “contribute,” “influencing government policies”).
- It connects clearly to your thesis idea about individuals pressuring governments.
- It does not claim this is the “most important” (which could contradict your balanced thesis), but rather highlights its significance.

**Remember:** Please write your own version in your own words, or adjust this model if you like. When you’re ready, share your revised topic sentence for Paragraph 1—and I’ll help you with the next step!

Would you like to revise and share your new topic sentence now?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:45:52.982Z

**You:** show me the second sentence's improved model

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:48:32.093Z

**Assistant:** Of course! Here’s a **model topic sentence** for Body Paragraph 2, based on your thesis and the feedback:

**Model:**  
“Individuals also play an important role in addressing climate change by adopting environmentally friendly habits in their everyday lives.”

**Why this works:**  
- It uses confident, academic language (“important role,” “addressing climate change”).
- It directly connects to your thesis's second point (personal lifestyle choices).
- It’s clear and introduces the main idea of the paragraph.

**Your Turn:**  
Please try writing your own improved topic sentence for Paragraph 2, either using this as inspiration or adapting it in your own words!

When you’re ready, share your attempt, and I’ll help you with any final adjustments before we move onto revising the rest of the paragraph. Let me know if you want more hints or another example!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:48:35.752Z

**You:** Please help me improve my body paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:50:19.218Z

**Assistant:** Great job so far on revising your thesis and topic sentences! Now, let's move to Step 3: **Revising the Rest of Your Chosen Body Paragraph.**

**Since your last request included model topic sentences for both Paragraph 1 (influencing government policy) and Paragraph 2 (personal green lifestyle choices), could you please confirm which paragraph you want to revise in detail?**

If you’d like to work on **Paragraph 2 (personal lifestyle choices)**, here is your original paragraph:

> On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

**Let’s look at how this paragraph can be improved:**

### 1. Do your supporting sentences clearly relate to the new topic sentence?
- Check: Are your details/examples all about individuals’ green lifestyle choices and their effects?  
- Mostly yes! You mention recycling, using less water, walking, influencing companies, and social influence.

### 2. Is there any evidence, explanation, or connection that could be clearer or more logical?
- “These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter.” Good comparison and transition.
- “It can create a good example for others…” Nice point. Maybe you can explain how this influence spreads—peer pressure, community norms, etc.
- “Send a message to companies…” Good! Maybe clarify how companies respond.
- “But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.” These last sentences could be more clearly connected to your main idea. Try to keep them focused on the *limitations* of individual action, but maybe express it a bit more objectively.

### 3. Sentence structure and vocabulary
- Aim for academic, formal style—avoid “just want to do what is easy, so this is problem.” How can you express this in more formal, precise language?
- Watch for repetition—try to vary vocabulary a bit.

---

**Here are some guiding questions to help you revise:**
- Can you clarify how individual actions influence others and/or companies?
- How would you rephrase the last two sentences to sound more formal and directly connected to your topic?
- Is there a transition to relate these limitations back to your thesis?

**Now, your turn:**  
Would you like to try rewriting or adjusting 2–3 sentences from this paragraph using my suggestions?  
Try focusing first on improving the last two sentences for clarity and academic tone. If you want, you can also expand earlier points!

**Example transformation (not a full sentence):**  
Instead of “people just want to do what is easy, so this is problem,” you could write: “…many individuals may find it challenging to maintain eco-friendly habits if they are not convenient, which limits the overall impact of such actions.”

**Would you like to try revising some sentences now? Let me know which ones you want to work on, and I’ll guide you through!**

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:50:28.692Z

**You:** Please show me the model

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:51:14.590Z

**Assistant:** Of course! Here’s a **model for how you could revise the last part of your paragraph** to be more formal, clear, and academically focused—**but remember, this is NOT a full rewrite, just guidance and sample fragments:**

**Model guidance for ending sentences:**
- Many individuals may find it challenging to adopt environmentally friendly habits if these require extra effort or resources, which can limit the collective impact of such actions.
- Additionally, when only a small portion of the population makes sustainable choices, the effect on climate change remains minimal.

**What makes these effective?**
- They use formal language (“challenging to adopt,” “limit the collective impact,” “minimal effect”).
- They are clearly connected to your topic sentence about individuals’ green habits.
- They objectively explain the *limitations* without sounding too informal or vague.

**Your task:**  
Try to revise your own sentences at the end of the paragraph using this approach.  
- Focus on formal vocabulary.
- Make the limitation of individual action clear and logically connected to your topic.

**Would you like to try now? If so, just draft your new version of those last two sentences—and I’ll help you review and refine!**

Let me know if you need more hints, examples, or a breakdown of specific words/phrases to use.

**Assistant:** Thanks for sticking with the process! It’s great that you want to be thorough, but my role here is to **guide you step-by-step** so you build your own academic writing skills. I’m not allowed to provide fully rewritten paragraphs, but I’ll give you even more **detailed guidance**, feedback, and *examples* so you can revise your own ideas with confidence.

Let’s focus on **Paragraph 2**, continuing from where we left off:  
Here’s your current version of the last two sentences  
> But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

Let’s break this down and revise together for **clarity, academic tone, and stronger connection to your topic sentence**.

### **Step-by-Step Improving the Ending of Paragraph 2**

#### 1. Make the language more formal and precise

- Instead of “people don’t care and just want to do what is easy,” you could say:  
  *Many individuals prioritize convenience over environmental consciousness, which may hinder widespread adoption of green practices.*

- Instead of “only a few people do green things but most people don’t change,” you could say:  
  *If sustainable habits are adopted by only a small fraction of the population, their overall impact on climate change is limited.*

#### 2. Connect these ideas back to the paragraph’s topic sentence

- Recall: Your topic sentence is about individuals playing an important role through everyday choices.
- The rest of the paragraph should show both potential and limitation of such choices.

#### 3. Logical progression—finish with transition to your argument in conclusion

- You might want to end the paragraph with a sentence summarizing why BOTH individual action and wider change are needed, echoing your thesis.

### **Guided Example: How to Build This Ending**

Let’s put these improvements together, but **I’ll only use fragments and models**, so you can finish the sentences yourself!

- “However, … may not be enough to create significant change unless …”
- “Although … have a positive influence, … the effect remains limited unless …”
- “Some individuals … which restricts the overall impact …”

Can you try combining these ideas? Here’s a possible direction:

> “However, even though individual eco-friendly habits can inspire companies and communities to be more sustainable, these efforts may not achieve substantial results unless a large proportion of society participates. Many people may find green habits difficult to maintain, and if only a minority practices them, the effect on climate change will remain limited.”

**Now, your turn:**  
Try to write your own revised ending (two to three sentences) for Paragraph 2 using this guidance and sample fragments.  
Focus on formal language, clear logic, and direct connection to your paragraph’s main idea.

**Would you like to post your revised sentences now?** I’ll give you feedback and help you polish them! If you want to try revising the entire paragraph, do so step by step—start by updating the ending, then we can look at coherence and unity throughout.  
Let me know how you’d like to proceed!
