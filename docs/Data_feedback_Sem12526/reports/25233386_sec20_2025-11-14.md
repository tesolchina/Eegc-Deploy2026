## **Student Training Progress Report – Emphasis on AI Collaboration**

### Completion Check

**Required Revision Tasks:**
1. **Revised Thesis Statement:** **INCOMPLETE**  
The student attempted revision but posted a thesis statement that is both incomplete in scope and inaccurate against the original stance. The thesis did not incorporate nuanced views on citizen influence and personal lifestyle choices. Instead, it stated a rigid position contrary to earlier drafts, lacking integration of AI feedback or previewing key essay points.

2. **Revised Topic Sentence:** **NOT ATTEMPTED**  
No revised topic sentences were provided or discussed in the chat.

3. **Revised Body Paragraph:** **NOT ATTEMPTED**  
No revised body paragraphs or edits demonstrating integration of AI suggestions were submitted.

**Status:** The student has **not finished** the required revision tasks.

---

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

1. **Complete all revision tasks:** Begin with a clear, strong thesis that previews main points, revise topic sentences, and edit paragraphs accordingly.
2. **Use AI feedback actively:** Respond to suggestions by producing new text rather than brief affirmations.
3. **Practice iterative revisions:** Draft, receive AI input, revise, and repeat to build writing confidence.
4. **Seek clarifications and deeper engagement:** Ask questions to clarify AI feedback and explore alternatives.
5. **Utilize rubric criteria:** Align revisions with scoring criteria to target evident improvements.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES

- Student shows initial engagement but requires encouragement to move beyond basic acceptance to active revision.
- Consider additional instructional scaffolding on how to implement AI suggestions into writing.
- Reinforce importance of submitting tangible evidence of revision to demonstrate skill development.

---

**Summary:**  
The student has yet to complete key revision steps required to demonstrate growth in essay writing and AI collaboration within this module. To progress, the student should complete the thesis revision incorporating both key points with a clear stance, revise topic sentences and body paragraphs accordingly, and actively engage in iterative dialogue with the AI. This approach will better showcase improvement and successful human-AI collaboration skills.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:44:09.948Z

**You:** Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do.

**Assistant:** Great! Let's start our revision using the structured process. Step 1 is to focus on your thesis statement.

**Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision**

First, could you please copy and paste your current thesis statement here? (This is usually one or two sentences in your introduction that express your main argument.) Once you share it, I’ll give you some feedback on clarity, strength, and focus, and help you improve it.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:49:09.201Z

**You:** Some people believe that individual actions are insignificant in the fight against climate change compared to the efforts of governments and large corporations. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:53:00.893Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement! Here it is:

> I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

**Feedback:**
- **Clarity:** Your thesis shows your position (partial agreement), which is good! However, the sentence is a bit long and could be more direct.
- **Strength:** The language could be more confident. Try to avoid "I partly agree/I also think..." and focus on making a clear, precise claim.
- **Focus:** It helps to briefly mention the main points you will discuss (influence on government, role of personal choices).

**Suggestions:**
- Make your opinion stand out directly (e.g., "While government and corporate actions are crucial, individual actions remain significant because citizens can influence policy and set environmental examples.")
- Preview the structure: mention both influencing government and personal lifestyle choices.
- Use confident and academic language.

**Your Turn:**  
Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now, using these suggestions? You can keep it one or two sentences, focusing on clarity and confidence. When you’re ready, post your revised thesis here and I’ll review it with you!

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:53:04.230Z

**You:** ok do you mean the first i send to you？

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:57:14.633Z

**Assistant:** Great question! Yes, I mean the thesis statement from your introduction—the sentence that expresses your main argument about the topic. In your draft, it currently reads:

> I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

Now, could you try revising this thesis to make it:
- Clear and confident (no “I think/I partly agree”).
- Directly answer the essay question.
- Briefly mention your two main points: citizens influencing government and the role of personal choices.

Go ahead and give it a try!  
When you’re ready, post your revised version here and I’ll give you feedback.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:57:23.398Z

**You:** i agree

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:58:10.500Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for responding! I appreciate that you’re ready to revise.  
Just to confirm, could you please share your new version of the thesis statement, using the feedback provided? Try to make it:

- Direct and confident (without “I agree,” “I think,” etc.).
- Focused on the two key points: citizens influencing government, and personal green lifestyle choices.
- One or two strong sentences.

Would you like to write and post your revised thesis statement now? I’m here to help review it and give you feedback!

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:58:12.949Z

**You:** i agree that individual actions are insignificant in the fight against climate change compared to the efforts of governments and large corporations.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:59:31.166Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your revised thesis statement:

> "i agree that individual actions are insignificant in the fight against climate change compared to the efforts of governments and large corporations."

**Encouraging Feedback:**
- **Clarity:** Your position is clear and direct, which is excellent!
- **Strength:** The tone is assertive, good job.
- **Focus:** It clearly answers the question, but it does not preview your supporting points (citizens influencing government, personal lifestyle choices).

**Suggested Next Steps:**  
To make your thesis statement even stronger for academic writing, try:
- Capitalizing "I" (for a formal tone).
- Briefly mentioning the two main ways individuals *do* or *do not* make a difference—alluding to your points on influencing governments and personal habits.
- Showing nuance: Even if you say government/corporations matter more, acknowledge that individuals still have some influence (as you discuss in the body paragraphs).

**Guiding Questions:**  
- How can you mention both citizens influencing government and personal green choices, even if you believe these are less important than government and corporate actions?
- Can you write one sentence that previews these two main ideas?

**Would you like to try revising your thesis again** with these hints? I encourage you to include both supporting points so your reader knows what to expect in your essay.

When you’re ready, please post your next version here—I’ll review and support you!
