            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your paragraph and topic sentence! Since you chose the paragraph about citizens influencing the government, here’s a suggested revision for the topic sentence that connects well to a more assertive thesis and previews your argument clearly:

**Revised Topic Sentence Example:**  
“Citizens play a crucial role in combating climate change by influencing government policies and encouraging political leaders to enact stronger environmental protections.”

This revision:  
- Uses confident, academic language.  
- Clearly links citizen action to government influence.  
- Directly previews the paragraph’s content.

Would you like to try rewriting your topic sentence in this style? If you share your revision, I can provide feedback before we move on to revising the rest of the paragraph for clarity, grammar, and impact.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 – The essay presents two relevant perspectives regarding individual and governmental/company roles in climate change. Arguments are generally clear and adequately developed, though depth and originality could be improved.
- Organization: 20/25 – The essay is generally well-organized, with clear paragraphing and logical progression. Minor lapses in clarity and more explicit signposting would help.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 – Vocabulary is appropriate but sometimes repetitive and occasionally imprecise (e.g., “this is problem,” “nothing happen”). Some topic-specific terms used, mostly adequate.
- Grammar: 17/25 – Sentence structure is mostly simple, with several minor errors (“maybe just listen a little,” “so is not always working well,” missing articles and verb forms) that affect clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 76/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 – No substantive changes; arguments and ideas remain the same as in the original.
- Organization: 20/25 – Organization unchanged; no new transitions or restructuring.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 – Vocabulary usage and variety remain the same.
- Grammar: 17/25 – No revision was made to sentence structures or errors.
- **Revised Essay Total: 76/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - No actual revision found in thesis statement, topic sentence, or body paragraph. Texts are identical.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Student did not revise thesis statement with assertive or academic language as prompted.
  - No revision or strengthening of body paragraph topic sentence.
  - No improvement of grammar, vocabulary, or paragraph structure.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 11**
- **Conversation Quality:** The student participated in a training dialogue that guided them through the revision process step-by-step. The assistant offered iterative advice, but the student did not respond with substantive revisions—mostly deferred or skipped steps (“let’s move on”).

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 – The exchange sequence is present, but lacks depth; the student did not elaborate on ideas, ask in-depth questions, or engage critically. Most student replies are brief and procedural.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 – Student did not engage with or critically assess AI feedback or suggestions; all assistant feedback bypassed without reflection.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 – No meaningful revision cycles occurred; student moved quickly from one step to another without performing actual revisions to thesis, topic sentence, or body paragraph.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 4/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student engaged with the AI assistant and followed the procedural steps of the training module.
- The essay shows initial understanding of content organization and basic essay construction.
- The student identified thesis and topic sentences when prompted.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Revise the thesis statement to feature assertive, academic language and preview both arguments, per AI guidance.
- Actually revise a topic sentence to explicitly connect body paragraph to thesis.
- Make substantial changes in body paragraph (structure, clarity, grammar) after discussing with AI, rather than moving forward without editing.
- Engage critically with AI feedback rather than just proceeding to the next step.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement – Student provided minimal course context, largely responding only to direct prompts without reflective detail.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement – No evidence of planning revision strategy; student skipped revision tasks rather than organizing steps.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement – Did not critically evaluate or respond to AI feedback at any stage.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement – No independent edits or revisions were made.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Take time to apply AI feedback to substantive writing changes—don’t skip revision steps.
2. Practice giving more detailed responses and reflect on feedback; try rephrasing and rewriting statements for clarity and assertiveness.
3. Treat each revision step as an opportunity to develop both writing and analytical skills—engage in meaningful iteration for improvement.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
Student made progress with AI interaction structure but did not complete key revision steps (thesis, topic sentence, body paragraph). For future sessions, encourage more thoughtful engagement with feedback and require actual text changes rather than moving ahead procedurally. Consider pairing with peer review or additional writing support.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:48:31.202Z

**You:** Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:54:35.308Z

**Assistant:** Great job sharing your thesis statement! Let’s begin Step 1: **Thesis Statement Revision.**

Here’s your current thesis statement:

> Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

**Feedback:**
- **Clarity:** Your thesis explains your partial agreement and introduces two main points: citizens influencing the government, and the role of personal choices. This is good!
- **Strength:** The language could be more confident. Avoid “I partly agree…” and “I also think...” Try to make your position clear and direct.
- **Focus:** Consider previewing how you will support each side (government influence and individual choices).
- **Essay Question:** Does the thesis directly answer the essay prompt? (Is it about the importance of individual actions vs. government/company action?)
- **Preview:** Does your thesis preview the essay’s structure? (Government influence and personal lifestyle.)

**Revision Tips:**
- Use assertive, academic language.
- State your viewpoint clearly and directly.
- Specify that you’ll discuss both the influence of citizens on the government and the impact of personal green habits.

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now, making it more confident and clearly previewing the two main arguments you'll discuss? If you want, you can share your revised version and I'll give you more feedback!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:54:39.731Z

**You:** lets move on to step two

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:04:58.015Z

**Assistant:** Great! Since you’re ready for Step 2, let’s focus on revising a body paragraph’s topic sentence.

**Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**

First, please tell me which body paragraph you’d like to work on:
- The paragraph about citizens influencing the government, **or**
- The paragraph about individuals making small changes (personal green choices)?

Once you’ve chosen, please copy and paste that paragraph's topic sentence here. Then, I’ll give you feedback and help you revise it so it clearly connects to your updated thesis.

Which paragraph would you like to focus on?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:05:02.319Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:06:19.142Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your revised thesis statement:

> I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

**Feedback on your revised thesis:**

- **Clarity:** You clearly state your position (partly agreeing). Well done!  
- **Strength:** Try to use more assertive, academic language. Phrases like “I partly agree” and “I also think” sound a bit uncertain. Instead, make your stance clear and confident.
- **Focus/Preview:** It’s good that you mention both citizens influencing government and personal green choices. Make sure you preview how you’ll address these two points.

**Suggestions to strengthen your thesis:**
- Replace “I partly agree” with a more assertive phrase, such as “While government and corporate actions play the most significant role in addressing climate change, citizens also have important influence both through political participation and personal lifestyle changes.”
- Clearly preview your two main supporting points.
- Avoid phrases like “I think” — just make the statement.

**Guiding question:**  
Would you like to try revising your thesis to use more assertive language and to preview both points (citizen influence on government and personal lifestyle choices) more directly?  

If you’d like, you can post your revised thesis and I’ll give you quick feedback before we move on to Step 2!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:06:23.285Z

**You:** ;lets move on to step 3

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:08:28.337Z

**Assistant:** Great energy! Before we move to Step 3, we need to make sure Step 2 (revising the topic sentence for your chosen body paragraph) is completed. This step-by-step process helps your essay maintain strong organization and focus.

Here’s where we are:
- **Step 1:** You worked on revising the thesis statement and got feedback.
- **Step 2:** Now, you need to choose which body paragraph you want to focus on and revise its topic sentence so it clearly connects to your updated thesis.

**Quick check-in:**
1. Please let me know which paragraph you want to improve:
    - The paragraph about **citizens influencing the government**
    - OR the paragraph about **personal green choices**
2. Copy and paste the **topic sentence** from that paragraph here.

**Let’s complete that quick revision**, then we’ll move to revising the rest of the paragraph in Step 3!  
Would you like to pick your paragraph and share its topic sentence now?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:08:32.339Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act.

Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:08:51.898Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! You’ve chosen to work on the paragraph about **citizens influencing the government**. Let's start with that paragraph’s **topic sentence**:

> The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

**Feedback on the Topic Sentence:**
- **Connection to Thesis:** The sentence introduces the idea, but now that your thesis will be more assertive, the topic sentence can also sound more purposeful.
- **Clarity/Focus:** “Most important” is strong, but your thesis suggests that government influence is *highly significant*, not necessarily *the most* important compared to all other actions. Clarity will help.
- **Direct Preview:** Consider directly stating how citizens have the power to bring about real change through collective political action.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
- Use confident language to mirror your new thesis.
- Clearly state that influencing governmental action is a powerful way individuals can address climate change.
- Try to avoid vague phrases like “the most important way”—instead, frame it as “a key way” or “one of the most effective ways.”

**Guiding Question:**  
Would you like to revise your topic sentence now, so it clearly connects to your updated and more assertive thesis?

If you’d like, you can post your revised topic sentence here. I’ll give you quick feedback and, once it’s clear and connected, we’ll move on to revising the rest of your paragraph.

**Tip:** Try to include words like “citizens,” “influence,” “governmental action,” and “climate change.”

Would you like to give your revised topic sentence a try?
