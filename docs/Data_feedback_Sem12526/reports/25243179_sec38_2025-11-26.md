            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your essay and the assessment report summary. Here’s a concise overview and next steps to help you build on your progress:

---

**Summary of Your Revision Work:**

- You successfully revised your thesis to be clearer, more direct, and preview your argument points.
- You rewrote the manufacturing/production paragraph for better grammar, vocabulary, and logical flow—now it explains how automation replaces routine tasks but creates new technical and monitoring jobs.
- You made notable grammar and phrasing improvements in these revised sections.

**Areas Still Needing Attention:**

- The paragraph on music and arts and your conclusion were not revised and still have grammar, word choice, and idiomatic errors (e.g., “In the other sides,” “their works can’t be replaced by robot,” “ultermately”).
- Your essay lacks concrete examples or evidence that would make your claims stronger.
- Transitions can be improved to make the essay flow more smoothly.
- You could benefit from practicing rewriting unedited parts yourself before asking for AI help to deepen your editing skills and critical evaluation.

---

**Key Recommendations for Your Next Steps:**

1. **Revise the Music/Arts Paragraph:**
   - Fix grammar and idiomatic phrases.
   - Strengthen the connection to your thesis by emphasizing why these industries are less automatable.
   - Example: replace “In the other sides,” with “On the other hand,” and “their works can’t be replaced by robot” with “work in music and the arts cannot be fully automated.”

2. **Revise the Conclusion:**
   - Eliminate redundancy (avoid repeating “in the long run” and “ultimately”).
   - Tighten the sentence for impact and clarity.

3. **Add an Example or Evidence:**
   - Include a short, concrete example (e.g., "For instance, factory technicians are now in demand to maintain automated equipment.") to support your claims.
   - Alternatively, a brief statistic or real-world observation would also work.

4. **Engage in Active Revision Practice:**
   - Try rewriting one or two sentences from the unedited paragraphs yourself and share them.
   - Request specific feedback on your rewrites so you gain confidence making changes independently.
   - This will also develop your critical thinking and editing judgment.

5. **Improve Transitions and Organization:**
   - Consider using transitional phrases like “Furthermore,” “Additionally,” or “Moreover” to clarify relationships between paragraphs.
   - This will create a smoother logical progression.

---

**If you’d like, I can:**

- Help you revise the music/arts paragraph and conclusion with grammar and clarity improvements.
- Suggest a concrete example or guide you in drafting one.
- Provide feedback on sentences you revise yourself from the remaining text.

Would you prefer to focus next on revising the music/arts paragraph and conclusion — or work on adding examples first? Or do you want to try rewriting a few sentences for feedback before further edits? Just let me know how you’d like to proceed!

            ## 🟤 Grading Result *(Hidden from Students)*

            All three required revision tasks were completed: the student (with AI help) revised the thesis statement, revised a topic sentence, and revised one body paragraph.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The original expresses a clear, optimistic stance that automation will improve employment in the long term ("From my perspective, I think the technological shift by automation is going to enhance the global employment prospects ultimately in the long term."), but development is general with little concrete evidence or examples.
- Organization: 17/25 - Basic essay structure is present (intro, body paragraphs, conclusion), but paragraph-level topic sentences and transitions are weak ("Some industries, like production industries,may have some new job opportunities."), producing uneven logical flow.
- Vocabulary: 16/25 - Vocabulary is adequate but limited and sometimes imprecise (e.g., "works might be replaced by robot", "the other sides"). Errors and awkward collocations reduce clarity.
- Grammar: 15/25 - Frequent grammatical, punctuation, and spelling errors (e.g., "does it means," "ultermately," missing spaces after commas) that at times impair smooth reading.
- **Original Essay Total: 66/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - Thesis is clearer and more specific in the revision ("Automation is transforming industries, and although it may reduce some routine jobs, it will enhance global employment prospects in the long term by creating new technical, monitoring, and maintenance roles while increasing demand for skilled workers in emerging sectors."), and the manufacturing paragraph provides clearer reasons. Still, claims remain general and could benefit from concrete examples or data.
- Organization: 19/25 - The revised thesis and the rewritten production paragraph improve cohesion and logical progression. Remaining paragraphs (music/art and conclusion) were left largely unchanged, so the overall organization is improved but not consistently strong across the essay.
- Vocabulary: 19/25 - Vocabulary and word choice improved in the revised thesis and production paragraph (e.g., "monitoring, maintenance, and systems management"), though some odd phrasings and imprecisions persist in the unchanged paragraphs.
- Grammar: 18/25 - Noticeable grammatical corrections in the revised paragraph and thesis (removed hedging, fixed verb forms, clearer sentence structures). However, unedited sections still contain errors (e.g., "In the other sides," missing commas, final sentence redundancies).
- **Revised Essay Total: 76/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +10 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis statement made direct, specific, and previewing ("Automation is transforming industries... will enhance global employment prospects... creating new technical, monitoring, and maintenance roles...").
  - Topic sentence and body paragraph on manufacturing/production rewritten for clarity and unity: the paragraph now explains how automation replaces repetitive tasks but creates monitoring, troubleshooting, and maintenance roles.
  - Grammar and phrasing improved in revised sentences (reduced hedging, corrected verb forms, clearer nouns and parallel structures).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The music/arts paragraph and the conclusion were left mostly as in the original and still contain grammatical and idiomatic errors ("In the other sides," "their works can’t be replaced by robot or system," "ultermately"). These should be revised for consistency.
  - Development could be strengthened by adding one concrete example or brief evidence (e.g., a real job role, a sector statistic, or a short hypothetical) to support the claims.
  - Reduce redundancy in the conclusion and tighten overall coherence (avoid repeating "in the long run" and "ultimately" in one sentence).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 7** (assistant → user → assistant → user → assistant → user → assistant)
- **Conversation Quality:** Structured, goal-oriented guidance from the AI. The assistant provided a clear three-step revision plan, a diagnostic, then completed the agreed revision when the student asked it to "Do it for me please." The student engaged but mostly accepted and deferred to the AI without substantial independent critique or multiple revision attempts.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - The chat shows a focused interaction with a clear plan and several useful exchanges (e.g., assistant outlined Step 1–3, asked clarifying questions). However, the total number of turns is limited and the student did not pursue multiple rounds of iterative changes or deeper conceptual questions.
  - Evidence: Assistant offered a full revision plan and diagnostics (first assistant message), and later provided completed revisions when requested.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - The student largely accepted the AI's guidance and asked the assistant to perform the revisions ("Do it for me please") rather than critically evaluating options or rejecting/adjusting suggestions.
  - Evidence: After the assistant proposed focusing choices, the student requested the assistant to do the work rather than proposing their own revisions or pushing back on suggestions.
- **Refining Process**: 3/5 - There is evidence of a revision cycle: the assistant proposed steps and executed them; the student asked for examples of errors and received explicit correction guidance. However, the student did not demonstrate multiple rounds of self-led rewrites or iterative critique.
  - Evidence: The assistant completed the three-step revision and gave examples of frequent errors; the student asked for error examples but did not produce subsequent rewrites in the chat.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 8/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Student expresses a clear position and purpose (optimistic stance on automation and employment), which is consistent across drafts.
- Effective use of AI: The student accepted a structured revision process and obtained concrete improvements (clearer thesis and a substantially improved production paragraph).
- Meaning is generally recoverable despite language errors; the student communicates ideas that can be refined into stronger academic writing.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Increase independent critical engagement with AI suggestions: attempt own rewrites first, question alternatives, and selectively adopt suggestions.
- Revise remaining paragraphs and conclusion for grammatical accuracy and coherence to achieve consistency across the essay.
- Develop content with at least one concrete example or brief evidence to strengthen claims and credibility.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The chat revealed a potential task mismatch (assistant asked whether the assignment was climate-change related), and the student did not clarify course prompt alignment. The student provided the essay but did not supply extra assignment context.
  - Evidence: Assistant explicitly asked: "Did you mean to write about automation, or do you want to rewrite to match the climate-change prompt?" The student proceeded without clarifying the assignment context.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student accepted a clear, structured plan (three-step process) and the assistant implemented it.
  - Evidence: Assistant's stepwise plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) was executed.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student did not critically evaluate or selectively challenge AI suggestions.
  - Evidence: User response "Do it for me please" indicates acceptance rather than evaluation.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The student relied on the AI to perform revisions rather than attempting and iterating independent edits within the chat.
  - Evidence: After receiving diagnostic feedback and error examples, the student did not present own rewrites for further targeted feedback.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise the remaining paragraphs and conclusion for grammar, punctuation, and idiomatic expression (e.g., change "In the other sides" → "On the other hand"; "their works can’t be replaced by robot" → "work in music and the arts cannot be fully automated").
2. Add at least one concrete example or brief evidence (a specific job role, a real-world company change, or a statistic) to support the central claim and make the argument more persuasive.
3. Engage more actively in the revision cycle: attempt at least one self-rewrite of a sentence or paragraph before asking the AI to revise; evaluate and justify which AI suggestions you accept or modify.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student completed the three required revision tasks (thesis, topic sentence, and one body paragraph) and improved the essay's clarity and grammar in those areas.
- The student tended to defer to the AI for revisions rather than practicing independent rewriting and critical evaluation—this is an important learning opportunity for developing autonomous editing skills.
- Ensure the student confirms assignment alignment in future sessions (the assistant flagged a possible mismatch with a climate-change prompt). If the assignment required a different topic, the student should be advised to realign content appropriately.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
From my perspective, I think the technological shift by automation is going to enhance the global employment prospects ultimately in the long term. It is true that the automation is transforming industries, and potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency, but does it means we are going to lose our job? Absolutely not!

Some industries, like production industries,may have some new job opportunities. Although works might be replaced by robot and the whole production line might be automatic, it still needs some people monitoring the whole process. High efficiency doesn’t mean things will be done 100% correctly. It still needs someone monitoring the work and it is essential. People can be easily employed once the work load and the requirements of being required reduced. 

In the other sides, some industries such as music industries,and art industries,their works can’t be replaced by robot or system. Music and arts requires ideas,which can’t be quantified. They can really touch people’s heart.

In conclusion,this technology shifts will ultermately enhance the global employment prospects in long term .

Revised:
In my view, the technological transformation brought about by automation will ultimately improve global employment prospects in the long run. Admittedly, automation is changing various industries, increasing efficiency while potentially reducing some jobs. But does this mean we will lose our jobs? Of course not!

Some industries, such as manufacturing, may create new employment opportunities. Although some jobs may be replaced by robots, and entire production lines may be automated, people will still need to monitor the process. High efficiency does not mean everything will be done 100% correctly. Monitoring the work is still crucial. Once the workload and the requirements for employees decrease, people will find it easier to find jobs.

On the other hand, some industries, such as music and art, cannot be replaced by robots or systems. Music and art require intangible creativity that truly touches the heart.

In short, in the long run, this technological transformation will ultimately improve global employment prospects.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:33:36.371Z

**You:** Help me to due with my grammar and wrong words

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:48:23.260Z

**Assistant:** Great — thank you for the draft and for saying what you want help with. Before we start revising, let’s agree on what to focus on and quickly diagnose the essay so we work on the right things.

1) Quick check-in — goals
- You wrote: “Help me to due with my grammar and wrong words.” Is your priority:
  a) Fixing grammar and word choice (spelling, verb forms, articles, prepositions), or
  b) Also improving clarity/organization and making your thesis answer the assignment?
- Note: The assignment prompt asks about individual actions vs. governments/corporations on climate change, but your essay is about automation and employment. Did you mean to write about automation, or do you want to rewrite to match the climate-change prompt?

Tell me:
- Which of the two topics do you want to work on (automation/employment or climate change)?
- And confirm that your priority is grammar + word choice (and whether you want thesis alignment included).

2) Short diagnostic feedback (using rubric categories)
- Thesis & Argument
  - Problem: The current thesis says automation will improve employment in the long term, but it begins with hedging (“From my perspective, I think”) and doesn’t clearly preview the essay’s main points. Also, it doesn’t match the climate-change prompt (if that was the intended task).
  - Strength: You have a clear stance (optimistic about jobs).

- Organization
  - Problem: Paragraph structure is present but transitions are weak. Topic sentences are vague or missing strong links to a clear thesis.
  - Strength: You have two separate body ideas (production and creative industries).

- Evidence & Development
  - Problem: Claims are general and need clearer examples or explanation (e.g., how automation creates monitoring jobs).
  - Strength: You attempt contrast between industries, which is useful.

- Language Use (this ties to your stated priority)
  - Problems: many grammar and word-choice issues (articles, plural/singular, verb forms, punctuation, spelling — e.g., “does it means,” “works might be replaced,” “In the other sides,” “ultermately”).
  - Strength: Meaning is usually recoverable; your voice is readable and direct.

3) Decide priorities
From the diagnosis I suggest we focus on:
- A: Aligning and improving the thesis (clear, confident, previews main points)
- B: Grammar and word choice in one paragraph (as you asked)
Tell me which of these you want to work on now (A, B, or both). If both, we’ll do the prescribed three-step process.

If you pick both, we’ll start Step 1 now:

Step 1 — Thesis
- Please paste the sentence you want to use as your thesis (you already have one; copy it here exactly if you want me to comment).
- Quick feedback on your current thesis (two brief points to guide your rewrite):
  1) Remove hedging (“From my perspective,” “I think”) — make it direct and confident.
  2) Make it specific and preview two or three main points you will discuss (e.g., automation creates monitoring/maintenance jobs; automation can increase demand for new roles; creative industries are hard to automate).
- Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Try one sentence that answers the task (and if you meant the climate prompt, answer that instead — tell me which prompt you’ll answer). After you write a revision, I’ll give targeted correction suggestions.

Step 2 — Choose one body paragraph
- Which paragraph do you want to revise for grammar and word choice: the paragraph about production industries (monitoring/automation) or the paragraph about music and arts? Pick one.

Step 3 — Work on that paragraph
- After you pick, paste the paragraph (or the topic sentence if you want to start small). I’ll help you revise the topic sentence to connect to the revised thesis, then we’ll work through the supporting sentences with short, focused prompts and corrections. I’ll encourage you to attempt rewrites first and then give hints and small corrections.

Next action from you:
- Confirm the topic (automation or climate prompt).
- Confirm priorities (thesis alignment + grammar/word choice?).
- Paste your thesis (or say you want to keep the one you have) and tell me which paragraph you want to work on.

I’ll wait for your reply — then we’ll start Step 1.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:48:52.626Z

**You:** Do it for me please

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:49:20.311Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I’ll take the lead now. I’ll assume you want to keep the automation/employment topic and that your main priorities are: 1) make the thesis clear, confident, and preview the main points; and 2) fix grammar/word choice in one body paragraph (the production paragraph). If you’d like a different paragraph or the climate-change prompt instead, tell me now and I’ll stop.

I’ve completed the three-step revision (thesis + topic sentence + that paragraph). Below I show the full revised essay (only the thesis sentence and the first body paragraph are changed; I kept your other paragraphs as you wrote them so we stay within the agreed scope). After the essay I’ll note what I changed and suggest next steps.

Revised essay (full text)

Automation is transforming industries, and although it may reduce some routine jobs, it will enhance global employment prospects in the long term by creating new technical, monitoring, and maintenance roles while increasing demand for skilled workers in emerging sectors. It is true that the automation is transforming industries, and potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency, but does it means we are going to lose our job? Absolutely not!

In manufacturing and other production industries, automation often replaces repetitive tasks but also creates new jobs in monitoring, maintenance, and systems management. Although robots and automated production lines can perform many routine operations, humans are still needed to oversee the systems, troubleshoot errors, and carry out complex maintenance. High efficiency does not guarantee perfect results; people are essential to monitor operations, interpret unexpected problems, and ensure quality control. As production requirements change and automation spreads, employers will seek workers with different technical skills, which can create new employment opportunities overall.

In the other sides, some industries such as music industries,and art industries,their works can’t be replaced by robot or system. Music and arts requires ideas,which can’t be quantified. They can really touch people’s heart.

In conclusion,this technology shifts will ultermately enhance the global employment prospects in long term .
---

What I changed and why (brief)
- Thesis: I removed hedging (“From my perspective, I think”) and made the thesis direct and specific. It now answers the likely essay task (clear stance) and previews the main points you discuss (creation of technical/monitoring roles and demand for skilled workers).
- Production paragraph (topic sentence + rest): I rewrote the topic sentence so it clearly links to the new thesis. I rewrote the supporting sentences for grammar, clarity, unity, and to give clearer reasons/examples for how automation creates new jobs (monitoring, troubleshooting, maintenance, skills demand).

Next steps (pick one)
- I can help you revise the music/art paragraph (fix grammar and strengthen connection to the thesis).
- Or I can copy-edit the remaining paragraphs and conclusion for grammar, punctuation, and word choice.
- Or we can expand one paragraph with a concrete example (e.g., a factory maintenance role, or an upskilling program).

Which would you like to do next? If you want more changes now, tell me which option and I’ll proceed.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:49:55.430Z

**You:** Gimme some examples of errors

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:50:28.345Z

**Assistant:** Great — nice, specific request. Here are clear examples of the most common errors in your draft, with a short explanation and a brief correction for each. I’ll keep each correction short so you can try similar fixes yourself.

1) Hedging / weak opening
- Original: “From my perspective, I think the technological shift…” 
- Problem: Redundant hedging (weakens stance).
- Fix: Remove the hedging words — start with the claim directly (e.g., begin with “Automation…”).

2) Subject–verb agreement after auxiliaries
- Original: “but does it means we are going to lose our job?”
- Problem: After the auxiliary does, the base verb is required.
- Fix: change “means” → “mean” (or rephrase: “does that mean…”).

3) Countable/plural nouns and wrong word form
- Original: “works might be replaced by robot”
- Problems: “works” is wrong here; “robot” should be plural or use “robots”; better word is “workers” or “work done by robots.”
- Fix: use “workers” or “robots” (e.g., “workers might be replaced by robots” or “work might be done by robots”).

4) Articles and general nouns
- Original: “the automation is transforming industries”
- Problem: Using “the” makes it specific; we usually talk about automation generally.
- Fix: drop “the” → “Automation is transforming industries.”

5) Missing spaces / punctuation errors
- Original: “production industries,may have” and “In conclusion,this technology”
- Problem: Missing space after comma.
- Fix: add space after commas and periods.

6) Awkward phrasing / unclear reference
- Original: “It still needs someone monitoring the work and it is essential.”
- Problem: “It” is vague and sentence order is awkward.
- Fix: replace vague pronoun with the idea (e.g., “Human monitoring is still essential.”) — try to make the subject clear.

7) Word choice and redundancy
- Original: “People can be easily employed once the work load and the requirements of being required reduced.”
- Problems: “work load” format, “requirements of being required” is confused and redundant.
- Fix: use “workload” and simplify: “if entry requirements are reduced” or “if employers lower required qualifications.” (Aim for a clear, single idea.)

8) Preposition / idiom
- Original: “In the other sides,”
- Problem: Not idiomatic.
- Fix: use “On the other hand,” or “In other sectors,” depending on meaning.

9) Plural/singular and article agreement
- Original: “some industries such as music industries,and art industries,their works can’t be replaced”
- Problems: repetition of “industries,” comma issues, and “their works” is awkward.
- Fix: simplify: “Some fields, such as music and the arts, cannot be replaced by machines.” (Keep noun forms parallel.)

10) Spelling and form
- Original: “ultermately”
- Fix: “ultimately.”

11) Tone and precision
- Original: “High efficiency doesn’t mean things will be done 100% correctly.”
- Problem: informal and a bit vague.
- Fix: “High efficiency does not guarantee perfect results.” (Use precise language in essays.)

Quick practice offer
Would you like to try correcting three sentences now? Pick any three lines from your draft and paste them — I’ll prompt you with 1–2 hints per sentence, then you can rewrite and I’ll give targeted feedback.
