            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your thesis and engaging in this revision process!

Since you haven't posted a revised thesis statement yet, I encourage you to try rewriting it now using the guidance above. Here’s a quick starting point you can adapt:

*"While government and corporate actions are crucial in combating climate change, individuals play a vital role both by influencing policymakers and through their personal lifestyle choices, which together contribute to environmental progress."*

Feel free to rewrite this in your own words or improve it, then share your version here. Once you do, I’ll help you refine it further before moving on to revising a topic sentence.  

Looking forward to seeing your revision!

- **Organization:** 20/25 – The essay has clear introduction, body, and conclusion, and ideas are organized logically. Some transitions and connections between ideas could be stronger.
- **Vocabulary:** 18/25 – Vocabulary is adequate and generally appropriate. Some topic-specific terms are used (“environmental laws,” “carbon emissions”), but there are some awkward or repetitive phrases.
- **Grammar:** 17/25 – Sentence structure is basic. Some grammatical errors (“so is not always working well,” “so nothing happen”) slightly impede clarity, though main ideas are generally understandable.
- **Original Essay Total:** **75/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

**Assistant:** Great! We're going to work step by step to help you revise your essay using the three-step revision process. Let’s begin with Step 1:

---

**Step 1: Revise the Thesis Statement**

Please share your current thesis statement.  
(Reminder: The thesis statement is usually found at the end of your introduction and clearly states your position on the essay question.)

**Once you've shared it, we’ll:**
- Discuss how clear and focused it is
- Check if it answers the essay question and previews your main points
- Suggest how you could make it stronger and more confident

**Would you please copy and paste your current thesis statement here?**

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:57:01.529Z

**You:** In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:58:46.295Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement! Just to clarify, your thesis statement should usually appear at the end of your introduction, not in your conclusion. Based on your essay, I believe this is your current thesis statement (from the introduction):

> "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Here’s some feedback:

**Clarity & Focus:**
- Your thesis shows your position (partly agreeing) and mentions both individual actions and influencing the government. Good job!
- The sentence feels a little long and could be more direct.
- “I partly agree…” could be replaced with a more confident stance (try not to use “I think” or “I agree/disagree” unless required by your teacher).

**Previewing Main Points:**
- It mentions citizens influencing government and individual lifestyle choices, which matches your body paragraphs.
- Maybe mention that government/company actions are most impactful, but individuals still play a supporting role, for even clearer structure.

**Confidence & Precision:**
- Try using precise, assertive language (“Citizens play a crucial role…” instead of “I partly agree…”).
- You can eliminate uncertainty words to make your thesis statement stronger.

**Your Turn!**
Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement using these suggestions?  
Here’s a quick planning prompt:  
- Clearly answer the question: “Do individuals’ actions matter in fighting climate change, compared to governments and companies?”
- Preview your two main points: 1) Individuals can influence government action; 2) Personal choices still have an impact.

You can post your revision here, and I’ll give feedback before we move to Step 2!
