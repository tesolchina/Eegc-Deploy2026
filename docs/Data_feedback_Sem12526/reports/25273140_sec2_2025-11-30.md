# TRAINING ASSESSMENT REPORT  
## Student Assessment: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship  
### Module: AI for Revising Essays

---

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

**Original Essay:**  
- Content and Ideas: Clear position on climate change and individual vs. government roles. Relevant but undeveloped reasons and examples.  
- Organization: Logical paragraph order but some repetition and weak transitions.  
- Vocabulary: Adequate but repetitive and sometimes imprecise.  
- Grammar: Frequent errors and awkward phrasing reduce clarity.  
- Overall: The essay communicates ideas but with limited depth and some English language weaknesses.

**Revised Essay (Submitted Draft):**  
- Content and Ideas: Incomplete draft mostly placeholder text, shifts focus to migrant workers but without a clear thesis or developed arguments.  
- Organization: Fragmented—missing logical flow and proper paragraph development.  
- Vocabulary: Contains inconsistent, awkward phrasing and placeholders (“bla bla bla”).  
- Grammar: Numerous sentence fragments and grammar mistakes.  
- Overall: The essay remains unfinished, lacks evidence, and does not reliably support any thesis.

---

### ESSAY IMPROVEMENT ANALYSIS

- **Overall Change:** Negative due to fragmentary revision and topic drift without concrete revision steps.  
- **Attempted Strengths:** The student showed willingness to shift topic to migrant worker rights, posed relevant social/economic angles, and engaged with the assistant’s scaffolded steps.  
- **Missed Opportunities:** 
   - Did not provide a confirmed revised thesis statement, blocking coherence for further revisions.  
   - Topic sentences and paragraphs were left as placeholders, with no full revisions produced.  
   - No inclusion of specific examples or evidence to support claims.

---

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

**Chat Summary:**  
- The assistant consistently requested the revised thesis statement (a required first step) and provided detailed guidance to improve it.  
- The student repeatedly evaded pasting a new thesis, instead replying with “let’s pretend we have revised…”—thus halting substantive progress.  
- The assistant then relayed clear next steps (topic sentence revision) contingent on thesis confirmation, but the student did not provide concrete text for further review.  

**Interaction Scores:**  
- In-Depth Conversation: Moderate — multi-step guidance given; student engagement was surface-level without real revision content.  
- Critical Review of AI Suggestions: Limited — student accepted suggestions verbally but did not apply or critique them meaningfully.  
- Refining Process: Minimal — student did not submit iterations for feedback, limiting the refinement cycle.

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

**Strengths:**  
- The student engaged with the revision workflow conceptually and picked a paragraph to revise.  
- The assistant offered high-quality scaffolding with clear checklists and templates.  
- The student expressed awareness of weaknesses in the original thesis and seemed open to changing topic.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- **Produce Concrete Revisions:** Actual revised thesis statements, topic sentences, and paragraphs are essential for effective feedback. Hypothetical or placeholder text prevents meaningful progress.  
- **Critical Engagement:** The student should actively test, modify, or question AI advice rather than passively accepting or sidestepping it.  
- **Support and Structure:** Insert concrete examples and clearer cause-effect reasoning to support claims in paragraphs.  
- **Grammar and Precision:** Work on clearer English expression and sentence completeness.

---

### AI COLLABORATION SKILLS

- **Context Provision:** Needs improvement — the student gave a broad topic but did not supply the key required input texts (revised thesis and paragraphs).  
- **Strategic Planning:** Moderate — student seemed to understand the steps but did not follow through with the necessary outputs.  
- **Critical Evaluation:** Minimal — limited evidence of student reasoning about suggestions, choices, or alternative phrasing.  
- **Independent Editing:** Minimal — no actual revised paragraphs provided, only placeholders.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

1. **Submit Revision Artifacts:** Always provide the exact revised thesis, topic sentence, and full body paragraph for targeted AI assistance. Avoid placeholders or hypothetical statements.  
2. **Use and Adapt Templates Actively:** Generate multiple thesis alternatives, compare, and request feedback to practice critical evaluation and refinement.  
3. **Support Claims with Evidence:** Add specific facts, policies, or examples to make arguments persuasive.  
4. **Proofread and Edit:** Run grammar checks and improve phrasing once content is fully revised.  
5. **Engage Critically:** Question AI suggestions, explain choices, and discuss alternatives to deepen learning and improve collaborative revisions.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES

- The student did not complete the mandatory first step—submitting a revised thesis statement—despite several prompts.  
- Revision work stalled at the hypothetical level; no concrete revision texts were pasted.  
- Please require the student to resubmit with these three key items:  
   1. Revised thesis statement (exact wording).  
   2. Revised topic sentence for body paragraph #1.  
   3. Full revised body paragraph #1 text.  
- Ask the student to indicate which AI suggestions they accepted, modified, or rejected, with reasons to demonstrate critical engagement.  
- The student is willing to engage but needs a clear mandate to produce actual drafts rather than hypothetical acceptance.

---

**Quotations from session logs:**  
- Student’s original thesis attempt: “I think governments should set stricter laws to help their rights.”  
- Student topic question: “Do you think the government should establish strict laws to protect the rights of migrant workers?”  
- Repeated avoidance: “let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on” (several timestamps).

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The essay sets a clear position on climate change and the role of individuals vs. governments, gives relevant reasons (influence on government, personal habits, consumer pressure) and examples. Ideas are generally developed but lack depth and specific evidence.
- Organization: 21/25 - Logical paragraphing with clear progression (thesis → social influence → personal actions → conclusion). Some transitions are weak, and some sentences repeat earlier points.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary is adequate but simple and repetitive (e.g., “help,” “maybe,” “not really enough”). Occasional word-choice issues reduce precision.
- Grammar: 16/25 - Frequent grammar errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., “the government maybe just listen a little,” “so nothing happen,” “it not really enough”), which sometimes interrupt flow and clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 76/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 10/25 - The revised draft is largely placeholders and fragments. It shifts topic focus to migrant workers but does not present a coherent thesis or developed arguments. Key claims are unclear or unsupported.
- Organization: 8/25 - The structure is fragmented: many “bla bla bla” placeholders, several short topic-sentence-like lines, and no coherent paragraph development or logical flow tying claims to an explicit thesis.
- Vocabulary: 10/25 - Word choice is inconsistent, with nonstandard phrasing (e.g., “migrant market will get lower and lower income”) and placeholder text. Few precise, topic-specific terms are used.
- Grammar: 8/25 - Many grammatical errors and sentence fragments (e.g., “If the government still do nothing to stop, it will become worse on social media because many people have a mind to follow the most.”). The text reads as unfinished and unedited.
- **Revised Essay Total: 36/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -40 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Attempted to refocus the essay topic (student moved to migrant-worker rights), showing willingness to change direction.
  - Included several candidate topic-sentence ideas addressing social safety, economic effects, and social media — these show the student is thinking about multiple angles.
  - The chat shows the student engaged with the scaffolded revision process (the student repeatedly acknowledged steps).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The student did not paste or confirm a revised thesis statement (required). Without a clear thesis, paragraph revisions cannot be coherently aligned.
  - Topic sentences and body paragraphs were not properly rewritten or integrated; the revised file contains placeholders and fragments rather than full, linked paragraphs.
  - No concrete evidence or examples were added to support claims; the essay remains general and unsupported.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 11** (assistant and student messages across the session)
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided clear, structured guidance (stepwise instructions, examples, and templates). The student repeatedly avoided providing the required revised thesis and often replied with “let’s pretend we have revised…” rather than pasting concrete revisions. The interaction therefore shows engagement but limited substantive exchange of revisions.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - The chat has a moderate number of turns (11) and the assistant asked multi-step, scaffolded questions (e.g., thesis checklist, topic-sentence skeletons). However, the student did not supply detailed revisions or deeper questions; the exchange remained surface-level.
  - Evidence: Assistant repeatedly requested the revised thesis and gave templates; student replied “let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on” (user messages at 2025-11-30T08:55:33.466Z and 2025-11-30T09:03:47.079Z), preventing deeper work.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - The student did not meaningfully evaluate or critique the assistant's suggestions. Instead of testing, accepting, or rejecting specific suggestions with reasons, the student avoided providing the requested revised thesis.
  - Evidence: After the assistant suggested improvements (remove “I think,” specify “migrant workers’ rights,” preview reasons), the student did not implement or discuss alternatives — wrote “let's pretend” rather than pasting an actual revision (user messages).
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - There is minimal evidence of iterative refinement. The assistant provided a clear process (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph revision), but the student did not follow through with actual edits or multiple revision rounds.
  - Evidence: The student asked to revise “body paragraph #1,” but the assistant repeatedly required the thesis confirmation first. The student did not paste any revised paragraph content for iterative feedback.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student engaged with the AI and followed the planned revision workflow in principle (acknowledged steps, selected paragraph #1 to revise).
  - Evidence: Student explicitly selected the new essay topic (“Do you think the government should establish strict laws to protect the rights of migrant workers?”) and asked to revise paragraph #1.
- The assistant provided high-quality scaffolding: clear checklists, templates for thesis and topic sentences, and stepwise instructions.
  - Evidence: Assistant messages include thesis checklist and topic-sentence skeletons (timestamps 2025-11-30T08:52:33.709Z and 2025-11-30T09:03:57.140Z).
- The student showed some awareness that the thesis needed stronger wording (the original thesis used “I think” and “their” which the assistant flagged).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- The student must produce concrete revisions (paste the revised thesis, revised topic sentence, and full paragraph) rather than hypothetically “pretending” to revise. This is essential for receiving actionable feedback and completing the assignment.
- Strengthen critical engagement with AI suggestions: accept, modify, or reject recommendations with reasons and test alternatives (e.g., paste two thesis alternatives and ask which is stronger).
- Improve sentence-level accuracy and evidence use: supply specific examples, dates, policies, or briefly-cited cases to make claims persuasive and support topic sentences.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student provided a new topic once (migrant workers' rights) but did not supply the required revised thesis statement or paragraph content for the assistant to operate on.
  - Evidence: Student wrote the topic question (2025-11-30T08:52:16.768Z) but repeatedly avoided pasting the revised thesis.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The student acknowledged the planned steps but did not follow through with concrete outputs (no confirmed thesis, no revised paragraph).
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - Little evidence that the student evaluated AI feedback; responses indicate acceptance without testing or reasoned choice.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - No completed independent edits were submitted; the revised essay file is fragmentary.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Submit the mandatory revision artifacts: paste the exact revised thesis statement, then paste the topic sentence for the chosen paragraph, then paste the full revised paragraph. The assistant can only give targeted feedback when you provide those texts.
2. Use the assistant’s templates but actively choose/modify them: produce 2–3 thesis alternatives and ask the AI to rank or refine them; justify why you prefer one to practice critical evaluation.
3. Add concrete evidence and clearer cause–effect links in body paragraphs (e.g., name a policy, a case where public pressure influenced legislation, or a statistic). Then run a short grammar pass (AI or proofreading checklist) to fix common errors.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student did not complete the required revision tasks: no confirmed revised thesis statement, no confirmed revised topic sentence, and no fully revised body paragraph were submitted. The revised essay file is fragmentary and contains placeholders.
- Please request resubmission with the three concrete items (thesis, one revised topic sentence, one full revised body paragraph). The student appears willing to engage but needs to provide actual textual revisions rather than hypothetical statements.
- Consider asking the student to follow a short rubric checklist before resubmitting: (1) paste the revised thesis, (2) paste the paragraph topic sentence, (3) paste the full paragraph, (4) indicate which AI suggestions were accepted/rejected and why.

(Quoted evidence from student: thesis attempt: “I think governments should set stricter laws to help their rights.”; student topic question: “Do you think the government should establish strict laws to protect the rights of migrant workers?”; repeated avoidance: “let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on” — see chat timestamps.)

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
bla bla bla ...  ... (revised thesis statement here
revised topic sentence | bla bla bla …However, if the migrant workers still have unfair treatment, they will be angry about the society and the government, which might let them do some illegal things outside the law. That will definitely affect the safety of our living environment.
revised topic sentence | bla bla bla …Without strict laws to maintain the price of business market and to protect the right of migrant workers, the migrant market will get lower and lower income and less workers want to come.
revised topic sentence | bla bla bla … If the government still do nothing to stop, it will become worse on social media because many people have a mind to follow the most. It will cause big risk of society and country.
However, it has many advantages if the government strict laws. revise the rest of body paragraph #1 ... 
That's all what I want to say.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:09:18.911Z

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:50:27.868Z

**You:** I changed the final draft and the topic should be: Do you think the government should establish strict laws to protect the rights of migrant workers?
is that ok for you to finish together?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:52:16.768Z

**Assistant:** Great — I can help you step by step. We’ll follow the three-step revision process. First, please confirm your current thesis statement so we can start.

I see in your final draft you wrote: “I think governments should set stricter laws to help their rights.” Is that the thesis you want to revise? If yes, paste that exact line or any other version you prefer.

Quick feedback on that version (do not revise yet — just read this and then try a new version):
- Clarity: It’s a bit unclear who “their” refers to; be specific and say “migrant workers’ rights.”
- Strength and tone: “I think” weakens the claim. Use a confident, direct stance (e.g., “The government should…”).
- Focus and preview: The thesis should briefly say why stricter laws are needed — preview 2–3 main reasons (for example: social stability, economic fairness, and protection of human rights). That helps organize the essay and signals structure to the reader.
- Language: Use precise language (“establish strict laws” or “enact stronger legal protections”) and avoid vague phrases like “help.”

Try rewriting your thesis now using this checklist:
- Directly answers the question (yes/no + position).
- Mentions “migrant workers’ rights” explicitly.
- Previews the main points you will develop (2–3 short reasons).
- Uses confident language (no “I think,” “maybe,” etc.).

Would you like to try rewriting it now? Paste your revised thesis when you’re ready. Once you’re happy with it, we’ll move to Step 2.

Step 2 (preview so you know what’s next): After we finalize the thesis, pick one body paragraph to work on — which paragraph would you like to revise? (For example: the paragraph that starts “From a social perspective…” or the one about “business market,” etc.) Then paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence. I’ll give focused feedback on how well it connects to the updated thesis and guide you to revise it.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:52:33.709Z

**You:** I think governments should set stricter laws to help their rights.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:54:04.213Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for sharing your thesis. Here’s short, clear feedback and a plan so you can revise it yourself.

Quick issues with your current thesis ("I think governments should set stricter laws to help their rights."):
- “I think” weakens the claim — use a confident stance.
- “their” is unclear. Be specific: say “migrant workers’ rights.”
- It doesn’t preview the main reasons or structure of the essay (what will you argue?).
- “set stricter laws to help” is vague — use a stronger verb (e.g., enact, implement, strengthen) and name the kinds of benefits (social stability, economic fairness, human-rights protection).

What to include when you rewrite (checklist):
- Remove “I think.” State your position directly.
- Name the group: “migrant workers’ rights.”
- Preview 2–3 main reasons you will develop (e.g., promote social stability, ensure economic fairness for workers and businesses, and protect human rights).
- Use a strong verb (enact/implement/strengthen/guarantee) and concise language.

Structure guide (not a full sentence — use this to build your own thesis):
- [Governments should + strong verb + legal protections for migrant workers] + because/by + [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Paste your new version when you’re ready. Once you’re happy with it, we’ll move to Step 2 and pick a paragraph to revise.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:54:12.802Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement  and move on 
bla bla bla ...

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:55:33.466Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — glad you want to move on. Before we begin Step 2, I do need one quick confirmation from you (this is part of the process):

1) Please paste the revised thesis statement you said we’ve already made, or simply type “Thesis confirmed” plus a one-line summary of the position (for example: “Thesis confirmed — Governments should enact stronger legal protections for migrant workers to promote social stability, economic fairness, and human-rights protection”). I can’t continue until I know exactly what the thesis now says, because the topic sentence must link to it.

Once you confirm the thesis, Step 2:
2) Choose one body paragraph to work on. Which would you like to revise?
- Paragraph A: “From a social perspective, …” (social stability / safety)
- Paragraph B: “For business market, …” (economic effects / efficiency)
- Paragraph C: “From the perspectives of people and social media, …” (public opinion / online reaction)
- Paragraph D: “However, it has many advantages if the government strict laws.” (advantages / government action)

3) Paste the current topic sentence of the paragraph you pick. If you prefer, you can just name the paragraph and paste its first sentence.

Helpful checklist for the topic sentence (use this to guide your revision):
- Does it state a clear claim that supports your thesis?
- Does it preview the paragraph’s main point or reason?
- Is the connection to the thesis explicit (mention social stability, economic fairness, or rights)?
- Is the language confident and specific (avoid “maybe” or weak verbs)?

If you’d like a quick template to help rewrite the topic sentence (not a full sentence — just a structure), use one of these skeletons depending on the paragraph:
- Social paragraph skeleton: [From a social perspective,] + [stricter laws are necessary because + effect on social stability & safety].
- Business paragraph skeleton: [In the business/economic sphere,] + [stronger legal protections help ensure + economic fairness/productivity].
- Media/public paragraph skeleton: [Regarding public opinion and media,] + [government action prevents + social unrest and misinformation].
- Advantages paragraph skeleton: [Stronger government regulation] + [brings benefits such as + (list one or two effects)].

Would you like to paste your confirmed thesis now and pick a paragraph and topic sentence to revise?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:55:44.355Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on 
bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:03:47.079Z

**Assistant:** Okay — we can continue, but I still need one required thing before we move on: the revised thesis (Step 1 is mandatory). Please either:

- Paste the exact revised thesis statement you want to use, OR  
- Type “Thesis confirmed —” followed by a one-line summary of the position (for example: Thesis confirmed — Governments should enact stronger legal protections for migrant workers to promote social stability, economic fairness, and human‑rights protection).

Quick reminder of what the thesis must do (short checklist):
- Take a clear, confident position (no “I think”).  
- Name the group (migrant workers’ rights).  
- Preview 2–3 main reasons/points that your essay will develop.

Once you paste or confirm the thesis, pick one body paragraph to work on (choose A, B, C, or D from your draft) and paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence. If you prefer, just name the paragraph and paste its first sentence.

Helpful short checklist for revising the topic sentence (so it links to your new thesis):
- Does it state a clear claim that supports the thesis?  
- Does it preview the paragraph’s main point (one reason from the thesis)?  
- Is the language specific and confident?  
- Does it prepare the reader for the evidence/examples that follow?

If you want a safe structure to follow (not a full sentence), choose one of these skeletons and fill it in after you confirm the thesis:
- Social paragraph: [From a social perspective,] + [stronger laws are necessary because … (effect on social stability/safety).]
- Business paragraph: [In the economic/business sphere,] + [legal protections help ensure … (fair wages/market stability).]
- Media/public paragraph: [Regarding public opinion and social media,] + [government action prevents … (unrest/misinformation).]
- Advantages paragraph: [Stronger government regulation] + [brings benefits such as … (list 1–2 effects).]

Would you like to paste the confirmed thesis now and choose which paragraph (A–D) to revise? Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence now?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:03:57.140Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1 
bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:05:13.493Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I can help, but first I must follow Step 1 (thesis revision). Step 1 is mandatory before we revise paragraph 1.

Quick reminder: your original thesis (“I think governments should set stricter laws to help their rights.”) needs three changes:
- Remove “I think” and use a confident stance.
- Specify who “their” refers to (migrant workers’ rights).
- Preview 2–3 main reasons (so the essay is organised).

Please either:
- Paste your revised thesis exactly, OR
- Type “Thesis confirmed —” plus a one-line summary of the position (for example: Thesis confirmed — Governments should enact stronger legal protections for migrant workers to promote social stability, economic fairness, and human-rights protection).

Here is a short skeleton to help you build the thesis (not a full sentence — fill in your wording):
[Governments should + strong verb (enact/implement/strengthen) + legal protections for migrant workers] + because + [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].

Once you paste or confirm the thesis, we’ll move to Step 2. You already chose body paragraph #1 — great. After you confirm the thesis, please also paste paragraph #1’s current topic sentence (the first line of that paragraph). I’ll give focused feedback on how well it connects to the thesis and guide you to revise it.

A few quick reminders about revising the paragraph after the topic sentence is fixed:
- Check that each supporting sentence clearly relates to the new topic sentence.
- Ask: Do my examples and explanations show how stricter laws produce the effects I named in the thesis (e.g., social stability, safety)?
- Look for unclear language, grammar issues, and places that need evidence or clearer cause–effect links.
