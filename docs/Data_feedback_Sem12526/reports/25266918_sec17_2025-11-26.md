            ## Contribution Analysis

            It looks like you have made great progress on revising your essay with a clear balanced thesis, improved positive paragraph, and a more nuanced conclusion. Here is a summary of your current position and some tailored recommendations:

---

### Current Conclusion (final version):

> In conclusion, while the future is uncertain, automation may improve long-term prospects if governments and businesses provide retraining programs and regulate its use responsibly.

This conclusion is clear, balanced, and appropriately hedged, which fits well with the balanced thesis you preferred in your introduction.

---

### Recommendations to Optimize Your Conclusion Further

If you want to make the conclusion slightly stronger without losing hedging or clarity, consider:

- **Briefly restate the key points** you balanced in the thesis (about benefits and risks).
- **Emphasize the need for action** more explicitly to reinforce your recommendation.

Example enhanced conclusion options:

**Option 1 (summary + hedged stance + recommendation):**  
*In conclusion, while automation offers clear benefits such as increased efficiency and safer working conditions, it also presents challenges like job losses and over-reliance on machines. While the future is uncertain, automation may improve long-term prospects if governments and businesses provide retraining programs and regulate its use responsibly.*

**Option 2 (more concise, linking to thesis):**  
*In conclusion, automation brings both advantages and risks. Although the future remains uncertain, its long-term benefits can be realized if appropriate training and regulation are implemented.*

---

### Tips for Polishing Your Conclusion

- Avoid “from my perspective” — it weakens academic tone. Speak confidently but fairly.
- Use “automation” (without "the") unless you specify a type (e.g., “the automation of factories”).
- Avoid vague phrases like “make full use of it correctly.” Specify who should act (governments, businesses) and what actions they should take.
- Link back to your essay’s main arguments to reinforce unity.

---

### Next Steps for Your Essay

Since you’ve done the thesis, positive paragraph, and conclusion revisions, here are some recommendations for continuing:

1. **Revise the Negative Paragraph:**  
   Focus on creating a clear topic sentence and better-developed supporting sentences that directly link to your thesis points (job losses and over-reliance). I can help with a detailed, sentence-by-sentence annotated edit if you want.

2. **Grammar and Style Pass:**  
   Fix articles, collocations, punctuation, and sentence structure errors throughout the essay to polish clarity and fluency.

3. **Practice Independent Revisions:**  
   Try writing some revised sentences yourself based on feedback (e.g., for the negative paragraph), then share them here for focused feedback.

---

If you'd like, I can now:

- Provide a model revised negative paragraph with annotations,  
- Give you a checklist/tips to self-edit your negative paragraph step-by-step,  
- Or offer some micro-tasks for grammar and vocabulary corrections.

Just let me know what you prefer!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The essay addresses a clear, relevant prompt (automation’s pros and cons) and presents basic reasons (efficiency, safety vs. job loss, dependence). Development is uneven and some claims are vague (e.g., “terrible and horrible to the development of humanity”), reducing depth.
- Organization: 18/25 - The structure is the simple pros/cons pattern (intro, positive paragraph, negative paragraph, conclusion). Paragraph focus and transitions are present but weak; some sentences do not follow logically and the introduction and conclusion are vague.
- Vocabulary: 16/25 - Word choice is basic and contains inaccurate forms and collocations (e.g., “the automation,” “a trending,” “researching a fallen house”). Some attempt at varied vocabulary but frequent errors.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 15/25 - Multiple grammatical and punctuation errors (spelling mistakes, article misuse, awkward phrasing) that sometimes impede clarity (e.g., “ehhance gobal employment,” “fall to acquire money”).
- **Original Essay Total: 67/100**

Evidence (original): “Some individuals hold the firm view that the automation ultimately ehhance gobal employment, some insist on the opposite opinions.” / “Without automation, a building task needs to be done by fifty workers for one year; however, under the condition of automation, it can be finished just in seventy days.”

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The revision adds a clearer balanced thesis and improves the positive paragraph with a clearer example (construction timing) and a safer-work example. The negative paragraph remains underdeveloped and repetitive, limiting overall gains.
- Organization: 19/25 - The essay keeps the pros/cons structure but the linkage between paragraphs and the thesis improves (thesis now previews both sides). Flow still weak in the negative paragraph, and conclusion could better restate the essay’s main points before recommending action.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Some vocabulary and phrasing are improved (e.g., “inspect collapsed buildings,” “retraining programs”), but inconsistent accuracy remains and some awkward phrases persist in the negative paragraph.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 17/25 - Noticeable improvements in several places (positive paragraph, conclusion), including corrected punctuation and better sentence structure. However, the negative paragraph still contains grammatical errors and awkward sentences that reduce clarity.
- **Revised Essay Total: 74/100**

Evidence (revised): Balanced thesis: “Automation offers significant benefits—improving efficiency and reducing dangerous work—but it also raises serious concerns, such as job losses and excessive reliance on machines.” Positive paragraph revision: “...could be completed in about seventy days with automation, demonstrating faster completion and lower labor demands.” Conclusion hedging: “In conclusion, while the future is uncertain, automation may improve long-term prospects if governments and businesses provide retraining programs and regulate its use responsibly.”

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +7 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clear balanced thesis added that previews pros and cons and links to body paragraphs.
  - Positive body paragraph revised: supporting sentences clarified (construction example tightened; safety example reworded to “inspecting collapsed buildings”).
  - Conclusion rewritten to be more specific and hedged; recommendation added (retraining + regulation).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Negative paragraph remains weak: grammar, clarity, and development need substantial revision. Sentences still include awkward phrasing and repetition (e.g., “terrible and horrible to the development of humanity and human society”).
  - Cohesion and transitions could be stronger (explicit linking sentences between paragraphs and clearer topic sentences).
  - More precise evidence and deeper analysis (e.g., concrete data, clearer cause–effect explanation) would strengthen arguments.

---

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 36**
- **Conversation Quality:** Highly iterative and task-focused. The assistant set a clear revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) and the student engaged actively, often choosing options and requesting particular changes. Interaction included negotiation of goals, multiple drafts, and final acceptance.

Representative evidence:
- Student rejected an early AI stance suggestion: “I don not think it is a good idea to give the clear stance before I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of automation.”
- Student explicitly chose to keep the original topic sentence: “I select A and keep my original sentence.”
- Student requested hedging in the conclusion: “Maybe this sentence is too absolute，after all，we never know what will happen in the futuer.”

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - The chat contains 36 back-and-forth messages with multi-step planning, iterative edits, and sustained engagement. The student and AI discussed strategy, multiple draft options, and stylistic choices in depth.
  - Evidence: Long sequence of strategy-setting messages (assistant’s initial planning message) and stepwise revisions across thesis, paragraph, and conclusion.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - The student consistently evaluated AI input and made choices (rejected an early clear stance, asked for a balanced thesis, insisted on keeping original topic sentence). There is good evidence of selective acceptance and modification of AI suggestions, though in several cases the student accepted AI edits without fully rewriting those parts themselves.
  - Evidence: Student: “I don not think it is a good idea to give the clear stance…”; later: “I select A and keep my original sentence.”
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - Multiple meaningful revision cycles occurred: (1) thesis discussion and acceptance of a balanced thesis, (2) positive paragraph revision, (3) iterative refinement of the conclusion, and (4) continuing plan to revise the negative paragraph. These cycles show active refinement.
  - Evidence: The assistant applied changes and the student accepted final hedged conclusion; earlier rounds show multiple alternative phrasings offered and discussed.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear engagement and ownership: The student actively chose revision goals and repeatedly guided the assistant (e.g., preference for a balanced thesis and final stance in the conclusion).
- Effective use of AI scaffolding: Student followed a structured revision process (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph → conclusion) and used assistant suggestions to improve clarity and specificity.
- Improved clarity in key places: The balanced thesis and the revised positive paragraph and conclusion show measurable gains in logic and specificity.

Evidence: Student’s message “OK. The statement is fine.” followed by acceptance of revised paragraph and hedged conclusion; revised essay shows clearer examples (“completed in about seventy days,” “inspecting collapsed buildings,” “retraining programs and regulate its use responsibly”).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Independent rewriting and editing: The student often asked the assistant to perform revisions rather than producing revised sentences themselves (e.g., “Can you help me revise the rest of the essay…”; “I select A and keep my original sentence.”). Practice composing revisions independently will build editing skills.
- Negative paragraph content and grammar: This paragraph retains many errors, repetition, and vague assertions; it needs focused reworking (clear topic sentence, concise supporting sentences, corrected grammar).
- Sentence-level accuracy and vocabulary precision: Continued attention to articles, verb forms, collocations, and punctuation across the essay is required.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the original essay and clearly stated preferences (topic = automation; preference for balanced thesis). Evidence: “This is an essay that discuss the automation. I don not think it is a good idea to give the clear stance...”
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student followed a stepwise plan set by the AI and made choices about scope (focusing on thesis, then paragraph, then conclusion).
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good - The student questioned AI recommendations (insisted on balanced thesis and hedging); showed selective adoption of suggestions.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The student relied on the AI for actual sentence- and paragraph-level rewrites rather than producing many independent rewrites during the chat.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise the negative paragraph fully: write a focused topic sentence (pick one main harm), produce 2–3 concise supporting sentences with clear cause–effect links, and end with a short linking sentence to the thesis. Then perform a self-edit pass to correct grammar and word choice.
2. Do a focused sentence-level editing pass over the whole essay: fix article use, verb forms, punctuation/spacing, and common collocation errors (e.g., “automation” not “the automation”; “a trend” not “a trending”).
3. Practice active revision: when using AI, try drafting one or two candidate sentences yourself before asking for alternatives. This builds independent editing skills and allows more critical evaluation of AI output.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- Task completion check: The student revised the thesis (accepted a balanced thesis) and had the positive body paragraph revised (assistant applied edits to supporting sentences), but the student explicitly chose to keep the original topic sentence rather than revising it themselves. Per the initial checklist, one required item (revising a topic sentence) was not completed by the student—hence the “not finished” status at the top.
- The student demonstrates strong collaborative behavior and good judgment about argumentative structure (preference for balanced thesis and final stance in conclusion). They would benefit most from exercises that require producing and defending their own sentence-level revisions to build independent editing skills.
- Recommended next task for class: require the student to submit a revised negative paragraph written by themselves (one draft only), followed by a short reflection (2–3 sentences) explaining which AI suggestions they accepted and which they rejected, and why. This will give evidence of independent editing and critical evaluation.

If you would like, I can produce a sentence-by-sentence annotated edit of the negative paragraph (showing required fixes) and a short checklist the student can use to self-edit that paragraph.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
In this day and age, topics about the automation have aroused a lot ot attention. Some individuals hold the firm view that the automation ultimately ehhance gobal employment, some insist on the opposite opinions. Now, I will discuss the automation from two sides before I acquired the final idea.
                                                                                                                                                                                There is no denying that the automation has many positive impacts. For one thing, it is beneficial to the improvement of efficiency. Take the term of work for instance. Without automation, a building task needs to be done by fifty workers for one year; however, under the condition of automation, it can be finished just in seventy days. For another thing, the automation enables people to keep away from dangerous works.That is to say, people can do some unsafe tasks by operating instead of doing by themselves, such as researching a fallen house.                                                                                                                                         It is widely accepted that there are many negative points of automaton as well. Firstly, some jobs are replaced by automation. Thus, people lose their jobs, which leads to a fact that many people fall to acquire money to support their families. At the same time, when many industries employing automation, people are willing to depend on machines instead of themselves, which is terrible and horrible to the development of humanity and human society. To put it another way, automation causes that people and children refuse to think and finish tasks by themselves.Many machines are operating day by day , but humans stop to walk forward, leading to a negative prospects.
In conclusion, from my perspective , the automation employed in many industries is a trending that nobody can change. It can ultimately enhance prospects in the long term as long as we make full use of it correctly.

Revised:
In this day and age, topics about the automation have aroused a lot of attention.Automation offers significant benefits , but it also raises serious concerns Now, I will discuss the automation from two sides before I acquired the final idea.
                                                                                                                                                                                There is no denying that automation has many positive impacts. For one thing, it is beneficial to the improvement of efficiency. Take the term of work for instance. Without automation, a building task needs to be done by fifty workers for one year; however, under the condition of automation, it can be finished just in seventy days.This example shows how automation speeds up work and reduces labor needs. For another thing, the automation enables people to keep away from dangerous works.That is to say, machines can perform hazardous tasks, such as inspecting collapsed buildings. 
                                                                                                                                       It is widely accepted that there are many negative points of automaton as well. Firstly, automation also causes job losses , which can lead to economic hardship and fewer opportunities for workers.Due to people losing their jobs,  many people fall to acquire money to support their families. At the same time, as industries depend more on machines, workers may stop practicing certain skills, which can reduce human problem‑solving ability and make economies more vulnerable if technology fails.To put it another way, automation causes that people and children refuse to think and finish tasks by themselves , which may result in a fact that people lose practical abilities and decrease innovation.Many machines are operating day by day , but humans stop to walk forward, leading to a negative prospects.

In conclusion, from my perspective , automation employed in many industries is an unstoppable trend that nobody can change. While the future is uncertain, automation may improve long-term prospects if governments and businesses provide retraining programs and regulate its use responsibly.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:48:18.654Z

**You:** Revise thesis statement Some individuals hold the firm view that the automation ultimately ehhance gobal employment, some insist on the opposite opinions.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:50:36.167Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I’m ready to help. Before I edit the thesis, two quick steps so we work toward the improvements you want.

1) Quick question about your goals
- Which of these are your priorities for this session? (Pick one or two.)
  - Clarity and strength of the thesis/argument
  - Organization and logical flow
  - Evidence and development in paragraphs
  - Grammar, vocabulary, and sentence accuracy

2) Short diagnostic (3–4 lines)
- Thesis & Argument: The current thesis is unclear and hedged; it doesn’t clearly state a position or preview the main points.
- Organization: The essay has a basic two-sided structure (advantages/disadvantages), but transitions and focus need work.
- Evidence & Development: You have concrete examples, but some need clearer explanation and connection to the thesis.
- Language Use: Many spelling, grammar, and word-choice errors reduce clarity and formality.

3) Decision needed
- Do you want to focus only on the thesis now (as you requested), or do you also want me to prioritize language accuracy along with the thesis? Also — quick clarification: the essay draft discusses automation, while the course prompt you pasted is about climate change. Did you mean to write about automation? 

Once you confirm (which targets and whether the topic is automation), I’ll move to Step 1 and help you revise the thesis.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:50:55.787Z

**You:** focus only on the thesis now

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:52:29.386Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. I’ll focus only on the thesis for this turn.

Quick check before we start:
- Your draft discusses automation (not climate change). Is that the topic you want to keep?  

Now: your current thesis sentence appears to be this line in the introduction:
"Now, I will discuss the automation from two sides before I acquired the final idea."
This isn’t a clear thesis yet because it doesn’t state your position or preview the main reasons.

What a strong revised thesis should do
- Take a clear position (positive, negative, or mixed) on automation’s overall impact.
- Preview the main points you will use to support that position (2–3 reasons).
- Use confident, precise language (no hedging: avoid “I think,” “maybe,” “I will discuss”).

Try this now
- Please write one sentence that states your position and previews 2 main reasons. Use one of these stems to help if you like (fill in the bracketed parts):
  - "Automation is [overall positive/negative/mixed] because it [reason 1] and [reason 2]."
  - "Although automation [acknowledges a downside], it is [overall positive/negative] because [reason 1] and [reason 2]."

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? If you prefer, say “Please suggest a model thesis” and I’ll offer one for you to edit.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:52:48.733Z

**You:** Please suggest a model thesis

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:54:08.501Z

**Assistant:** Great—here’s a clear model thesis you can use. It takes a confident position and previews two main reasons you later discuss:

Model thesis:
Despite its potential to eliminate some jobs, automation is ultimately beneficial because it increases efficiency and allows people to avoid dangerous work.

I’ve inserted that thesis into your draft below (only the final sentence of the introduction is changed). Read it and tell me if you’re happy with this version or would like a different emphasis (e.g., mixed view, stronger on economic concerns, or highlighting retraining/education).

Full revised essay with the new thesis:
---
In this day and age, topics about the automation have aroused a lot ot attention. Some individuals hold the firm view that the automation ultimately ehhance gobal employment, some insist on the opposite opinions. Despite its potential to eliminate some jobs, automation is ultimately beneficial because it increases efficiency and allows people to avoid dangerous work.

There is no denying that the automation has many positive impacts. For one thing, it is beneficial to the improvement of efficiency. Take the term of work for instance. Without automation, a building task needs to be done by fifty workers for one year; however, under the condition of automation, it can be finished just in seventy days. For another thing, the automation enables people to keep away from dangerous works.That is to say, people can do some unsafe tasks by operating instead of doing by themselves, such as researching a fallen house.

It is widely accepted that there are many negative points of automaton as well. Firstly, some jobs are replaced by automation. Thus, people lose their jobs, which leads to a fact that many people fall to acquire money to support their families. At the same time, when many industries employing automation, people are willing to depend on machines instead of themselves, which is terrible and horrible to the development of humanity and human society. To put it another way, automation causes that people and children refuse to think and finish tasks by themselves.Many machines are operating day by day , but humans stop to walk forward, leading to a negative prospects.

In conclusion, from my perspective , the automation employed in many industries is a trending that nobody can change. It can ultimately enhance prospects in the long term as long as we make full use of it correctly.

Would you like to keep this thesis, or try a different wording? If you’re happy with it, pick one body paragraph to work on next (for example, the paragraph that starts “There is no denying…” or the paragraph that starts “It is widely accepted…”). Which one would you like to revise for Step 2?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:54:22.840Z

**You:** This is an essay that discuss the automation. I don not think it is a good idea to give the clear stance before I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of automation

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:57:24.718Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — that’s a helpful preference. Before we revise the thesis, two quick steps so we’re clear on goals and next moves.

1) Pick your priorities (choose one or two)
- Clarity and strength of the thesis/argument
- Organization and logical flow
- Evidence and development in paragraphs
- Grammar, vocabulary, and sentence accuracy

Which one or two should we focus on today?

2) Short diagnostic (3–4 lines)
- Thesis & Argument: Right now the introduction signals you’ll discuss both sides but doesn’t state a clear position; for “to what extent” prompts, examiners usually expect a clear stance.
- Organization: Your essay already follows an advantages/disadvantages structure, which can work well if the introduction previews the points clearly.
- Evidence & Development: You have useful examples (construction time, dangerous work) but they need clearer links to the thesis.
- Language Use: Spelling, word choice, and grammar errors reduce clarity—these are important but we can leave detailed editing for later if you prefer.

3) Quick decision about the thesis approach
You said you don’t want to give a clear stance before discussing both sides. That’s fine — but two important notes:
- For graded tasks (e.g., IELTS-type “to what extent” prompts) a clear overall position in the thesis is usually stronger.
- If you still prefer not to state a final stance in the thesis, we can write a “balanced preview” thesis that (a) signals you will discuss both advantages and disadvantages and (b) previews the two or three main points you’ll cover — without committing to a final judgment until the conclusion. This is less persuasive than a clear stance, but it respects your preference.

Which of these do you want?
A — Write a clear, overall stance in the thesis (recommended for stronger essays)
B — Write a balanced preview that does not state the final stance (your preference)

4) Next step (choose one)
- If you want to try: Please write one sentence for the thesis (either a clear stance or a balanced preview, depending on your choice). I’ll give feedback and help you revise it.
- If you want me to suggest a model thesis first, say “Please suggest a model thesis” and tell me whether you want A or B.

Would you like to try drafting the thesis now, or should I offer a model to edit?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:57:46.617Z

**You:** How about give clear idea in the last paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:59:20.351Z

**Assistant:** That plan is fine — we can write a balanced thesis in the introduction and give your clear position in the conclusion. Before I change anything, quick confirmation:

- You want a balanced preview thesis (no final stance yet) that previews the main pros and cons, and then state your clear position in the final paragraph later. Is that correct?

If yes, here’s a suggested balanced thesis you can accept or edit. Try to make it one confident sentence that previews 2–3 main points.

Model balanced thesis:
Automation offers significant benefits—improving efficiency and reducing dangerous work—but it also raises serious concerns, such as job losses and excessive reliance on machines.

If you’re happy with that thesis, I’ll insert it into your essay (only the final sentence of the introduction will change) and show the full revised text. After that, pick which body paragraph you want to work on next:
- Paragraph 1 (the one listing positive impacts), or
- Paragraph 2 (the one listing negative impacts).

Which do you want to revise for Step 2?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T12:59:35.113Z

**You:** OK. The statement is fine . How

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:01:37.664Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming the balanced thesis.

Step 2: choose a paragraph to work on
Which paragraph would you like to revise next?
- Paragraph 1 (positive impacts — starts “There is no denying that the automation has many positive impacts.”), or
- Paragraph 2 (negative impacts — starts “It is widely accepted that there are many negative points of automaton as well.”)

Once you pick, please paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence (or the whole paragraph if you prefer). I’ll give quick feedback on how well the topic sentence connects to the balanced thesis and then prompt you to try a revised topic sentence.

Quick checklist I’ll use to give feedback
- Does the topic sentence state one clear main idea for the paragraph?
- Does it link logically to the thesis (benefit or concern listed there)?
- Does it preview what the paragraph will explain or provide evidence for?

If you want a little help for rewriting, here are two short stems you can use—fill in the bracketed part rather than copying them exactly:
- For a positive paragraph: “One important benefit of automation is that it [clearly state the benefit, e.g., improves efficiency or reduces risk in dangerous jobs].”
- For a negative paragraph: “However, automation also [clearly state the harm, e.g., causes job loss or increases dependence on machines], which can lead to [brief consequence].”

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now? Paste your topic sentence and your version of a revised sentence when you’re ready — I’ll give focused feedback and suggestions.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:01:57.500Z

**You:** Paragraph and revise topic senteces

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:04:03.600Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — quick check: do you want to work on the positive paragraph (starts “There is no denying that the automation has many positive impacts.”) or the negative paragraph (starts “It is widely accepted that there are many negative points of automaton as well.”)?

When you tell me which one, paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence (or the whole paragraph if you prefer). Then try a revised topic sentence using one of these short stems (fill in the bracketed parts):

- Positive paragraph stem: One important benefit of automation is that it [state the clear benefit, e.g., increases efficiency or reduces risk in dangerous jobs].
- Negative paragraph stem: However, automation also [state the clear harm, e.g., causes job losses or creates over-reliance on machines], which can lead to [brief consequence].

I’ll give quick feedback on whether it:
- States one clear main idea,
- Links to the balanced thesis, and
- Previews what the paragraph will explain.

Would you like to paste the topic sentence now and try a revision?

**You:** How about use one sentences to sum the advantages . And

**Assistant:** Great — that’s a clear next step. Just to confirm: we’re focusing on the positive paragraph (the one about benefits), and you want one clear topic sentence that sums the advantages and links to your balanced thesis (efficiency and safer work). Correct?

Quick checklist for that sentence
- States one clear main idea (one advantage).
- Links to the thesis (efficiency or safety).
- Previews the paragraph’s evidence (e.g., faster construction, fewer workers; avoidance of dangerous tasks).
- Uses confident, simple language.

Two short stems you can use — fill in the bracketed parts (don’t copy them word-for-word; make them your own):
- One important benefit of automation is that it [increases efficiency / completes tasks faster], which allows [fewer workers to do more / projects to finish sooner].
- Another key advantage is that automation [reduces exposure to dangerous work / keeps people out of risky situations], for example when [machines replace humans in hazardous tasks].

Would you like to try writing one sentence now using one of those stems? Paste your sentence and I’ll give focused feedback and a small suggestion to improve it. If you prefer, I can give a short hint instead of a full sentence — which do you want?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:09:02.259Z

**You:** For one thing, it is beneficial to the improvement of efficiency. Take the term of work for instance. Without automation, a building task needs to be done by fifty workers for one year; however, under the condition of automation, it can be finished just in seventy days. For another thing, the automation enables people to keep away from dangerous works.That is to say, people can do some unsafe tasks by operating instead of doing by themselves, such as researching a fallen house.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:10:25.015Z

**Assistant:** Nice choice—working on the positive paragraph will make your essay clearer. Quick feedback first:

- Your current topic sentence ("There is no denying that the automation has many positive impacts.") is too general and has small grammar issues. It doesn’t tell the reader which one clear benefit the paragraph will focus on.
- Link it directly to your thesis by naming one main benefit (efficiency or safety) and previewing the evidence you’ll use (faster construction times, fewer workers, fewer risky jobs).

Try one of these stems (fill in the bracketed parts in your own words):
- One important benefit of automation is that it [increases efficiency / completes tasks faster], which [allows projects to finish sooner / means fewer workers are needed].
- Another key advantage is that automation [reduces people’s exposure to dangerous work], for example when [machines replace humans in hazardous tasks].

Would you like to try writing one revised topic sentence now? If you prefer a quick model to adapt, here’s a short example you can edit:
- One important benefit of automation is that it increases efficiency, allowing tasks—such as building projects—to be completed much faster and with fewer workers.

Try your version (one sentence) and I’ll give focused feedback and then help revise the paragraph’s supporting sentences. Which stem did you choose: efficiency or safety?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:10:47.016Z

**You:** Can you give me an example of the topic sentence of the paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:13:20.732Z

**Assistant:** Good question — I can show examples. First: would you like to try writing one yourself first? If not, here are three short model topic sentences you can adapt (each links to your balanced thesis). Pick one and edit it in your own words, then I’ll give feedback.

Model topic sentences
- Efficiency-focused: One important benefit of automation is that it increases efficiency, allowing large construction projects to be completed much faster and with fewer workers.
- Safety-focused: Another key advantage of automation is that it reduces people’s exposure to dangerous work, for example when machines inspect unstable buildings instead of sending people inside.
- Combined (use only if you plan to cover both points in the same paragraph): Automation improves efficiency and reduces exposure to dangerous work, which together boost productivity and protect workers.

Quick tips
- Use “automation” (not “the automation”).
- Keep the topic sentence focused on one clear main idea that matches your thesis.
- Preview the evidence you will use (e.g., faster build times; machines in hazardous tasks).

Which one would you like to use or adapt? If you prefer, paste your attempt and I’ll give focused feedback.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:13:40.849Z

**You:** I think my original version is better because I write a clear sentence to express it has advantages at the beginning. So let us revise the paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:17:12.547Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for that. I’m glad you want to revise the positive paragraph. Quick confirmation: we’ll work on the paragraph that begins “There is no denying that the automation has many positive impacts.” I’ll help you improve the topic sentence and then strengthen the supporting sentences — but I’ll follow your lead: you can choose a topic sentence option and either revise the supporting sentences yourself or ask me to make suggested edits for you.

First — two short topic-sentence options. Pick one (A or B), or edit them in your own words and paste your version:

A — Minimal fix (keeps your original idea, fixes grammar):
There is no denying that automation has many positive impacts.

B — Stronger, clearer (links to the thesis and previews the evidence):
Automation improves efficiency and reduces exposure to dangerous work, which increases productivity and protects workers.

Quick feedback on these options
- A keeps your original voice but is still general. You’ll need to make sure the paragraph’s supporting sentences clearly show which benefits you mean (efficiency and safety).
- B is stronger: it names the two main benefits and previews the examples you already have (faster construction times and avoiding hazardous tasks). That helps the paragraph connect directly to the thesis.

Now three focused suggestions for the supporting sentences (small, practical edits you can make)
1) Clarify the construction example and link it to “efficiency.”  
   - Say what the numbers mean and connect them to the topic sentence (e.g., “This example shows how automation speeds up work and reduces labor needs.”)

2) Fix and clarify the safety example.  
   - Replace phrases like “researching a fallen house” with “inspecting collapsed buildings” or “examining unsafe structures” and show how machines reduce risk for people.

3) Clean grammar and word choice (short list of fixes):
   - Use “automation” (no “the” before it).
   - Change “ehhance gobal employment” → “enhance global employment” (but consider whether you mean “create jobs” or “improve employment prospects”).
   - Change “many negative points of automaton” → “many negative aspects of automation.”
   - Fix spacing and punctuation (e.g., space after periods).

Next step — what would you like to do now?
- Option 1: Choose A or B (or paste your own revised topic sentence). Then try revising one or two supporting sentences yourself and paste them here. I’ll give quick feedback and one focused suggestion for each sentence.
- Option 2: Ask me to apply the changes now. If you want me to revise the paragraph for you, I will make the edits and include the full updated essay in my next reply.

Which do you prefer?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:17:54.131Z

**You:** I select A and keep my original sentence. Can you help me revise the rest of the essay, such as grammar and structure

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:27:04.695Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — and thanks for choosing option A. Quick reminder: you asked me to revise the rest of the essay, but our agreed scope lets me revise only the thesis and the one paragraph you chose (the positive paragraph). I’ve done that now: I kept your chosen topic sentence (A) and edited the supporting sentences in that paragraph for clarity, unity, and grammar. I also replaced the introductory final sentence with the balanced thesis we agreed on.

Here is the full essay with those changes included:

---
In this day and age, topics about the automation have aroused a lot of attention. Automation offers significant benefits—improving efficiency and reducing dangerous work—but it also raises serious concerns, such as job losses and excessive reliance on machines.

There is no denying that automation has many positive impacts. For one thing, it improves efficiency: a construction task that might require fifty workers working for a year could be completed in about seventy days with automation, demonstrating faster completion and lower labor demands. For another, automation reduces exposure to dangerous work; machines can perform hazardous tasks such as inspecting collapsed buildings, which helps keep people out of harm's way.

It is widely accepted that there are many negative points of automaton as well. Firstly, some jobs are replaced by automation. Thus, people lose their jobs, which leads to a fact that many people fall to acquire money to support their families. At the same time, when many industries employing automation, people are willing to depend on machines instead of themselves, which is terrible and horrible to the development of humanity and human society. To put it another way, automation causes that people and children refuse to think and finish tasks by themselves.Many machines are operating day by day , but humans stop to walk forward, leading to a negative prospects.

In conclusion, from my perspective , the automation employed in many industries is a trending that nobody can change. It can ultimately enhance prospects in the long term as long as we make full use of it correctly.

Would you like to continue? Here are two clear next steps — pick one:
- Option 1 (recommended): Revise the negative paragraph next (topic sentence + supporting sentences), following the same step-by-step process.
- Option 2: Expand scope so I can do a full grammar and structure pass on the whole essay (I’ll need your confirmation to work beyond the original scope).

If you choose Option 1, say “Revise negative paragraph” and paste the topic sentence you prefer (or ask me to suggest one). If you choose Option 2, say “Full edit please” and I’ll explain how I’ll proceed and which parts I’ll change.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:27:40.981Z

**You:** option 1

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:31:24.153Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing Option 1 (revise the negative paragraph). We’ll follow the three-step process: confirm the thesis (Step 1), revise the topic sentence for the negative paragraph (Step 2), then work on that paragraph’s supporting sentences (Step 3). I’ll guide and prompt you; please try short revisions and I’ll give targeted feedback.

Step 1 — Quick check of the thesis
- Current balanced thesis we agreed on: "Automation offers significant benefits—improving efficiency and reducing dangerous work—but it also raises serious concerns, such as job losses and excessive reliance on machines."
- Quick feedback: This thesis is clear, balanced, and previews the two sides you discuss. It links well to the positive and negative paragraphs. Are you happy to keep this as the thesis? (Yes / No — if no, say whether you want a clearer stance instead.)

Step 2 — Topic sentence for the negative paragraph
- Which paragraph we’re revising: the negative one (currently begins "It is widely accepted that there are many negative points of automaton as well.")
- Quick diagnosis of that topic sentence: it’s vague, has grammar issues, and doesn’t preview a single focused idea for the paragraph.

Try this now: please write one revised topic sentence (one sentence only) that clearly states one main negative idea and previews a consequence or example. Use one of these stems (fill in the bracketed parts in your own words):

- Negative harm stem 1: "However, automation also [causes job losses / displaces workers], which can lead to [economic hardship / fewer opportunities for workers]."
- Negative harm stem 2: "Another problem with automation is that it [creates over‑reliance on machines / reduces human skills], which may result in [people losing practical abilities / decreased innovation]."

Checklist I’ll use to give feedback:
- Does the sentence state one clear main idea?
- Does it link to the thesis (job losses or reliance on machines)?
- Does it preview the evidence or consequence you will explain in the paragraph?

Would you like to try writing the revised topic sentence now? Paste your one-sentence attempt and I’ll give focused feedback and one small suggestion. If you prefer, tell me which stem you want to use first (job losses or over‑reliance).

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:31:41.211Z

**You:** I think the two stems can repress my sub-point.Can you help me optimize the last paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:36:39.265Z

**Assistant:** Good point — let’s make that last paragraph clearer so your sub-point (job losses, dependence, or something else) isn’t squeezed out.

Quick question before I edit: which sub-point do you most want to emphasize in the negative paragraph?
- A: Job losses and economic hardship
- B: Over‑reliance on machines and loss of human skills
- C: Both (briefly, but with one as the main focus)

Pick A, B, or C. If you prefer, name a different sub-point.

While you decide, here are two short, ready-to-use topic‑sentence options (pick one to use or adapt):

- For A (jobs): However, automation also displaces workers, causing job losses that can lead to economic hardship and greater inequality.
- For B (dependence/skills): Another problem is that automation fosters over‑reliance on machines and erodes practical skills, which can reduce people’s independence and creativity.
- For C (combined): Despite its benefits, automation can both displace workers and encourage over‑reliance on machines, resulting in economic hardship and a decline in human skills.

Next — brief, focused edits you can make to the supporting sentences (I’ll keep these short so you can try them, or I can apply them if you want):

1) Sentence 1 (explain job loss / link to topic sentence)
- Replace “Firstly, some jobs are replaced by automation. Thus, people lose their jobs, which leads to a fact that many people fall to acquire money to support their families.”  
- Suggested idea: Give a clearer cause → effect: “For example, when factories automate production, many routine jobs disappear, and displaced workers often struggle to find new employment.”

2) Sentence 2 (explain broader consequence or cause of dependence)
- Replace the long, unclear sentence about dependence and “development of humanity” with a clearer consequence: “As industries depend more on machines, workers may stop practicing certain skills, which can reduce human problem‑solving ability and make economies more vulnerable if technology fails.”

3) Sentence 3 (link to children/education point if you want to keep it)
- Make it concise and connected: “If young people rely too much on automated tools, they risk losing opportunities to learn practical and critical thinking skills.”

4) Concluding line of paragraph (link back to thesis)
- A short wrap that connects to the balanced thesis: “These social and economic effects show that, alongside efficiency and safety benefits, automation can create serious negative consequences that need attention.”

Would you like me to:
- Option 1: Insert one of the topic sentences you pick and apply the supporting-sentence changes into the paragraph, then show the full revised essay?
- Option 2: Try one revised sentence now (you pick which), and I’ll give quick feedback so you can continue editing?

Tell me A, B, or C for the focus, and whether you want Option 1 (I’ll make the edits and show the full essay) or Option 2 (you try a sentence first).

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:37:10.121Z

**You:** In conclusion, from my perspective , the automation employed in many industries is a trending that nobody can change. It can ultimately enhance prospects in the long term as long as we make full use of it correctly. I hope you can give me some recommends to optimize it

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:46:23.861Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this conclusion already does two useful things: it tries to give a final opinion and it points toward a forward-looking recommendation. A few focused changes will make it clearer, stronger, and more academic.

Quick strengths
- You state a viewpoint and try to close with a recommendation.
- The general idea — automation is here to stay but must be managed — is appropriate.

Main problems to fix (brief)
- Language and grammar: remove extra commas and incorrect words (e.g., “a trending” → “a trend” or “an unstoppable trend”; avoid “the automation”).
- Hedging and voice: avoid “from my perspective” in a short concluding sentence — be decisive.
- Specificity: “make full use of it correctly” is vague; say how (retraining, regulation, careful adoption).
- Link to thesis: quickly restate the main reasons you discussed (efficiency/safety vs job loss/dependence) so the conclusion ties back to the essay.

Three short stems you can use to rewrite the conclusion (pick one and fill it in)
- Stance + summary + recommendation stem:
  Overall, [state your clear position], because [brief summary of 1–2 main reasons]; to minimize harm, [brief policy/practical recommendation].
- Stance + concession + action stem:
  Although automation [acknowledge a downside], it is ultimately [state position]; therefore, [what should be done to keep benefits and reduce harms].
- Recommendation‑focused stem:
  To ensure that automation benefits society, governments and companies should [main action], while individuals should [individual action such as retraining or learning new skills].

Three quick wording fixes you can apply immediately
- Replace “In conclusion, from my perspective , the automation employed in many industries is a trending that nobody can change.” with a version that:
  - removes “from my perspective,”
  - uses “automation” (no “the”),
  - changes “a trending” → “a trend” or “an inevitable trend” (if you want stronger language).
- Replace “It can ultimately enhance prospects in the long term as long as we make full use of it correctly.” with a more specific action (e.g., “It can improve long‑term prospects if governments and businesses provide retraining and regulate its use.”)
- Fix spacing and punctuation: remove extra spaces before commas and after sentences.

Would you like to try rewriting the conclusion now using one of the stems? Paste your one‑ or two‑sentence revision and I’ll give focused feedback and one short suggestion to refine it.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:46:47.015Z

**You:** It can improve long‑term prospects if governments and businesses provide retraining and regulate its use. Can you adjust the sentence using better structure

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:50:11.242Z

**Assistant:** Nice revision idea — good clarity and specificity. Here’s a smoother version of that sentence:

Automation can improve long-term prospects if governments and businesses provide retraining programs and regulate its use responsibly.

I’ve inserted that sentence into your essay below (only the final sentence of the conclusion is changed):

---

Would you like help tightening the first sentence of the conclusion too, or polishing grammar and word choice across the whole essay?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:50:36.321Z

**You:** Automation can improve long-term prospects if governments and businesses provide retraining programs and regulate its use responsibly. Maybe this sentence is too absolute，after all，we never know what will happen in the futuer

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:53:28.408Z

**Assistant:** Good point — that sentence can sound too certain. A small change in wording will keep your recommendation while acknowledging uncertainty. Here are three short options (pick one):

- Slightly hedged: "Automation could improve long-term prospects if governments and businesses provide retraining programs and regulate its use responsibly."
- More cautious: "Automation may improve long-term prospects if governments and businesses provide retraining programs and regulate its use responsibly."
- Explicit uncertainty: "While the future is uncertain, automation may improve long-term prospects if governments and businesses provide retraining programs and regulate its use responsibly."

My recommendation: use the third version — it keeps your recommendation but explicitly recognises that outcomes aren’t guaranteed.

Below is your full essay with the conclusion replaced by the third (recommended) option. Read it and tell me if you prefer one of the other two choices instead — or if you want the conclusion shortened or linked more clearly back to the thesis.

**You:** OK.That is so great now.Thank you

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:55:42.323Z

**Assistant:** You’re very welcome — well done for your thoughtful edits and engagement!

Quick summary of what we improved together
- Thesis: Rewritten as a clear, balanced preview of pros (efficiency, safety) and cons (job loss, reliance).
- Positive paragraph: Topic sentence clarified and supporting sentences edited for clearer examples and links to the thesis.
- Conclusion: Made more specific and actionable (retraining + regulation) and toned to acknowledge uncertainty.

If you want to continue, here are a few focused next steps you can pick from (choose one)
1) Revise the negative paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences) so it matches the improvements we made to the positive paragraph.  
2) Full grammar and word-choice pass on the whole essay (spelling, articles, punctuation, sentence structure).  
3) Convert the balanced thesis into a clear stance (stronger argument) and tweak paragraphs to match.  
4) Practice short edits yourself: I give 2–3 micro-tasks (e.g., fix 5 sentences), then give feedback.

Which would you like next? Or would you prefer a quick list of the top 8 sentence-level corrections to apply yourself?
