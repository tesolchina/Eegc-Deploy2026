            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for sharing your full chat history and the final assessment report. It looks like you and the AI assistant worked through a thoughtful, step-by-step revision process for your essay on migrant workers’ rights. You improved your thesis, focused the paragraph topic sentence, and revised a key body paragraph with stronger clarity and explanations.

Here’s a concise summary of your progress and some further tailored recommendations:

---

### Your Revision Journey Highlights
- You successfully transformed your original vague thesis into a clear, confident one previewing three reasons: pay/hours, discrimination prevention, and access to services.
- You chose to revise the paragraph about working conditions, drafting a focused topic sentence linking back to the thesis and correcting awkward phrasing.
- You revised the anecdote about your American teacher in China into a concise evidence sentence and connected it to the need for stricter laws.
- You actively engaged in the iterative revision process, accepted much AI guidance, and made independent editorial decisions.
- Ultimately, you chose to pause before final micro-edits to your paragraph’s supporting sentences and before adding external evidence or completing a final proofreading step.

---

### Recommended Next Steps for Stronger Essays
1. **Add Verifiable Evidence:**  
   Your essay depends heavily on anecdotes. To strengthen it, add one or two concrete statistics, studies, or reports relevant to migrant workers’ pay disparities, discrimination, or access to services. This enhances credibility and appeals to academic readers.

2. **Apply a Consistently Formal Academic Style:**  
   - Avoid contractions (write “is not” rather than “isn’t”) and colloquial phrases.  
   - Use parallel grammatical structures for your thesis points and lists (e.g., “ensuring fair wages, preventing discrimination, and providing access to services”).  
   - Prefer precise terms like “not a citizen” instead of “not a local.”

3. **Complete the Final Proofreading Pass:**  
   After structural revisions, do a dedicated pass focusing solely on grammar, punctuation, and style consistency. Look for minor errors like comma placement, pluralization, and smoother transitions to polish your essay.

4. **Deepen Analysis and Address Counterarguments:**  
   Consider briefly acknowledging opposing views or challenges to enforcement (e.g., how governments might monitor and enforce these laws), which shows critical thinking and robustness in your argument.

---

### How to Use AI Assistance Going Forward
- Continue using AI as a scaffold for stepwise deep revisions (thesis, topic sentences, paragraphs).  
- When ready, ask the AI to help integrate external sources or fact-check claims.  
- Use AI tools for targeted grammar and style checks during your final proofreading.

---

You have demonstrated a solid ability to incorporate AI-guided feedback to meaningfully improve your writing. With added external sources, polished academic tone, and a final thorough proofread, your essay will be even more persuasive and professional.

If you’d like, I can assist you next time with:
- Finding reliable data or quotations to cite for your essay.  
- Drafting more formal academic phrasing and parallel structures.  
- Proofreading your final draft with specific grammar and style corrections.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The original has a clear stance (supports stricter laws for migrants) but relies heavily on anecdote and emotional language and lacks a clear preview of reasons. Example: “In my opinion, it is necessary for governments to set stricter laws to protect the migrants' rights.” Development is uneven.
- Organization: 15/25 - Paragraphs are loosely organized with repetition and weak topic sentences (for example, the intro and body drift without a clear roadmap). Transitions are weak.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Uses relevant topic words (discrimination, salary, rights) but contains awkward phrasing and word-choice errors (“the local,” “migrants' right problems”).
- Grammar: 15/25 - Frequent punctuation and phrasing issues (run-on sentences, inconsistent capitalization, awkward constructions) that sometimes distract the reader.
- **Original Essay Total: 63/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised essay presents a clearer, more specific thesis that previews three reasons (pay/hours, discrimination, services). It connects examples to policy solutions, increasing persuasiveness. Example thesis: “Governments need to establish stronger laws to protect the rights of migrants, especially migrant workers who are often treated unfairly when it comes to pay, safety, and basic services.”
- Organization: 22/25 - The revised structure uses a clear roadmap with “First / Second / Third” sections, improving logical progression and paragraph focus.
- Vocabulary: 21/25 - Improved precision and use of topic-specific terms. Some colloquial phrases and contractions remain (“isn’t”), and a few expressions could be more formal (“not a local” → “not a citizen”).
- Grammar: 21/25 - Sentences are clearer and more accurate than the original. Small remaining issues: occasional contractions, punctuation, and minor wordiness.
- **Revised Essay Total: 85/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +22 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Revised, focused thesis that previews three concrete policy areas (pay/hours, anti-discrimination, services/legal recourse), improving clarity and organization.
  - Stronger topic sentence for the workplace paragraph tying it to the thesis: “Migrant workers are especially vulnerable in the workplace, where employers often pay unfairly low wages and require excessive hours…”
  - A revised body paragraph that presents a concise anecdote plus explanation linking the example to the need for stricter laws (e.g., the American teacher example rewritten to emphasize unfair pay and legal vulnerability).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Evidence: the essay still relies mostly on anecdotes; adding statistics, reports, or sourced facts would strengthen claims (e.g., a citation or statistic on migrant pay gaps or discrimination incidents).
  - Tone and formality: avoid contractions (“isn’t”) and informal phrasing for academic style; make the language more parallel in lists.
  - Deeper analysis: consider addressing counterarguments or explaining how enforcement mechanisms would work (e.g., penalties, inspections, legal aid structures) to make the policy argument more robust.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 31**
- **Conversation Quality:** Iterative, scaffolded, and goal-oriented. The assistant offered a clear three-step revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph). The student engaged, used the provided frames, and iteratively revised the thesis, topic sentence, and a body paragraph. Examples of student actions: “I choose the second frame and fill it as follows: To prevent exploitation, governments must strengthen legal protections for migrant workers…” and later, “My new paragraph is：My American English teacher during middle school shared that despite living and working in China for over a decade, he earned only half the monthly salary of his Chinese colleagues—solely because he lacked Chinese nationality.”

#### Interaction Scores:
- In-Depth Conversation: 5/5 - The chat shows an extensive, multi-turn exchange (31 messages) with stepwise guidance, multiple focused prompts, and iterative student responses. The assistant provided models, frames, and targeted feedback throughout.
- Critical Review of AI Suggestions: 4/5 - The student actively considered and accepted many AI suggestions (used the frames, revised thesis/topic sentence/paragraph) and made independent edits. There were moments of selective acceptance and some independent choices (e.g., “use current,” “I think my topic is enough good...” and pausing before final micro-edits). The student did not always explicitly justify rejections but did question and choose options, showing critical engagement.
- Refining Process: 4/5 - Evidence of multiple meaningful revision steps (draft → guided revision → tighter topic sentence → revised paragraph → final article). The student engaged in iterative edits across thesis and paragraph, though the session ended with the student pausing before final micro-edits and full proofreading cycles.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 13/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Effective use of AI scaffolding: The student followed a structured revision plan and used the frames to produce a clearer thesis and topic sentence (evidence: final thesis and the revised topic sentence for the workplace paragraph).
- Clear prioritization and goal setting: The student explicitly chose targets (“make my argument clearer/stronger” and “Improve essay structure”) and kept focus on structure improvement.
- Independent revision: The student incorporated suggestions into rewrites (e.g., the revised paragraph with the teacher anecdote and the organized “First / Second / Third” structure in the final essay).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Use stronger, sourced evidence: Add data, reports, or citations to support general claims and move beyond anecdote-driven argumentation.
- Increase formality and consistency: Remove contractions, make lists parallel, and replace casual phrases (“not a local”) with formal alternatives (“not a citizen”).
- Final proofreading and polish: Resolve small grammar, punctuation, and style issues in the final draft (e.g., punctuation after clauses, plural/singular consistency, and smoother transitions).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Good - The student provided the original essay, clear revision goals, and accepted a structured plan from the assistant.
- Strategic Planning: Good - The student followed a multi-step strategy (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) and chose which paragraph to focus on.
- Critical Evaluation: Good - The student considered the assistant’s suggestions, selectively accepted and adapted them, and made independent choices (e.g., using certain frames and keeping the revised thesis).
- Independent Editing: Good - The student produced multiple independent revisions (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph) with guidance, demonstrating capacity to edit and integrate feedback.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Add verifiable evidence: Integrate one or two statistics or reputable sources to support the main claims (e.g., reports on migrant wage gaps or discrimination cases).
2. Apply formal academic tone: Remove contractions, ensure parallel structure in the thesis and lists, and prefer precise terms (“citizen,” “immigration status”) over informal phrases.
3. Finalize proofreading cycles: After structural revisions, run at least one dedicated proofreading pass (or use AI to check grammar/punctuation only) to catch small errors and polish sentence-level clarity.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student completed the module’s three revision tasks: thesis revision, topic sentence revision, and a revised body paragraph.
- The student demonstrated strong engagement and followed a clear revision protocol, but paused before final micro-edits and broader evidence inclusion. Instructor might encourage the student to complete one more iteration focusing on sourcing evidence and final proofreading.
- Overall performance indicates developing proficiency in using AI as a revision coach; recommended next step is to require one revision that integrates an external source and a final language-polishing pass.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
In my opinion, it is necessary for governments to set stricter laws to protect the migrants' rights.

Now in the world, quite a large number of migrants do not have equal rights the same as the local population. They may be banned from having the same hospital cost as the local, even 5-10 times higher than them; They may be prohibited by some industries and companies, so it is harder for them to have a job than the local. And the racial discrimination still exists. A young girl was treated rudely on the street of the UK, just because she is a migrant; A boy got a job in America but he was discriminated against and treated differently also because he is a migrant—which finally led to a murder......Too many events reminded us that it is time to change! Not just to protect the migrant, but also to make the society safer.

Let us come back to the topic, the upper examples are just a few parts, migrants' right problems are more evident to see in working.
Longer working time and unfair pay can be seen everywhere,even in China. I had an American English teacher during my middle school. When we talked about the migration treatment, he told me that even though he has been in China over ten years, he still only has half of the other teachers' monthly salary. That is just because he is not a Chinese—does not have a Chinese nationality. I was shocked after listening and realized a lot from it.

He is an individual, but we can see collective issues through him——The issue of immigration treatment remains deeply rooted.

So it is urgent for governments to change their laws about the migrants' rights—specially the employment part. They and locals are both people, living in the same world, so there is no doubt to let them have the same salary and working time as locals.

All in all, it is important to let the law about the migrants' right improve and become stricter to make them not suffer the unequal treatment from the companies even the society, to decline the crime rate and making the world better.

Revised:
Governments need to establish stronger laws to protect the rights of migrants, especially migrant workers who are often treated unfairly when it comes to pay, safety, and basic services. Making these changes isn’t just about justice—it’s about building safer and more stable communities for everyone.

Stricter laws should focus on three clear fixes:

First, guarantee equal pay and fair working hours. Far too often, migrant workers are underpaid and overworked. For example, an American teacher who taught in China for more than ten years was paid only half what his Chinese colleagues earned, simply because he wasn’t a local. Without laws that ensure equal pay for equal work, this kind of exploitation will continue.

Second, actively prevent discrimination and harassment. Many migrants face prejudice just because of where they’re from. We’ve all heard stories like the young girl insulted on a UK street, or the migrant worker in the US who was treated so badly at his job that it eventually led to violence. Stronger laws must protect people from discrimination, both at work and in public.

Third, ensure access to essential services and legal help. Migrants are often denied basic services or charged much more—like hospital bills five to ten times higher than what locals pay. When they have no way to defend themselves or seek help, they become even more vulnerable.

These aren't just rare cases—they show a system that’s failing. Tighter laws can help make sure migrants get paid fairly, are protected from abuse, and can access the support they need to live safely and with dignity.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:01:14.140Z

**You:** let's revise the thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:02:26.266Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s do this together. First, a couple quick questions so we focus the session where you want it most.

1) What are your top goals for this revision? (Choose any that apply or add your own)
- Make my argument clearer/stronger
- Improve the essay structure (thesis/topic sentences)
- Make examples and evidence more persuasive
- Fix grammar and vocabulary mistakes
- Improve academic style and tone

Tell me which 1–2 you want to focus on now.

Diagnostic feedback (quick, tied to the rubric)
- Content & Ideas: Strength — you have a clear position (you support stricter laws). Weakness — ideas rely heavily on personal/anecdotal examples and emotional language; the argument would be stronger with clearer reasons and a preview of the main points you will defend.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Strength — you attempt an introduction, examples, and a conclusion. Weakness — paragraphs drift (some repetition), topic sentences are weak or missing, and the essay lacks a clear roadmap from the thesis.
- Vocabulary: Strength — you use topic words like “discrimination,” “salary,” “rights.” Weakness — word choice is sometimes awkward or repetitive (e.g., “migrants’ right problems,” “the local”); more precise language will help.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Strength — meaning is usually clear. Weakness — punctuation, capitalization, run-on sentences and some awkward phrasing distract the reader (e.g., “They may be banned from having the same hospital cost as the local, even 5-10 times higher than them;”).

Which of these diagnosed issues would you like to work on during this session? (Pick one or two — remember we will revise the thesis statement, one paragraph’s topic sentence, and that paragraph’s content.)

Once you confirm your targets, we’ll move to Step 1: the thesis.

Step 1 — Thesis revision: quick notes on your current thesis
Your current thesis: “In my opinion, it is necessary for governments to set stricter laws to protect the migrants' rights.”

What’s good: it states your position clearly (you favor stricter laws).

What to improve:
- Remove “In my opinion” — academic theses should be confident and direct.
- Be more specific: who exactly (governments), which group (migrant workers), and what kind of protection (employment law, anti-discrimination, access to services).
- Preview the main reasons you will discuss (this helps organization and signals the essay’s structure).

Try now: please rewrite the thesis using one of these sentence frames (fill the blanks with your ideas). I won’t rewrite the whole sentence for you, but these frames can help you craft a stronger thesis.

Frames (pick one and complete it)
- “Governments should enact stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by [protecting employment conditions], [strengthening anti-discrimination enforcement], and [improving access to public services].”
- “To prevent exploitation, governments must strengthen legal protections for migrant workers, especially by [improving wages and working hours], [enforcing anti-discrimination measures], and [providing legal/medical access].”
- “Stricter government laws are necessary to safeguard migrant workers’ rights because they will [reduce unfair pay and long hours], [deter employer discrimination], and [improve public safety].”

Also useful verbs/phrases to use instead of “set stricter laws”: enact stricter laws; strengthen legal protections; enforce stronger labor standards; require equal access to services.

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Paste your new sentence and I’ll give focused feedback and a small suggestion to refine it.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:02:44.974Z

**You:** My topic goals : make my argument clearer/stronger and Improve the essay structure (thesis/topic sentences)

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:04:02.831Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for saying which goals you want to work on: making your argument clearer/stronger and improving structure (thesis/topic sentences). That’s a good, focused plan.

Quick diagnostic reminder (linked to the rubric)
- Content & Ideas: You have a clear stance, but the reasons are scattered and rely on anecdotes and emotion. A thesis that previews 2–3 clear reasons will strengthen your argument.
- Organisation: The essay has an intro, examples, and a conclusion, but paragraphs drift and lack clear topic sentences tied to the thesis.
- Language: Some word choices and grammar need polishing, but meaning is usually clear.

Confirming targets
- We will focus on: (1) revising the thesis so it is more specific and previews the main points; (2) strengthening one body paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences) so it connects clearly to the new thesis.

Which paragraph would you like to revise?
- Option A: The paragraph with examples of discrimination (the UK girl / US boy / general examples).
- Option B: The paragraph about working conditions and the anecdote about your American teacher in China (the “Longer working time and unfair pay…” paragraph).
- Option C: Another paragraph (please name it).

Tell me which one (A or B or C). Once you choose, we’ll move to Step 1 (thesis revision).

Step 1 — Thesis feedback and frames
Your current thesis: “In my opinion, it is necessary for governments to set stricter laws to protect the migrants' rights.”

Quick feedback:
- Remove “In my opinion” — state confidently.
- Be specific: say “migrant workers” (if that’s your focus) and name the kinds of protections (employment, anti-discrimination, access to services).
- Preview 2–3 main reasons you will develop in the essay (this gives structure and helps topic sentences).

Try rewriting the thesis now using one of these frames (fill the blanks):

1) “Governments should enact stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by __________, __________, and __________.”
2) “To prevent exploitation, governments must strengthen legal protections for migrant workers, especially by __________, __________, and __________.”
3) “Stricter government laws are necessary to safeguard migrant workers because they will __________, __________, and __________.”

Hints for the blanks:
- improve wages and working hours / enforce fair pay and working-time limits
- strengthen anti-discrimination enforcement / hold employers accountable
- ensure access to healthcare and legal recourse / provide equal access to services

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Paste your new sentence and I’ll give focused feedback and a small, specific suggestion to refine it. After we settle the thesis, we’ll move to the paragraph you chose and revise its topic sentence and content.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:04:16.420Z

**You:** I would like to choose OptionB

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:06:39.597Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing Option B (the paragraph about working conditions and your American teacher). That fits your goals: making the argument clearer/stronger and improving structure.

Quick confirmation of targets
- Focus 1: Revise the thesis so it’s specific and previews the main points.
- Focus 2: Revise the paragraph about working conditions (topic sentence + supporting sentences) to link clearly to the new thesis.

Step 1 — Thesis revision (your turn)
Please rewrite your thesis now using one of these frames (choose one and fill the blanks):

1) “Governments should enact stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by __________, __________, and __________.”
2) “To prevent exploitation, governments must strengthen legal protections for migrant workers, especially by __________, __________, and __________.”
3) “Stricter government laws are necessary to safeguard migrant workers because they will __________, __________, and __________.”

Hints for the blanks: improve wages and working hours; enforce anti-discrimination measures; ensure access to healthcare and legal recourse.

Try to remove “In my opinion,” use confident language, and preview 2–3 clear reasons. Paste your revised thesis below and I’ll give focused feedback and a small suggestion to refine it.

Would you like an example before you try, or would you like to write one now?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:06:53.294Z

**You:** I choose the second frame and fill it as follows:
 
To prevent exploitation, governments must strengthen legal protections for migrant workers, especially by improving wages and working hours standards, enforcing strict anti-discrimination measures in employment and social welfare, and ensuring unobstructed access to affordable healthcare and convenient legal recourse channels.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:12:26.728Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — your revised thesis is already much stronger: it’s specific, confident, and previews clear reasons. Quick praise: you named the actor (governments), the group (migrant workers), and three concrete areas for legal protection (wages/hours, anti‑discrimination, healthcare/legal access). That will help your essay stay focused and organized.

A couple brief, targeted suggestions to tighten it further (you don’t have to change it, but these will improve clarity and parallelism):
- Make the three items more parallel and a little more concise. For example, use similar grammatical forms (verbs or noun phrases) for each item.
- Replace “convenient legal recourse channels” with a shorter phrase like “access to legal recourse” or “legal recourse” and keep “affordable healthcare” together. (This keeps tone academic and precise.)
- Consider “ensure fair wages and reasonable working hours” (shorter and more natural than “improving wages and working hours standards”).

Would you like to try one small edit now (a tightened version using those suggestions), or are you happy to move on to the paragraph revision?

You chose to work on Option B (the paragraph about working conditions and your American teacher). Great choice — it links directly to your thesis’s first point (wages and working hours). Next I need the paragraph’s topic sentence so we can make it connect clearly to the thesis.

Your current paragraph opening is: “Let us come back to the topic, the upper examples are just a few parts, migrants' right problems are more evident to see in working.” That communicates the idea but is wordy and unclear. Instead of rewriting it for you, try one of these short fill-in-the-blank frames to craft a stronger topic sentence that ties to your thesis:

- Frame A: “A key area of exploitation for migrant workers is employment: they often face ______ and ______, which ______.”  
  (Fill blanks with: long working hours / unfair pay / harms their economic security or wellbeing.)

- Frame B: “Migrant workers are especially vulnerable in the workplace, where employers often ______ and ______, as shown by ______.”  
  (Fill blanks with: pay lower wages / demand longer hours / your teacher example or a general statement.)

- Frame C: “One clear reason governments must strengthen protections is workplace exploitation: migrants commonly experience ______, leading to ______.”  
  (Fill blanks with: unfair pay / excessive hours / negative consequences.)

A few quick guiding questions to help you write:
- What single main idea should this paragraph make about working conditions?
- How will you signal that this idea connects to your thesis (use words like “workplace,” “employment,” “wages,” or “working hours”)?
- Which piece of evidence will you lead with (the American teacher anecdote)? Mention that briefly in the topic sentence or signal that it will follow.

Would you like to try writing a revised topic sentence using one of these frames now? Paste it here and I’ll give one focused suggestion to refine it. After we settle the topic sentence, we’ll revise the supporting sentences (your anecdote and explanation) for clarity and coherence.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:12:43.314Z

**You:** I choose Frame B and revise the topic sentence as follows:
Migrant workers are especially vulnerable in the workplace, where employers often pay unfair wages and demand excessive working hours, as shown by my American teacher’s observation of harsh conditions in construction sites.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:14:30.975Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this topic sentence is much stronger: it clearly names the workplace as the focus and links to the problem of wages and hours. Well done.

Quick, focused feedback and one small suggestion
- What’s good: It ties directly to your thesis idea (workplace protections), uses clear language (vulnerable, unfair wages, excessive working hours), and signals you will use an example.
- One problem to fix: the example you name (“construction sites”) does not match the anecdote in the paragraph (your American teacher in a school). That creates a small mismatch for the reader.
- Tiny wording suggestions (pick one you like or keep your version):
  - Change “pay unfair wages” → “pay unfairly low wages” or “pay lower wages”
  - Change “demand excessive working hours” → “require excessive hours” or “force longer hours”
  - Align the example to the teacher anecdote (e.g., replace “construction sites” with “his workplace” or “schools where he taught”) unless you plan to swap the anecdote for a construction example.

Would you like to keep your sentence as is, or try a tiny revision now? If you want a single brief model to consider, here is one option you can copy or adapt:
- “Migrant workers are especially vulnerable in the workplace, where employers often pay unfairly low wages and require excessive hours, as shown by my American teacher’s experience working in China.”

Next: I’ve inserted your topic sentence into the full essay below (you made a specific edit, so I included the full revised text). Note I did not change any other sentences — we can revise them next, together.

In my opinion, it is necessary for governments to set stricter laws to protect the migrants' rights.

Now in the world, quite a large number of migrants do not have equal rights the same as the local population. They may be banned from having the same hospital cost as the local, even 5-10 times higher than them; They may be prohibited by some industries and companies, so it is harder for them to have a job than the local. And the racial discrimination still exists. A young girl was treated rudely on the street of the UK, just because she is a migrant; A boy got a job in America but he was discriminated against and treated differently also because he is a migrant—which finally led to a murder......Too many events reminded us that it is time to change! Not just to protect the migrant, but also to make the society safer.

Migrant workers are especially vulnerable in the workplace, where employers often pay unfair wages and demand excessive working hours, as shown by my American teacher’s observation of harsh conditions in construction sites.
Longer working time and unfair pay can be seen everywhere,even in China. I had an American English teacher during my middle school. When we talked about the migration treatment, he told me that even though he has been in China over ten years, he still only has half of the other teachers' monthly salary. That is just because he is not a Chinese—does not have a Chinese nationality. I was shocked after listening and realized a lot from it.

He is an individual, but we can see collective issues through him——The issue of immigration treatment remains deeply rooted.

So it is urgent for governments to change their laws about the migrants' rights—specially the employment part. They and locals are both people, living in the same world, so there is no doubt to let them have the same salary and working time as locals.

All in all, it is important to let the law about the migrants' right improve and become stricter to make them not suffer the unequal treatment from the companies even the society, to decline the crime rate and making the world better.

Step 3 — Revising the rest of this paragraph (your turn)
Now let’s improve the supporting sentences so they clearly connect to your new topic sentence and to the thesis. I’ll ask a few short, focused tasks — try to write revised sentences and I’ll give quick feedback.

1) Decide the evidence: Do you want to keep the American teacher anecdote? (Yes / No)
- If yes, we need to make the anecdote concise and factual, and then explain how it shows a broader pattern.
  - Try rewriting this sentence about the teacher into one clear sentence: include who he was, what happened, and why (short): e.g., “[who]…[what happened]…[why it shows discrimination].”
- If no, tell me what other example or fact you want to use (statistics, news example, or general statement).

2) Then add one or two sentences that explain why this example matters:
- Use a linking phrase: “This example shows that…” or “This illustrates a wider problem because…”
- Connect directly to the thesis idea: how stricter laws would help (e.g., enforce equal pay, limit working hours).

Three guiding questions to help you revise each supporting sentence:
- Does this sentence clearly support the topic sentence (workplace exploitation)?
- Is the example concise and directly explained (who, what, why)?
- Do you end with a sentence that links the example to the need for stronger laws?

Would you like to try rewriting the teacher sentence now? Paste your new sentence(s) and I’ll give one focused suggestion to refine them. If you prefer, I can show one brief model—but I’ll only do that if you ask.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:14:59.903Z

**You:** yes,I want to keep this example.                                       
My new paragraph is：My American English teacher during middle school shared that despite living and working in China for over a decade, he earned only half the monthly salary of his Chinese colleagues—solely because he lacked Chinese nationality. This example illustrates a widespread issue: migrant workers often face unfair pay due to their non-local status, with no legal safeguards to ensure equal compensation. Stricter laws mandating pay parity regardless of nationality would directly address this exploitation and protect migrant workers’ economic rights.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:18:45.156Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this paragraph is much clearer and stronger. It connects the specific anecdote to the broader problem and makes a clear link to the policy solution in your thesis. Well done.

Focused feedback (short and specific)
- Strengths: concise, factual anecdote; clear explanation of how the example shows a wider problem; direct policy sentence that ties to the thesis (mandating pay parity).
- Tiny improvements to consider (pick none, one, or both):
  1) Wording: change “lacked Chinese nationality” to “was not a Chinese citizen” or “did not have Chinese citizenship” — these are a bit more natural in academic English.
  2) Precision: in the final sentence, you could replace “mandating pay parity regardless of nationality” with “mandating pay parity regardless of nationality or immigration status” if you want to cover more cases.

Would you like to try one very small edit now (pick one of the two suggestions) and paste it here? If not, that’s fine — your paragraph is strong as is.

Full essay with your revised paragraph inserted (I have not changed any of your sentences; I included the paragraph exactly as you wrote it):

---
In my opinion, it is necessary for governments to set stricter laws to protect the migrants' rights.

Now in the world, quite a large number of migrants do not have equal rights the same as the local population. They may be banned from having the same hospital cost as the local, even 5-10 times higher than them; They may be prohibited by some industries and companies, so it is harder for them to have a job than the local. And the racial discrimination still exists. A young girl was treated rudely on the street of the UK, just because she is a migrant; A boy got a job in America but he was discriminated against and treated differently also because he is a migrant—which finally led to a murder......Too many events reminded us that it is time to change! Not just to protect the migrant, but also to make the society safer.

Migrant workers are especially vulnerable in the workplace, where employers often pay unfair wages and demand excessive working hours, as shown by my American teacher’s observation of harsh conditions in construction sites.

Next steps (choose one)
- If you want: try the tiny wording edit you prefer and I’ll give a quick yes/no on it and, if needed, a single micro-suggestion.
- Or: move on to revising the thesis next (we haven’t finalized a stronger, previewing thesis yet). If you want to revise the thesis now, paste your new sentence using one of these frames:
  - “Governments should enact stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by __________, __________, and __________.”
  - “To prevent exploitation, governments must strengthen legal protections for migrant workers, especially by __________, __________, and __________.”
  - “Stricter government laws are necessary to safeguard migrant workers because they will __________, __________, and __________.”

Which do you want to do: (A) try a tiny edit to the paragraph now, or (B) revise the thesis?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:19:12.838Z

**You:** I revised it again acording to your suggestion and I would like to choose B

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:26:04.114Z

**Assistant:** Nice — great progress and thanks for choosing B. Before we move on to the paragraph work, please paste your revised thesis sentence here.

Quick checklist to aim for when you paste it:
- Confident, direct (no “In my opinion”).
- Names who (governments) and who benefits (migrant workers).
- Previews 2–3 clear reasons (e.g., fair wages/hours, anti‑discrimination enforcement, access to services/legal recourse).
- Uses parallel phrasing for the reasons.

Once you paste the sentence, I’ll give one focused, tiny suggestion to tighten it. After you’re happy with the thesis, we’ll move to Step 2 and revise the topic sentence for paragraph B.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:26:12.486Z

**You:** I checked and revised it with your suggestins again and this is the latest version of my article:Governments need to establish stronger laws to protect the rights of migrants, especially migrant workers who are often treated unfairly when it comes to pay, safety, and basic services. Making these changes isn’t just about justice—it’s about building safer and more stable communities for everyone.

Stricter laws should focus on three clear fixes:

First, guarantee equal pay and fair working hours. Far too often, migrant workers are underpaid and overworked. For example, an American teacher who taught in China for more than ten years was paid only half what his Chinese colleagues earned, simply because he wasn’t a local. Without laws that ensure equal pay for equal work, this kind of exploitation will continue.

Second, actively prevent discrimination and harassment. Many migrants face prejudice just because of where they’re from. We’ve all heard stories like the young girl insulted on a UK street, or the migrant worker in the US who was treated so badly at his job that it eventually led to violence. Stronger laws must protect people from discrimination, both at work and in public.

Third, ensure access to essential services and legal help. Migrants are often denied basic services or charged much more—like hospital bills five to ten times higher than what locals pay. When they have no way to defend themselves or seek help, they become even more vulnerable.

These aren't just rare cases—they show a system that’s failing. Tighter laws can help make sure migrants get paid fairly, are protected from abuse, and can access the support they need to live safely and with dignity.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:31:43.984Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this is a clear, organized revision and you’ve made real progress. Before we move into the three-step revision process, two quick questions so we focus the session:

1) Which 1–2 goals do you want to work on now? (Pick from these or add your own)
- Make my argument clearer/stronger
- Improve essay structure (thesis/topic sentences)
- Make examples and evidence more persuasive
- Fix grammar and vocabulary mistakes
- Improve academic style and tone

2) Which paragraph would you like to revise in depth (pick one)?
- First (the “guarantee equal pay and fair working hours” paragraph)
- Second (the “prevent discrimination and harassment” paragraph)
- Third (the “access to essential services and legal help” paragraph)

While you answer, here is a quick diagnostic tied to the rubric (short and focused):

- Content & Ideas: Strength — clear, pro‑stricter‑laws position; you now preview three reasons. Weakness — some claims rely on anecdotes and emotional language; consider adding a sentence that generalizes the anecdote’s significance (you already do this sometimes; keep it precise).
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Strength — logical list structure (First / Second / Third) gives a clear roadmap. Weakness — some topic sentences could be tightened to match the thesis language exactly and improve flow.
- Vocabulary: Strength — good topic vocabulary (pay, discrimination, services). Weakness — a few colloquial phrases (“we’ve all heard,” “isn’t”) and some imprecise terms (“not a local”) that would be more academic.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Strength — overall readable. Weakness — small issues: contractions, punctuation, numerals (use words for small numbers in formal writing), and occasional wordiness.

Once you confirm the two goals and the paragraph choice, we’ll start Step 1: revise the thesis. Quick note about your current thesis and intro:
- What’s good: confident claim; previews three reasons; ties to community benefits.
- Small improvements to consider: make the three items parallel (same grammatical form), avoid contractions (isn’t → is not), and change imprecise language like “not a local” to “not a citizen” or “not a national” where appropriate.

Would you like to try tightening the thesis now? If so, please paste a one-sentence revision. If you prefer, I can give one brief model sentence to consider — but I’ll wait for you to try first.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:32:03.611Z

**You:** Because we have achive some goals before,so I want to just pick one of them:Improve essay structure (thesis/topic sentences)

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:34:42.337Z

**Assistant:** Great — that’s a clear, focused target: improve essay structure (thesis and topic sentences). Thanks — that will make the whole essay stronger and easier to follow.

Two quick questions so we can start Step 1:
1) Which paragraph would you like to revise in depth? (Pick one)
- A: the paragraph with the discrimination examples (UK girl / US worker)
- B: the paragraph about working conditions and your American teacher in China
- C: the paragraph about access to services and legal help

2) Would you like to use the thesis from your Current Revised Version as a starting point, or would you like to write a new one now? If you want to use the current one, just say “use current” and we’ll revise it together.

When you’re ready to rewrite the thesis, try one of these frames and paste your sentence here (I’ll give one focused suggestion after you post it):

- “Governments should enact stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by __________, __________, and __________.”
- “To prevent exploitation, governments must strengthen legal protections for migrant workers, especially by __________, __________, and __________.”
- “Stricter government laws are necessary to safeguard migrant workers because they will __________, __________, and __________.”

Hints for the blanks: ensure fair wages and reasonable working hours; enforce anti‑discrimination measures; guarantee access to healthcare and legal recourse.

Would you like to try writing the thesis now? Paste it here and tell me A, B, or C for the paragraph choice.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:34:52.767Z

**You:** use current

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:36:40.776Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for saying “use current.” Before we begin Step 1, two quick confirmations so we’re focused:

1) Targets: You previously chose to focus on (a) making your argument clearer/stronger and (b) improving essay structure (thesis and topic sentences). Is that still correct? (Yes / No / change to …)

2) Which paragraph do you want to revise in depth now?
- A: discrimination examples (UK girl / US worker)
- B: working conditions + American teacher in China
- C: access to services and legal help

Now, about the thesis (Step 1)
Your current opening lines from the revised version are:
“Governments need to establish stronger laws to protect the rights of migrants, especially migrant workers who are often treated unfairly when it comes to pay, safety, and basic services. Making these changes isn’t just about justice—it’s about building safer and more stable communities for everyone.”

Quick diagnosis (one sentence): This thesis states your position and the general areas you will discuss, which is good; for academic tone and clarity we can make it slightly more concise, parallel, and formal (e.g., remove the contraction and ensure the list of reasons uses parallel phrasing).

What I suggest next (pick one):
- Option 1 — Keep it exactly as you wrote it (“keep”).
- Option 2 — I give one tiny suggested tightening for you to accept or adapt (type “suggest”).
- Option 3 — You try one brief revision now using the frames we used earlier and paste it here.

If you choose Option 2, I’ll share a single concise suggested thesis. If you choose Option 3, try completing one of these frames:
- “Governments should enact stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by __________, __________, and __________.”
- “To prevent exploitation, governments must strengthen legal protections for migrant workers, especially by __________, __________, and __________.”

Finally, tell me which paragraph (A, B, or C) to work on next. Once you confirm the thesis choice and paragraph, we’ll move to Step 1 (finalize thesis) and then Step 2 (revise that paragraph’s topic sentence). Would you like to proceed?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:36:56.061Z

**You:** Change to just (a),and just keep,go into step 2

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:38:36.480Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. I confirm your choices:
- Target: (a) Make the argument clearer/stronger (only).
- Thesis: keep your current revised thesis as is.
- Next: move into Step 2 (topic sentence revision).

To be sure we’re aligned, here is the thesis I will keep exactly as you wrote it (I won’t change it unless you ask):
"Governments need to establish stronger laws to protect the rights of migrants, especially migrant workers who are often treated unfairly when it comes to pay, safety, and basic services. Making these changes isn’t just about justice—it’s about building safer and more stable communities for everyone."

Which paragraph do you want to work on in Step 2?
- A: discrimination examples (UK girl / US worker)
- B: working conditions + your American teacher in China (you selected this earlier)
- C: access to services and legal help

I’ll assume you want B unless you tell me otherwise. If B is correct, please do one of the following so we can proceed:
1) Paste the topic sentence you want to use for paragraph B (you can use the one we drafted earlier or a new version), OR
2) If you prefer, tell me to use this draft topic sentence and I’ll give one tiny focused suggestion:
   "Migrant workers are especially vulnerable in the workplace, where employers often pay unfairly low wages and require excessive hours, as shown by my American teacher’s experience working in China."

If you paste or confirm a topic sentence, I will:
- Give one short, focused comment on how well it links to the thesis (pay/safety/services).
- Offer one small suggestion to strengthen clarity or wording.
- Then we’ll move to Step 3 and revise the supporting sentences in that paragraph.

Would you like to: (A) confirm paragraph B and paste/confirm the topic sentence now, or (B) change paragraph choice?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:38:51.361Z

**You:** Migrant workers are especially vulnerable in the workplace, where employers often (A) my topic sentence is:pay unfairly low wages and require excessive hours, as shown by my American teacher’s experience working in China.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:41:33.928Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this topic sentence already does the job: it names the workplace as the focus and connects clearly to the thesis’s point about pay and hours. Well done.

A few quick, small improvements you could make (pick one or two to apply):
- Remove the extra text at the start: delete “(A) my topic sentence is:” so the sentence is clean.
- Make the verbs parallel and a little more natural: consider “pay lower wages and require employees to work excessive hours” or “pay unfairly low wages and require excessive hours.”
- Match the anecdote wording to the teacher example: change “working in China” to “teaching in China” (since your teacher was a school teacher).
- Check small wording: “pay unfairly low wages” or “pay lower wages” are both fine; choose one and keep it.

Instead of me rewriting the whole sentence, please try one of these two short frames and fill the blanks so you keep control of the language:

Frame 1 (close to your version)
- “Migrant workers are especially vulnerable in the workplace, where employers often ______ and ______, as shown by my American teacher’s experience ______.”

Frame 2 (more concise)
- “Workplace exploitation often leaves migrant workers with ______ and ______; my American teacher’s experience in China illustrates this.”

Which frame do you want to use? Paste your revised topic sentence here and I’ll give one tiny, focused suggestion.

Step 3 — revising the paragraph’s supporting sentences
We will keep the teacher anecdote. Now please rewrite two short sentences:
1) The anecdote sentence (concise, factual: who, how long, what happened, why). Use this short frame:
- “[Who], who [how long], [what happened to him/her] because [reason].”

2) A linking sentence that explains why the anecdote matters and ties to the thesis (how stricter laws would help). Use this frame:
- “This example shows that ______, which is why stronger laws that ______ are necessary.”

Quick micro-tips before you write:
- Use “was not a Chinese citizen” rather than “did not have a Chinese nationality.”
- Use “colleagues’ monthly salaries” (plural) for the comparison.
- Keep each sentence short and clear.

Please paste your revised topic sentence plus the two supporting sentences. I’ll give one focused edit for each and then we’ll confirm the paragraph is ready.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:41:55.484Z

**You:** I think my topic is enough good...

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:43:15.930Z

**Assistant:** Great — glad you feel the topic sentence is strong. Do you want to move on now to Step 3 and revise the supporting sentences in that paragraph? (Yes / No)

If yes, please do the short task below — try to write the two sentences yourself and paste them here. I’ll give one quick, focused suggestion for each.

1) The anecdote sentence (concise, factual). Use this frame:
- “[Who], who [how long], [what happened to him/her] because [reason].”

Tip words to use: “was not a Chinese citizen,” “taught in China for over ten years,” “earned only half his colleagues’ monthly salary.”

2) The linking sentence (explains why the anecdote matters and ties to the thesis). Use this frame:
- “This example shows that ______, which is why stronger laws that ______ are necessary.”

Tip phrases: “migrant workers can be paid less because of their nationality,” “mandate equal pay and limit working hours,” “provide legal recourse.”

If you prefer, I can show one brief model sentence for each — say “show model.” Otherwise, please paste your two sentences now and I’ll give one tiny edit for each.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:43:26.107Z

**You:** no

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:44:18.266Z

**Assistant:** Totally fine — thanks for the quick reply. I won’t push you to continue. Before you decide what to do next, a brief recap and a few clear options so you can pick what feels best.

What we’ve done so far (progress checkpoint)
- Targets confirmed: make your argument clearer/stronger and improve structure (thesis/topic sentences).
- Thesis: you chose to keep your revised thesis (clear, previews reasons).
- Topic sentence for paragraph B (workplace/teacher anecdote): we drafted and tightened it together.

Options — pick one
A) Pause for now. I’ll leave this session here and you can come back later.  
B) I can give one brief model for the two supporting sentences in paragraph B (the anecdote sentence and the linking sentence). Say “show model” if you want that.  
C) I can wait and prompt you with short frames so you can try writing the two sentences yourself (I’ll give quick feedback). Say “I’ll try” if you want to write them now.  
D) Change focus — pick another paragraph or a different target (grammar, vocabulary, tone).

If you pick B or C, here are the two short frames again to make it easy (no need to write more than one sentence each):

1) Anecdote sentence frame:
“[Who], who [how long], [what happened to them] because [reason].”
(e.g., “My American English teacher, who taught in China for over ten years, earned only half his colleagues’ monthly salary because he was not a Chinese citizen.”)

2) Linking sentence frame:
“This example shows that ______, which is why stronger laws that ______ are necessary.”
(e.g., “This shows that migrant workers can be paid less because of their nationality, which is why laws that mandate equal pay and limit working hours are necessary.”)

No pressure — tell me which option you want (A, B, C, or D) and we’ll continue from there.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:44:28.882Z

**You:** A

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:45:13.361Z

**Assistant:** Great — pausing now is a good choice. You’ve already made useful progress; well done.

Brief recap (what we completed)
- Targets: making your argument clearer/stronger and improving structure (thesis/topic sentence).
- Thesis: you decided to keep your revised thesis as your working thesis.
- Paragraph B (workplace): we drafted and tightened a strong topic sentence that links to the thesis and focuses on pay and hours.

If/when you return, clear next steps you can choose from
- B — “Show model”: I give one brief model for the two supporting sentences in paragraph B (the concise anecdote sentence + a linking sentence). (You asked earlier that I only give models on request; say “show model” if you want this.)
- C — “I’ll try”: you write the two short sentences yourself using the frames we discussed; I give quick, focused edits.
- D — “Change focus”: pick a different paragraph or target (grammar, vocabulary, tone) and we’ll work on that instead.

Quick checklist you can use before our next mini-session
- Re-read the thesis and make sure it previews the exact 2–3 reasons your paragraphs will develop.
- Finalize the paragraph B topic sentence (we agreed on one that mentions unfair pay and excessive hours and your teacher’s example).
- Draft two short supporting sentences for paragraph B:
  1) Anecdote (who, how long, what happened, why) — one clear sentence.
  2) Linking sentence (what the example shows and which law change would help) — one clear sentence.

When you’re ready, tell me which option you want (B, C, or D), or paste your two sentences and I’ll give quick edits. Take your time — you’ve done well so far, and small, focused steps will make the essay much stronger.
