            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your drafts and chat history. Here is a summary of your essay assessment and Human-AI interaction, along with recommendations tailored for your writing progress and collaboration skills with AI.

---

### Summary of Essay Assessment

**Task 1 (Chart Description) and Task 2 (Opinion Essay):**  
- Your original and revised essays are identical; no changes were made despite the suggestions.  
- Strengths: You addressed relevant ideas and formed a clear opinion in Task 2.  
- Areas needing work:  
  - Thesis/overview sentences need clarity and specificity (Task 1 especially).  
  - Paragraph organization and transitions require improvement for smoother flow.  
  - Grammar, phrasing, and vocabulary need refinement to avoid awkward constructions.  
  - Development and examples are general; deeper explanation or nuance would strengthen your arguments.

---

### Human-AI Interaction Review

- **Engagement:** You sought grammatical corrections and sentence improvements, focusing on Task 1.  
- **Implementation:** Despite clear, structured feedback and revision steps provided by the AI, you did not engage in the suggested iterative revision process (i.e., revising thesis, topic sentence, followed by paragraph).  
- **Critical Review:** There was little indication of you critically evaluating or selectively adopting the AI’s suggestions or explaining your choices.  
- **Iteration:** No new drafts or revisions were pasted in the chat, limiting opportunities for tailored feedback and measurable improvement.

---

### Recommendations for Your Writing and Interaction with AI

1. **Follow Through on Revision Steps:**  
   Try to complete the AI’s stepwise revision process by pasting your revised thesis sentence for Task 1 first, then the improved topic sentence, and finally a fully revised paragraph. This lets the tutor and AI give precise feedback and confirm progress.

2. **Engage Critically with Suggestions:**  
   When receiving multiple correction options or feedback, respond with which version you prefer and why. This active reflection helps deepen your understanding and demonstrates your editing skills.

3. **Focus on High-Impact Revisions:**  
   Begin with a clear, concise overview sentence that captures the main trend(s) in the chart. This sets a strong foundation. Then revise topic sentences to directly link to the thesis. Apply grammar and phrasing corrections systematically.

4. **Iterative Practice:**  
   Revise in small steps: submit a draft revision, receive feedback, then adjust again. This incremental approach builds confidence and ensures meaningful improvements.

---

### How to Maximize Future Human-AI Collaboration

- **Context Provision:** You provided helpful context by submitting both original and revised drafts. Keep doing this!  
- **Strategic Planning:** Accept and follow through with the AI’s outlined revision plans; this scaffolding is key to improvement.  
- **Critical Evaluation:** Discuss your choices about suggested edits, even if you decide not to use some.  
- **Independent Editing:** Apply the AI’s corrections in a new draft to visibly demonstrate your learning.

### Next Steps

If you want, paste your current Task 1 thesis/overview sentence here. Then try revising it based on the suggestions, and I’ll give detailed feedback. Together we can work through improving topic sentences and paragraphs to polish your essay clearly and correctly.

Remember, active engagement and iterative revision are the keys to stronger writing and more fruitful AI collaboration. I’m here to support every step of your process!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

Note: The revised essay submitted is identical to the original draft (no text changes were made). Example evidence: Task 1 and Task 2 paragraphs in the "revised" file match the "original" file word-for-word.

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The essays present relevant, on-topic ideas (chart description and an opinion on responsibility for climate change). The opinion essay states a clear position: "I partly agree with both views, but I believe developed countries should do more…". Development is logical but general, lacking deeper examples or nuance.
- Organization: 17/25 - Basic structure is present (introductory sentences, region-by-region description, two main paragraphs in the opinion essay). However, overview/ thesis sentences are weak or imprecise for the chart task, paragraph progression and transitions are uneven, and some repetition occurs.
- Vocabulary: 17/25 - Vocabulary is adequate for the task, with occasional use of topic-specific terms (e.g., "greenhouse gas emissions"). Word choice errors and awkward phrasing reduce precision (e.g., "changeable environments," "the climate changes").
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 15/25 - Frequent grammar errors and awkward constructions (articles, verb forms, punctuation, sentence fragments) affect clarity. Examples: "It’s a such significant issue", "This chart is consisting of 4 parts", "This was the reality to develop industries."
- **Original Essay Total: 67/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - No substantive changes were made in the revised draft; the content remains at the same level of development.
- Organization: 17/25 - Structure unchanged; the chart overview is still diffuse and paragraph transitions unchanged.
- Vocabulary: 17/25 - No improvement in word choice or precision in the submitted revised version.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 15/25 - Grammar errors identified in the original remain present in the revised submission.
- **Revised Essay Total: 67/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None in the submitted revised document. (The chat shows the tutor provided corrections and examples, but the student did not incorporate them into the revised file.)
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Strengthen Task 1 overview/thesis: create a concise summary sentence that reports the overall pattern(s) (e.g., which regions show highest concern and which lowest).
  - Revise topic sentences to explicitly connect each paragraph to the thesis/overview and to indicate whether the paragraph compares regions or explains causes.
  - Apply provided sentence-level corrections (many were suggested in chat) to remove grammar errors and improve clarity—these were not implemented in the revised file.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 7 messages** (assistant and user messages in the provided chat history).
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided a clear plan and concrete sentence-level corrections. The student requested grammatical corrections and chose to focus on Task 1. However, the conversation stops before the student produces any revised sentences or a revised thesis/topic sentence; the student did not paste a revised thesis or adopt the suggested edits into a new draft.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Justification: The chat shows a moderate exchange with clear guidance and several diagnostic responses from the AI. There are 7 total messages and the assistant provided a structured three-step revision plan and many sentence corrections. However, the interaction is not extensive (no 15+ messages) and the student did not carry out iterative revision cycles in-chat.
  - Evidence: Assistant set out Step 1–3 and asked the student to paste the thesis (assistant message at 2025-11-24T09:41:09). The student did not provide a revised thesis sentence in response.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - Justification: The student accepted help and asked for sentence corrections ("Please show me some sentences mistake and correct it") but did not critically evaluate or selectively accept/reject the AI's suggestions in the chat record. There is no evidence of the student providing reasons for accepting or rejecting suggestions or proposing alternatives.
  - Evidence: The assistant provided multiple corrected sentences (e.g., corrected "This chart is consisting of 4 parts." → "The chart consists of four categories."), but the student did not indicate which corrections they would adopt or why.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - Justification: The assistant proposed an iterative three-step process and supplied example corrections; the student made no visible revisions in the chat and did not submit any new drafts. Thus, there is minimal documented iteration.
  - Evidence: Assistant requested the student paste the thesis/overview to begin Step 1; the student instead asked for more sentence corrections and then stopped interaction; the revised essay file remains unchanged.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Willingness to seek help: The student uploaded both original and revised drafts and asked the AI to "Modify the grammatical errors" and later to "enhance the sentences" for Task 1.
  - Evidence: User messages at 2025-11-24T09:36:36 and 09:40:49.
- The AI assistant provided structured, pedagogically sound guidance (clear plan, sentence corrections, stepwise revision instruction).
  - Evidence: Assistant messages with Step 1–3 plan and numerous corrected sentence examples.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Follow-through on revisions: The student did not apply the AI's suggestions to create a revised thesis, topic sentence, or paragraph in the submitted revised file.
  - Recommendation: Paste a revised thesis and one revised paragraph into the chat so the tutor/AI can give targeted feedback and confirm changes.
- Critical engagement with suggestions: The student should evaluate proposed corrections (accept, reject, or adapt) and explain reasoning to demonstrate critical review skills.
  - Recommendation: When the AI proposes multiple correction options, the student should respond with choices and reasons (e.g., "I prefer version B because...").
- Iterative editing practice: Engage in multiple small revision cycles—revise, request feedback, then revise again—so the final draft shows clear improvement steps.
  - Recommendation: Use the AI's three-step plan and complete steps sequentially, pasting each revision for feedback.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided both drafts and indicated which task to focus on ("Task1 enhance the sentences"), supplying sufficient context for targeted help.
  - Evidence: Both essay drafts and request to focus on Task 1.
- **Strategic Planning**: Developing - Student selected Task 1 and sought sentence-level corrections but did not follow the assistant's suggested stepwise revision plan through to completion.
  - Evidence: Assistant proposed revising thesis → topic sentence → paragraph; the student did not submit a revised thesis.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - No evidence the student critically assessed AI suggestions in the chat.
  - Evidence: The student requested corrections but did not discuss or decide which to implement.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - No independent revisions were submitted despite corrections being provided.
  - Evidence: Revised file is identical to original; no newly edited sentences were pasted into chat.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Complete the AI-guided revision cycle: paste a revised thesis sentence (Step 1), then a revised topic sentence (Step 2), then the revised paragraph (Step 3). Request targeted feedback at each step.
2. Be explicit about decisions: after the AI suggests edits, indicate which changes you accept or why you prefer an alternative. This will demonstrate critical engagement and support learning.
3. Focus on the highest-impact fixes first: create a concise overview/thesis for Task 1 (one sentence stating the main trend), improve one topic sentence to clearly link to that thesis, then apply the AI's sentence corrections to that paragraph. After that, apply the same process to other paragraphs.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student engaged with the AI and received high-quality, specific guidance (the assistant listed multiple corrected sentence versions and clear next steps). However, the student did not implement the suggestions in the submitted revised essay. The submitted "revised" file is unchanged from the original, so no credit for revision can be recorded.
- Recommend prompting the student to re-submit a revised draft that incorporates at least the following: (a) a clear overview/thesis for Task 1, (b) a revised topic sentence for one paragraph, and (c) the fully revised paragraph using the suggested sentence-level corrections. This will allow a substantive reassessment of improvement and human-AI collaboration skills.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Task 1:Nowadays, people live in an unprecedented world because of the changeable environments. It’s a such significant issue that everyone is focusing on the climate changes. The chart shows the percentage of respondents in different global regions who view climate change as a threat.
This chart is consisting of 4 parts. In Latin America and the Caribbean, 69% consider climate change a “very serious” threat — the highest share among the regions. And the whole region’s figure is 84% at the same time. Concern is lowest in Southeast Asia: 36% say “very serious,” 24% “somewhat serious,” and 40% say “not a threat” or “don’t know.” Eastern Asia has only 24% who see it as “very serious,” but the highest share (56%) who consider it “somewhat serious.”
The survey reveals significant global divergence in perceptions of climate change as a threat. While some regions express overwhelmingly high concern, others view it as considerably less serious. Overall, a majority of respondents across all regions still perceive climate change as some level of threat to their countries.


Task 2:Climate change is a serious problem that affects the whole world. Some people believe developing countries will suffer more from rising temperatures, while others argue that developed countries should bear the main responsibility.  I partly agree with both views, but I believe developed countries should do more because of their greater resources and historical emissions.
First, developing countries are often poorer and have fewer resources to deal with the effects of climate change. For example, many lack the technology or funds needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, they are more vulnerable to natural disasters like floods and droughts, which can destroy crops and harm people's livelihoods. Therefore, it is true that developing nations will suffer more from climate change.
Second, developed countries have contributed more to the problem over many years. Countries such as the United States and those in Europe used large amounts of fossil fuels during industrialization, releasing significant amounts of carbon dioxide.
This was the reality to develop industries. Because of their historical emissions, they have a moral obligation to lead efforts to reduce emissions and help poorer nations adapt. They have more money and technology to develop cleaner energy sources.
In conclusion, while developing countries face greater risks, I believe that developed nations should take on more responsibility due to their historical role and greater capacity. Both sides need to cooperate to solve this urgent problem and protect the environment for future generations.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-24T09:35:04.227Z

**You:** Modify the grammatical errors according to the main idea of each article

*Time:* 2025-11-24T09:36:36.058Z

**Assistant:** Hi — I’m glad you’ve brought these drafts. Before we start revising, let’s agree a clear plan so our time is focused and useful.

1) Quick goal check
- What do you most want to improve today? (Choose any: clarity, argument strength, structure/organisation, evidence/development, grammar, word choice/style, or something else.)
- Do you want to work on Task 1 (the chart/report), Task 2 (the opinion essay), or both? If both, tell me which one is higher priority.

2) My suggested targets (pick or edit these)
- Strengthen a clear, specific thesis that previews main points.
- Improve topic sentences so they link directly to the thesis.
- Tighten paragraph unity and add clearer explanations/evidence.
- Fix key grammar and sentence-level errors for readability.

Tell me which two or three of those you want us to focus on.

3) Diagnostic feedback (brief, by rubric)
I looked at both drafts. Here’s a short diagnosis with strengths and main weaknesses.

Task 1 (chart description)
- Thesis & Purpose: Strength — you identify the topic (concern about climate change). Weakness — no clear summary sentence that precisely states the main trend(s) shown in the chart.
- Organization: Strength — you attempt to describe regions separately. Weakness — paragraphing and sequencing are uneven; some sentences repeat data without clear comparisons.
- Evidence & Development: Strength — you cite many percentages. Weakness — some numbers are unclear or misphrased; comparisons need clearer framing (what is being compared to what).
- Language Use: Main weakness — frequent grammar and word-choice errors (articles, plurals, verb forms, punctuation) and awkward phrasing that obscure meaning.

Task 2 (opinion essay)
- Thesis & Argument: Strength — you have a position: developed countries should do more. Weakness — thesis could be sharper and preview main reasons more clearly.
- Organization: Strength — clear two main paragraphs (developing both sides). Weakness — topic sentences could more strongly connect to the thesis and signal each paragraph’s role.
- Evidence & Development: Strength — you give logical reasons (resources, historical responsibility). Weakness — examples are general; could be slightly more specific or better explained.
- Language Use: Main weakness — grammar and sentence-level errors (articles, agreement, word order, some run-on sentences). Style sometimes informal or repetitive.

4) Decide priorities
From the points above, which of these do you want to focus on in this session? (Pick up to three—e.g., sharpen thesis, revise one topic sentence + paragraph unity, correct grammar in that paragraph.)

Also tell me: which essay are we working on first? And confirm the specific targets you choose.

When you confirm, please share the current thesis statement for the essay you want to work on (just paste the sentence you currently have). Then we’ll move to Step 1: revise the thesis. Would you like to begin with Task 1 or Task 2?

*Time:* 2025-11-24T09:37:44.218Z

**You:** Task1 enhance the sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-24T09:40:49.966Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. We’ll work on Task 1 (the chart description) and focus on enhancing the sentences. Before we start the three-step revision, a few quick planning questions so we can be focused and efficient.

1) Quick goal check
- From this list, what do you most want to improve today? (pick one or two)
  - clarity
  - argument/summary strength (clear overall message about the chart)
  - structure/organisation
  - evidence & comparison (how you use the data)
  - grammar and sentence-level correctness
  - word choice/style

2) My suggested targets for Task 1 (pick two or three or edit them)
- Strengthen a clear, specific thesis/overview sentence that summarizes the main trend(s) in the chart.
- Improve paragraph organisation so the description compares regions logically.
- Tighten sentence-level grammar and word choice to improve clarity.
Which of these would you like to focus on?

3) Brief diagnostic feedback (Task 1) — quick rubric-style summary
- Thesis & Purpose: You introduce the topic, but there’s no clear, specific overview sentence that states the main trend(s) shown by the chart.
- Organisation: You start to describe regions separately, but the order and transitions are uneven. Some sentences just list numbers without comparing or explaining significance.
- Evidence & Development: Good use of numbers, but some figures are unclear or misphrased; comparisons (e.g., highest vs lowest) need clearer language.
- Language Use: Several grammar and word-choice problems (articles, verb forms, plurals, punctuation, awkward phrasing) make the meaning hard to follow.

4) Choose the priorities for this session
From the diagnosed weaknesses, which issues do you want to focus on now? (Pick up to three.)
Examples: sharpen thesis/overview, revise one topic sentence and that paragraph, fix grammar in that paragraph.

Also confirm: we are working on Task 1 first — correct?

Step 1 (Thesis statement revision) is next — before I give feedback, please paste the exact sentence you are using as your thesis/overview for Task 1 (the sentence that summarizes the chart). If you prefer, paste the first two sentences of your draft so I have context.

Once you paste it, I’ll give focused feedback on clarity, strength, and what to include; then I’ll ask you to try a revision. Would you like to paste the thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-24T09:41:09.823Z

**You:** Please show me some sentences mistake and correct it

*Time:* 2025-11-24T09:45:24.766Z

**Assistant:** Nice — thanks for the clear request. Before I correct sentences, a quick check so we’re focused:

1) Quick goal check (one or two answers)
- Which do you most want to improve now? (pick one or two)
  - clarity
  - thesis/summary strength
  - organisation
  - evidence & comparison
  - grammar and sentence-level correctness
  - word choice/style

2) Which essay first?
- Task 1 (chart description) or Task 2 (opinion essay)? (You earlier said Task 1; please confirm.)

3) Which targets from me? (pick up to three)
- write a clear overview/thesis for Task 1
- improve topic sentence and paragraph unity for one paragraph
- fix grammar and awkward sentences in selected paragraph

Once you confirm those, paste the thesis/overview sentence you’re using for the essay you want to work on (or paste the first two sentences). Then we’ll move to Step 1. 

Meanwhile, here are some useful sentence-level corrections from your drafts — I’ll show the original sentence, a short note on the mistake, and a corrected version. These are short examples to help you see patterns to fix.

Task 1 — chart description (sentence corrections)

1)
Original: Nowadays, people live in an unprecedented world because of the changeable environments.
Problem: “changeable environments” is awkward; word order and phrasing unclear.
Corrected: Nowadays people live in a world of rapidly changing environments.

2)
Original: It’s a such significant issue that everyone is focusing on the climate changes.
Problem: “a such,” “the climate changes” and informal phrasing.
Corrected: Climate change is a significant issue that concerns people worldwide.

3)
Original: This chart obviously shows the percentages about current variations across global regions in concern of climate changes.
Problem: Awkward phrasing and wrong prepositions.
Corrected: The chart shows the percentage of respondents in different global regions who view climate change as a threat.

4)
Original: This chart is consisting of 4 parts.
Problem: Wrong verb form; use words for small numbers in formal writing.
Corrected: The chart consists of four categories.

5)
Original: Initially, the number of “very serious threat “people has accounted for 69% in Latin America and the Caribbean, which places first of this part.
Problem: Word order, article use, and unclear phrasing.
Corrected: In Latin America and the Caribbean, 69% consider climate change a “very serious” threat — the highest share among the regions.

6)
Original: However, the concern is the lowest in Southeast Asia, with 36% of “very serious threat “,24% of “somewhat serious threat” and 40% of don’t know or not a threat.
Problem: Punctuation, inconsistent labels, awkward “don’t know or not a threat.”
Corrected: Concern is lowest in Southeast Asia: 36% say “very serious,” 24% “somewhat serious,” and 40% say “not a threat” or “don’t know.”

7)
Original: Also ,we can see that Eastern Asia not only with the number of 24% of “very serious threat”,but also has the highest number of “somewhat serious threat”,which is 56%.
Problem: Grammar and punctuation; unclear construction.
Corrected: Eastern Asia has only 24% who see it as “very serious,” but the highest share (56%) who consider it “somewhat serious.”

Task 2 — opinion essay (sentence corrections)

1)
Original: Some people believe that developing countries will suffer more from the rising global temperatures, while others said that main countries should be responsible for this huge issue.
Problem: Tense mismatch, “main countries” unclear.
Corrected: Some people believe developing countries will suffer more from rising temperatures, while others argue that developed countries should bear the main responsibility.

2)
Original: In my opinion, both views are partly correct, but I think developed countries should do more because they have more resources and have historically caused more pollution.
Problem: Slightly wordy; “have historically caused more pollution” could be clearer.
Corrected: I partly agree with both views, but I believe developed countries should do more because of their greater resources and historical emissions.

3)
Original: First, developing countries are often poorer and less resources to deal with the effects of climate change.
Problem: Missing verb and wrong noun form.
Corrected: First, developing countries are often poorer and have fewer resources to deal with the effects of climate change.

4)
Original: For example, many of them lack advanced technology or financial resources to reduce greenhouse gases.
Problem: Missing “emissions.”
Corrected: For example, many lack the technology or funds needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

5)
Original: Countries like the United States and Europe have used a lot of fossil fuels during their industrialization process, releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide into the air.
Problem: “Europe” is not a country; phrasing can be tightened.
Corrected: Countries such as the United States and those in Europe used large amounts of fossil fuels during industrialization, releasing significant amounts of carbon dioxide.

6)
Original: This is the reality to develop industries.
Problem: Unclear and ungrammatical.
Corrected: This was a consequence of industrial development.

7)
Original: Because of their historical pollution, they have a moral obligation to lead the efforts in reducing emissions and helping poorer nations adapt to climate change.
Problem: “historical pollution” better as “historical emissions”; tighten phrase.
Corrected: Because of their historical emissions, they have a moral obligation to lead efforts to reduce emissions and help poorer nations adapt.

Next steps — pick priorities
- Tell me which targets you choose (from my earlier list).
- Confirm we are working on Task 1.
- Paste your current thesis/overview sentence for Task 1 (or the first two sentences). If you don’t have one, say so and I’ll help you craft one — but I’ll ask you to try a revision first.

Would you like to try rewriting one of the corrected sentences yourself now (I’ll give feedback), or should I point out more sentence corrections from your drafts?
