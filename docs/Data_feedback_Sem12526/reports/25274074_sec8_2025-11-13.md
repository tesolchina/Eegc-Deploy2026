            ## Contribution Analysis

            Certainly! Here’s a polished, clearer, and more formal revision of your original thesis statement paragraph:

---

**Revised:**

Climate change is a serious global issue, and many argue that individual actions are less significant compared to the efforts of governments and large corporations. While government and corporate responsibility is crucial, individual actions remain important because citizens can influence public policy, and personal environmentally friendly choices, though less impactful, also contribute to the overall solution.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

---

## STUDENT TRAINING PROGRESS REPORT: AI Collaboration

### Completion Check
**Required Revision Tasks:**
1. **Revised Thesis Statement:** *Partially done—student worked through multiple thesis versions and received feedback, but has not clearly submitted or confirmed a final revision for assessment purposes.*
2. **Revised One Topic Sentence:** *Student attempted revisions for both topic sentences, showing understanding of academic tone and linking, but did not submit final formal revision accepted by the AI or show completed iterative refinement.*
3. **Revised One Body Paragraph:** *Student did NOT attempt or submit a revised body paragraph; their requests and responses remained focused on sentences and conclusion, not an entire paragraph’s development.*

> **Result:** The student did **not finish** all required revision steps.

---

## AI Collaboration Skills Assessment

### 1. Engagement & Training Process
- **Student actively participated** in a structured conversation around thesis and topic sentence revision, responding to assistant prompts and requesting help, but did not carry out all iterative revisions as prompted.

### 2. Conversation Depth & Critical Thinking
- The **chat included 19 separate exchanges**: Student provided initial draft sections and requested feedback or revisions, receiver step-by-step guidance, and engaged in topic-focused dialogue.
- **Critical Review:** The student displayed some reflection on feedback, asking “how can I make it better such as grammar, statement,” and attempting several versions, but did not fully engage in critical rejection/justification cycles.
- **Refining Process:** The student made small-scale iterative attempts, notably in thesis and topic sentence refinement, but did not proceed to full paragraph revision or multi-level editing.

### 3. Evidence of Course Goal Understanding
- The student **showed awareness of the module’s expectations** (revising thesis, topic sentence, paragraph), but needed more persistence and confidence to complete each phase fully.
- **Context Provision:** The student referenced the essay and its components (e.g., “help me to revise thesis statement…”, “how to revise topic sentences”), indicating some awareness of training goals.

---

## Summary of Progress

### Strengths Demonstrated
- **Active engagement:** Student asked appropriate questions at training points and responded to guidance promptly.
- **Willingness to revise:** Student made concrete attempts to improve thesis and topic sentences, using offered structures and feedback.
- **Basic understanding of academic writing revision:** Demonstrated ability to recognize thesis and topic sentences and consider their linkage.

### Areas for Improvement
- **Full completion of required revision tasks:** Student stopped short of revising a full body paragraph, and didn’t provide fully refined/final versions for thesis and topic sentences.
- **Critical evaluation and justification:** More sustained engagement with assistant’s feedback, including reflection and reasoning, is needed.
- **Iterative refinement:** Student should return to edit repeatedly and review suggested changes rather than making single-attempt drafts.

### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment
- **Context Provision:** *Good* – Student understood task steps but relied heavily on direct prompts.
- **Strategic Planning:** *Needs Improvement* – Student reacted to guidance but did not plan the revision sequence independently.
- **Critical Evaluation:** *Developing* – Student adopted some suggestions but rarely explained reasoning behind choices.
- **Independent Editing:** *Needs Improvement* – Student demonstrated little initiative for paragraph-level revision without prompt.

---

## Recommendations for Future Development
1. **Essay Writing Skills:** Practice completing step-by-step revision tasks fully—always submit a clearly revised thesis, formal topic sentence, and an improved body paragraph.
2. **AI Collaboration:** Engage more deeply with prompts—reflect and justify changes, ask critical questions, and strive for iterative edits at both sentence and paragraph levels.
3. **Overall Improvement:** Develop time management and revision stamina—confirm completed steps before requesting further help, and aim to finish the whole revision cycle by the deadline.

---

## INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- Please encourage the student to persist in the revision cycle—remind them to complete and submit final versions for each assigned revision step.
- Consider additional support or modeling for paragraph-level revisions and for incorporating critical feedback.
- Student’s engagement with the AI shows promise; with more confidence and structure, independent editing and improvement can be strengthened.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I believe with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, it is personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.While the actions of governments and companies are critical in addressing climate change, individual efforts—such as influencing policy and adopting eco-friendly habits—also play a meaningful role.

Individuals make a significant impact on climate policy by pushing governments to act on environmental issues. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions.

But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, Individual lifestyle choices can contribute to reducing the effects of climate change, even if their impact is less direct than government action, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products.

In conclusion, although the actions of individuals alone cannot solve climate change, they remain an important part of the overall effort. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-13T05:31:40.096Z

**You:** How can I make it better such as gammer, statement

*Time:* 2025-11-13T05:33:03.509Z

**Assistant:** Great work on your draft and thank you for sharing it! Let's follow our structured revision process step-by-step so your essay becomes even stronger, clearer, and more academic. Remember, we’ll start with your thesis statement.

**Step 1 – Thesis Statement Revision**

First, could you please copy and paste just your thesis statement here? (This is usually the final sentence of your introduction, but in your essay, it seems to be:  
"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.")

Is that correct, or would you like to clarify what you intended as your thesis statement?

Once you post your thesis sentence, I’ll give you feedback on clarity, focus, and strength. After that, you’ll try revising it based on my comments.

So:  
**Please share or confirm your current thesis statement, and we’ll work on refining it together!**

*Time:* 2025-11-13T05:33:08.460Z

**You:** Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T05:35:50.203Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement. Here it is again for reference:

> "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

**Feedback on your thesis statement:**

**Strengths:**  
- You clearly address the debate about individual actions vs. government/corporate action.
- You present a balanced viewpoint and mention both influencing government and making personal lifestyle choices.

**What can be improved:**  
- The sentence is quite long and a bit complex; this can make your main argument less clear.
- Phrases like “I partly agree” and “I also think” are a bit tentative. Academic writing is stronger if you state your position confidently and directly.
- The thesis should briefly mention the main reasons or points you will discuss in the body. (For example: "influencing government policies" and "adopting environmentally friendly habits".)
- Try to avoid extra words like "which is very important." Focus on the role or impact instead.

**Guiding questions for revision:**
- Can you state your position clearly and directly in one or two sentences?
- Can you show what your two main supporting points will be?

**Let’s try revising!**  
Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now, keeping this feedback in mind? If you’d like a hint or a structure to try, just let me know!

**You:** help me to revise thesis statement and prepare the example

*Time:* 2025-11-13T05:37:25.319Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let’s work through your thesis statement revision together.

First, here is your original thesis again:
> "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

**Key things to remember for an improved thesis in academic writing:**  
- Be clear and direct  
- State your position confidently (avoid “I think” or “I partly agree” if possible)
- Preview the main points (influencing government and changing personal habits)
- Use academic tone and more formal phrases

---

**Let’s break it down with an example structure:**  
> “Although individual actions may seem less significant than government or corporate efforts, they are important because citizens can push for stronger environmental policies and set examples through their own green habits.”

**You do NOT need to copy or use this sentence—it's just to show the structure!**

Now, it’s your turn:

- Try to combine your position and the reasons you will discuss (influencing government AND personal lifestyle choices) into a strong, direct thesis.
- You could start: “While individual choices may not have as much impact as... they are still important because...”  
- Or: “Individual actions contribute to addressing climate change, both by influencing government policy and by encouraging sustainable habits in society.”

**You:** how to revise topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-13T05:41:45.402Z

**Assistant:** Great! Now that we've worked on your thesis, let's move to **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision** for one of your body paragraphs.

Here’s how we’ll proceed:

1. **Choose a Paragraph:**  
   Please decide whether you want to work on your first body paragraph (about citizens influencing government) or your second body paragraph (about personal lifestyle choices).

2. **Copy Your Current Topic Sentence:**  
   Find the first sentence of that paragraph. Please copy and post it here.

3. **Let’s Review and Revise:**  
   I’ll give you feedback on how well your topic sentence connects to your revised thesis, as well as its clarity and strength. We’ll then revise it together, following a similar process to the thesis statement.

---

**Guiding questions for topic sentence revision:**
- Does your topic sentence clearly state the main idea of this paragraph?
- Does it connect back to your thesis?
- Is the language confident and precise?

**Next step:**  
**Please choose which body paragraph you’d like to improve (government or lifestyle), and copy its current topic sentence here. We’ll work on making it stronger together!**

*Time:* 2025-11-13T05:41:50.314Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. 
\

*Time:* 2025-11-13T05:42:47.136Z

**Assistant:** Excellent—thank you for sharing that topic sentence:

> "The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians."

**Feedback on your topic sentence:**

**Strengths:**
- It clearly focuses the paragraph on the role of citizens in influencing government and politicians.
- It gives a clear direction for what the paragraph will discuss.

**What can be improved:**
- The phrase “the most important way” might sound a bit absolute. Your thesis suggests a balance between influencing government and personal habits, so it’s good to be careful with that.
- To create a strong link with your revised thesis statement (which likely states that individual action matters through both influencing government and setting examples), reflect that connection.
- Using academic language can strengthen your argument—consider terms like “citizens,” “policy change,” or “impact.”
- Clarity: Make sure it’s clear this paragraph is about how individuals have impact by shaping government action.

**Guiding question:**
Can you think of a way to reword your topic sentence so that:
- It directly connects to your revised thesis
- It uses confident and precise language
- It clearly sets up the paragraph’s focus on government influence

**For example, you could start with:**  
“Individuals make a significant impact on climate policy by pushing governments to act on environmental issues.”  
**(But don’t copy—try creating your own version!)**

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now?**  
Share your attempt here, and I’ll offer feedback or help you refine it further!

**You:** individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling

*Time:* 2025-11-13T05:43:26.757Z

**Assistant:** It looks like you’ve shared part of the topic sentence for your **second body paragraph**:  
> "individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling"

Thank you! Let’s focus on revising this topic sentence following our guidelines.

---

### **Feedback on Your Topic Sentence**

**Strengths:**  
- The sentence introduces the idea of personal lifestyle changes.
- It is clear and easy to understand.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- The topic sentence could be more academic and confident (starting with a stronger phrase helps).
- It should clearly connect to your thesis by indicating why personal lifestyle choices matter in the context of climate change.
- Avoid starting with “also” unless you want to directly link to the previous paragraph—in this case, consider making it stand alone.

---

### **Guiding Questions & Suggestions**
- Can you state clearly that the paragraph will discuss how individual actions/personal lifestyle choices contribute to fighting climate change?
- Does your topic sentence signal its importance or impact, even if it's not as strong as government action?
- Try using more academic words like "contribute," "address," "mitigate," "environmental impact," "sustainable habits," etc.

---

### **Prompt for Revision**
Would you like to try revising your topic sentence using these ideas?  
**For example, you might start:**  
> “Individual lifestyle choices can contribute to reducing the effects of climate change, even if their impact is less direct than government action.”

*(Remember, don’t copy this—try to write your own version!)*

Please write your revised topic sentence below, and I’ll give you feedback before we move to revising the rest of the paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T05:43:31.159Z

**You:** while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless

*Time:* 2025-11-13T05:44:23.907Z

**Assistant:** Great try! You’ve brought in the idea from your thesis that individual actions matter, although they are limited in effect. That’s a good starting point for a topic sentence.

**Strengths in your draft topic sentence:**
- It captures the idea that individual actions, though limited, are still meaningful.
- It is clear and easy to understand.

**Areas for improvement:**
- “They are not completely useless” is clear, but could sound a little negative or informal in academic writing.
- For a topic sentence, try to be more specific about what the paragraph will discuss (the actual types of individual actions and their effects).
- Make sure the topic sentence doesn't just repeat the thesis/conclusion, but introduces the focus of this paragraph (personal lifestyle changes).

---

**Guiding questions to refine it further:**
- What kind of actions are you talking about? (For example: personal lifestyle choices or daily habits)
- How do these actions contribute (even in a small way) to helping with climate change?
- Can you use more formal/academic language (instead of “useless”)?

---

**Would you now like to try revising your topic sentence again, making it:**  
- More specific about what the paragraph discusses  
- Using more academic/formal wording  
- Connected to your revised thesis, but not just repeating it

*If you’d like a helpful structure, try something like:*  
"Although individual actions alone are not enough to resolve climate change, adopting sustainable personal habits can meaningfully contribute to environmental protection."

**But remember—try to put it in your own words!**  
Write your new topic sentence below, and I’ll give you quick feedback before we move to the rest of the paragraph!

*Time:* 2025-11-13T05:44:29.120Z

**You:** In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.(help me to revise this paragraph)

*Time:* 2025-11-13T05:46:03.776Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely—let’s revise your *conclusion paragraph* together! But first, let’s review the topic sentence you’ll use for this paragraph (which typically is your first sentence). Since this is your concluding paragraph, the topic sentence should restate your overall position in a clear and confident way, without simply repeating your thesis word for word.

**Your current topic sentence is:**
> In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless.

**Feedback:**
- “In conclusion” is a good start for a concluding paragraph.
- “They are not completely useless” is a bit too informal/negative for academic writing. Try a more positive, confident phrase instead (such as “they still play a meaningful role”).
- Make sure your topic sentence clearly restates your balanced position about both government influence and personal action, summarizing your main points.

**Would you like to try rewording your topic sentence?**
For example:  
> “In conclusion, although the actions of individuals alone cannot solve climate change, they remain an important part of the overall effort.”

(But remember, try it in your own words!)

---

**Now, let’s work on the rest of your conclusion paragraph.** Here’s your draft again with some guiding questions for each sentence:

> The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment.
- **Does this sentence clearly summarize your argument about influencing government? Can you connect this to your thesis using formal language?**

> At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective.
- **Can you rephrase this to stress that personal actions, while less impactful, support climate action when combined with larger efforts?**

> In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.
- **This is a strong final thought, but you might consider using slightly more formal academic language (e.g., “collaborative effort among governments, corporations, and individuals is necessary”).**

---

### **Guiding questions as you revise:**

- Do all your sentences tie back to your revised thesis?
- Are you using clear and formal language?
- Is your concluding sentence strong and clear?
- Are you avoiding informal wording (like “not completely useless”)?

---

**Would you like to try revising these sentences, one at a time, based on these suggestions?**  
You can rewrite the first supporting sentence now, and I’ll give you feedback before you move to the next one.  
Let’s build your conclusion step by step—just reply with your new version of the second sentence (“The most important thing is…”), and we’ll continue!

*Time:* 2025-11-13T05:46:10.825Z

**You:** Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do.

**Feedback and Hints for Revision:**

**Strengths:**  
- You address both main ideas: influencing government and personal green choices.
- You show a balanced viewpoint, not just focusing on one side.

**Areas to Improve:**  
- The sentence structure is a bit confusing; it’s difficult to follow your main point.
- Try to use more formal academic English: avoid “I partly agree” and “I believe.”
- Try stating your position directly and confidently.
- Preview your main points—what will your essay discuss? (For example: influence on government *and* value of personal habits.)

---

**Guiding Questions:**  
- Can you clearly state your position (e.g., “Although individual actions may be less impactful than…”)?
- Can you briefly mention both main points?

---

**Sentence Structures to Help You (Do *not* copy, just use as a guide):**
