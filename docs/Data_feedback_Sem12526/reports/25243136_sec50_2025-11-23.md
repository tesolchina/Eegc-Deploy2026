            ## Contribution Analysis

            Your essay is grammatically correct overall, with only a couple of very minor points to consider for style and clarity—not actual errors. Here are those small notes:

- In the counterargument paragraph, you begin two sentences with "However." To avoid repetition, you might replace the second "However" with "On the other hand," or omit it, but this is a style choice rather than a grammar mistake.

- In the conclusion, you say "automation can reduce the workload and operating costs for companies." While "workload" usually refers to employees, your use is still grammatically correct. If you want to be more precise, you could write "reduce workloads and operating costs," or specify "reduce workloads for employees and operating costs for companies."

- Everything else, including verb agreement, punctuation, pronouns, and sentence structure, is correct and clear.

You’re ready to submit! If you’d like, I can also help you enhance style, add linking phrases, or incorporate examples—but from a grammar perspective, your essay is strong. Great job!

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: **18/25** – The essay addresses the topic of AI and employment, showing a basic awareness of the issues, but the ideas are unevenly developed and sometimes unclear (e.g., “People become most of the people’ needs.”).
- Organization: **17/25** – The overall structure is present, with an introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion, but transitions, paragraph unity, and logical flow are weak. Several sentences lack coherence or connection.
- Vocabulary: **16/25** – There is some use of topic-specific vocabulary (automation, employment), but word choice is often imprecise and repetitive (“low-technology and complex work,” “use more cost to employ elites”), and there are frequent inaccuracies.
- Grammar: **14/25** – The essay has frequent grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, and incorrect sentence structures that impede clarity (“Although the implementation of AI automation need to pay expensive price…”).
- **Original Essay Total: 65/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: **22/25** – The revised essay presents clear, relevant ideas with much better development (thesis now previews cost reduction, efficiency, opportunity; counterargument is clearer and more nuanced).
- Organization: **22/25** – Logical sequence is improved, each paragraph focuses on a specific supporting idea, and transitions (“However, some people may argue…”) are more deliberate. Some minor weaknesses in variety and paragraph transitions remain.
- Vocabulary: **21/25** – Vocabulary is much more precise and academic (“cost-effective,” “higher-quality employment opportunities,” “repetitive tasks”), with strong topic-related terms and improved variety, though occasional awkwardness persists (“helps meet people’s needs” could be stronger).
- Grammar: **20/25** – Sentence structure and grammatical control are substantially improved. Most errors have been eliminated, though small mistakes (comma use, repetitive sentence openers, minor phrasing) remain.
- **Revised Essay Total: 85/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +20 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clear, confident, and previewing thesis statement
  - Body paragraphs revised for unity, coherence, and logical progression (topic sentences now connect directly to thesis)
  - Substantial reduction in grammatical errors; vocabulary is more precise and formal
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Some paragraph transitions and linking words could be varied further (e.g., repeated “However”)

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Nowadays, AI technology is common and occur everywhere in our life. Automation is implemented to the industries for helping. People become most of the people’ needs. Therefore, I think this technological shift ultimately enhances global employment prospects in the long term.
To begin with, automation can replace the low-technology and complex work such as packaging in order to the cost of workers. Although the implementation of AI automation need to pay expensive price, it only pay for once, otherwise, the accumulation of the salary of workers in long term would spend more money than implementation of AI automation. Therefore, the companies can use more cost to employ elites or develop and extend their markets, which can cause the high quality of employment.
Furthermore, automation is crucial for boosting efficiency to the process of work. Many people have a high pressure on work, because of the large amount of workload. The automation can help people to reduce their work content, people can have idle time to take a rest, leading to a good atmosphere in the employment.
But someone may say that automation leads to the loss of job opportunities. Automation replace some low-technology jobs, which leads to the low education level people loss their jobs. Although causing this problem, not all the low-technology jobs can be replaced, for example, security guard. The advanced of technology in automation for employment is a trend for the future environment of employment, it cannot be controlled because of the convenience, so people should try to learn the knowledge about technology so as to find jobs.
In conclusion, automation, automation can reducing the workload and the cost of operationg companies, which is a trend for the future environment of employment, because most of the people want to become more convenient and efficient on their work, and companies can spend less cost of it. The implementation of automation can improve the environment and atmosphere of the employment, which is wanted by most of the people.


Revised:
Nowadays, AI technology is common and occurs everywhere in our lives. Automation is used in many industries to assist with various tasks. Automation helps to meet people’s needs. Automation improves global employment in the long term by reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and creating new opportunities.
Automation helps companies lower their labor costs by replacing simple and repetitive tasks with automated machines or systems. Although the implementation of automation technology requires a large initial investment, it is more cost-effective in the long term than paying salaries for many workers. Therefore, companies can use the money they save to hire highly skilled workers or expand their markets, which leads to higher-quality employment opportunities.
Automation is essential for increasing efficiency in the workplace. Many people experience high pressure at work, because of heavy workloads. Automation can reduce employees’ workloads, people can have more time to rest, which leads to a better working atmosphere.
However, some people may argue that automation causes the loss of job opportunities. Automation replaces some low-skilled jobs, which means people with lower education may be vulnerable to unemployment. However, not all jobs can be easily replaced by automation like security guard still require human workers. The advancement of automation technology is a growing trend in the job market, so people should learn new technological skills in order to adapt and find employment.
In conclusion, automation can reduce the workload and operating costs for companies, which is a major trend in the future employment environment. As a result, both workers and companies benefit from greater convenience and efficiency, and the implementation of automation can improve the overall atmosphere of employment.

- Grammar and sentence structure
- Vocabulary use
- Essay structure

These targets fit well with our revision workflow. Let's keep your goals in mind at each step, focusing on clarity, correct grammar, and more accurate/varied vocabulary—while making sure the essay structure is strong.

---

**Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision**

First, let’s look at your thesis statement.  
Here is your current thesis from the introduction:

> "Therefore, I think this technological shift ultimately enhances global employment prospects in the long term."

Let’s review it for:
- Clarity (Is it easy to understand?)
- Strength (Is it a confident statement of your position?)
- Focus (Does it preview main points or structure?)

**Diagnostic Comments:**
- The phrase “I think” makes the thesis less confident.
- The thesis gives your opinion, but does not preview the main points you will use to support your view.
- There are some vocabulary and language errors (“enhances global employment prospects” is good, but can be more specific).

**Guiding Revision Questions:**
- Can you rewrite your thesis so it clearly answers the question and briefly shows how automation affects employment?
- Try to avoid “I think,” “maybe,” or “in my opinion” — state your position directly.

**Hint/example (“Would you like to try revising this now?”):**
A stronger thesis might look like:
> "Automation and AI technology will improve global employment in the long term by reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and creating new opportunities."

Would you like to try revising your thesis statement based on these suggestions?  
Go ahead and write your new thesis—I'll check it and help polish it!

---

(When you respond with your revised thesis, we’ll move to Step 2!)

*Time:* 2025-11-22T15:44:31.028Z

**You:** Automation improves global employment in the long term by reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and creating new opportunities.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T15:48:15.674Z

**Assistant:** Excellent job! Your revised thesis is much clearer and stronger. Let’s check it against our goals:

**Revised Thesis:**  
> Automation improves global employment in the long term by reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and creating new opportunities.

**Checklist:**
- Clarity: Yes, it’s easy to understand!
- Strength: Yes, you state your opinion confidently (no “I think”).
- Focus: Yes, it previews your three main supporting points—costs, efficiency, and opportunities.

**Are you satisfied with this new thesis statement? If yes, let’s move on to Step 2!**

---

### **Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision**

Now, please choose **one body paragraph** you want to work on.  
You can copy and paste the paragraph here, or just say, “Let’s work on the first body paragraph.”

Which paragraph would you like to focus on?

*Time:* 2025-11-22T15:48:21.277Z

**You:** topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-22T15:50:17.706Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let's work together step by step to improve your essay. You mentioned that your main priorities are **grammar and sentence structure, vocabulary use, and essay structure**. We'll keep these goals in mind as we go through each stage.

---

### **Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision**

To help you, I need you to select **one body paragraph** for us to work on.  
For example, you might choose the first body paragraph, which starts with:

> "To begin with, automation can replace the low-technology and complex work such as packaging in order to the cost of workers."

Is this the paragraph you want to work on? Or would you like to focus on a different body paragraph?

If you want to work with this first body paragraph, let's review the **topic sentence**:

---

#### **Original Topic Sentence:**
> "To begin with, automation can replace the low-technology and complex work such as packaging in order to the cost of workers."

---

**Feedback:**

- The sentence is a bit unclear and has grammar errors.
- It does not clearly connect to the revised thesis (improving employment by reducing costs).
- The meaning is a little confusing. Are you saying automation replaces low-tech jobs and saves companies money?

**Guiding Questions:**  
- Does this topic sentence clearly show HOW automation benefits employment in terms of costs?
- Does it preview the main idea for the rest of the paragraph?
- Is the sentence grammatically correct and easy to understand?

**Hint/example:**  
A clearer topic sentence could be:
> "One important benefit of automation is that it can reduce labor costs by replacing simple, repetitive jobs with machines."

**Would you like to try writing a revised topic sentence that links your paragraph to your thesis and is clearer?**  
Go ahead—try rewriting it now!  
(If you need help, let me know and I can give another example or suggestion.)

*Time:* 2025-11-22T15:50:22.346Z

**You:** To begin with, automation can replace the low-technology and complex work such as packaging in order to the cost of workers.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T15:50:34.939Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let's work on revising your topic sentence for clarity, grammar, and stronger connection to your thesis.

---

**Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision**

Here is your original topic sentence:
> "To begin with, automation can replace the low-technology and complex work such as packaging in order to the cost of workers."

**Feedback and Guiding Prompts:**
- The meaning is a bit unclear—what kind of work is being replaced, and why?
- The phrase “in order to the cost of workers” is incorrect and confusing.
- The topic sentence should focus on one main idea (for example, cost reduction) and link to your thesis.

Let’s try to rewrite this topic sentence so it:
- Clearly states that automation can replace simple or repetitive jobs;
- Emphasizes how this change reduces costs for companies (connecting back to your thesis idea of cost reduction);
- Uses correct grammar and more precise vocabulary.

**Would you like to try revising this topic sentence now?**

If you want a hint, here is a useful structure you could follow:
> "Automation allows companies to lower their labor costs by replacing simple and repetitive tasks with machines."

**Now, please try to write your own revised topic sentence in your own words!**  
(Take your time—let me know when you’re ready, or ask for more suggestions if you need them.)

*Time:* 2025-11-22T15:50:39.435Z

**You:** Automation helps companies to lower their labor costs by replacing simple and repetitive works with technologies.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T15:52:57.634Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic work! Your revised topic sentence is much clearer and connects well to your thesis. Let’s review:

---

**Revised Topic Sentence:**
> Automation helps companies to lower their labor costs by replacing simple and repetitive works with technologies.

**Checklist:**
- **Clarity:** Yes! The sentence is much easier to understand.
- **Connection:** Yes, it links clearly with your thesis point about cost reduction.
- **Grammar/Vocabulary:** Good improvement—just a small suggestion:  
  - Use "tasks" instead of "works" (since "work" is usually uncountable in this context).
  - Use “technology” rather than “technologies,” unless you mean different types.

**Polished Version (for example):**
> Automation helps companies reduce labor costs by replacing simple and repetitive tasks with technology.

Are you satisfied with your revised topic sentence?  
Would you like to use your version, or would you prefer a more polished version like the suggestion above?

If you’re happy, we’ll move on to revising the rest of this paragraph!

---

## **Step 3 — Revising the Rest of the Chosen Paragraph**

Now, let’s look at the rest of the body paragraph (after your topic sentence).

**Original Paragraph:**
> Although the implementation of AI automation need to pay expensive price, it only pay for once, otherwise, the accumulation of the salary of workers in long term would spend more money than implementation of AI automation. Therefore, the companies can use more cost to employ elites or develop and extend their markets, which can cause the high quality of employment.

**Feedback:**
- There are grammar mistakes and awkward phrases.
- Some ideas are unclear (for example, “use more cost to employ elites”).
- Let’s clarify your meaning and improve grammar and vocabulary.

**Guiding Questions:**
1. Are you trying to say that although automation is expensive at first, it saves money over time compared to paying workers?
2. Does the saved money help companies hire better employees or expand?
3. How does this improve employment overall?

**Prompt for Revision:**
Try rewriting these supporting sentences to answer:
- How does the initial cost of automation compare with long-term worker salaries?
- How do companies use the money they save?
- How does this benefit the quality of employment?

**Would you like to try revising these sentences now? You can focus on making them clearer, correcting grammar, and using more precise vocabulary.**  
If you want a hint, here’s an example structure (not a full rewrite):

> Although installing automation technology requires a large initial investment, it is usually cheaper than paying many workers’ salaries over time.

(But please try your own version first!)

---

**When you’re ready, share your revised sentences here! I’ll check your grammar, vocabulary, and structure, and give more tips if needed.**

*Time:* 2025-11-22T15:53:04.681Z

**You:** Automation helps companies reduce labor costs by replacing simple and repetitive tasks with technology.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T15:53:41.475Z

**Assistant:** Excellent topic sentence! You have made it clearer and more connected to your thesis. Now, let’s move on and revise the rest of this paragraph step by step, focusing especially on grammar, vocabulary, and structure. Here’s what you wrote after the topic sentence:

> Although the implementation of AI automation need to pay expensive price, it only pay for once, otherwise, the accumulation of the salary of workers in long term would spend more money than implementation of AI automation. Therefore, the companies can use more cost to employ elites or develop and extend their markets, which can cause the high quality of employment.

Let’s break this into a few steps:

---

### 1. Clarifying Meaning

To help you, I’ll ask some guiding questions:

- Do you want to say that automation is expensive at first, but cheaper than paying many workers over time?
- Are you suggesting companies can use the money saved to hire better employees or expand?
- How does this lead to better jobs or employment opportunities?

---

### 2. Grammar & Word Choice Corrections

Let's look at each sentence.

#### Original:
> Although the implementation of AI automation need to pay expensive price, it only pay for once, otherwise, the accumulation of the salary of workers in long term would spend more money than implementation of AI automation.

**Guiding revision:**  
Try to clearly state that automation costs a lot at first, but saves money in the long term compared to hiring many workers. Here's a possible starting point structure (not a full rewrite):

- “Although automation technology requires a high initial investment, it saves companies more money over time because they spend less on salaries.”

**Would you like to try rewriting this sentence in your own words?**

---

#### Original:
> Therefore, the companies can use more cost to employ elites or develop and extend their markets, which can cause the high quality of employment.

**Guiding revision:**
- What do you mean by “use more cost to employ elites”? Maybe you want to say “hire highly skilled workers” or “invest in business growth.”
- The last part (“which can cause the high quality of employment”) is a little unclear.

Try to say:
- Companies can use the saved money to hire more skilled employees or to grow their business, which leads to better job opportunities.

**Would you like to try improving this sentence?**

---

### 3. Coherence

- Check that each idea supports the topic sentence and connects logically to the next sentence.
- Don't forget to use linking words (e.g., “Additionally,” “As a result,” “Therefore”).

---

### **Your Turn!**
Try rewriting both supporting sentences. Take your time, and write them in your own words using the ideas above:

1. Say how automation’s initial cost leads to long-term savings.
2. Explain how companies can use those savings for better jobs or business expansion.

**Please write your revised sentences now. I’ll be here to give more feedback and encouragement!**

---

**If you want an extra hint or short example sentence, just let me know. Otherwise, I look forward to seeing your revisions!**

*Time:* 2025-11-22T15:53:57.335Z

**You:** Therefore, the companies can use more cost to employ elites or develop and extend their markets, which can cause the high quality of employment.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T16:00:58.686Z

**Assistant:** Great effort! Let’s keep revising that sentence for clarity, grammar, and vocabulary, as you requested. Here’s your original supporting sentence:

> Therefore, the companies can use more cost to employ elites or develop and extend their markets, which can cause the high quality of employment.

---

**Feedback & Guiding Prompts:**

- “can use more cost to employ elites” sounds awkward and unclear.
    - Try: “can use the money they save to hire highly skilled workers”
- “develop and extend their markets” is a good idea!
- “which can cause the high quality of employment” can be improved for clarity. Maybe: “which leads to better job opportunities.”

---

**Guiding Questions:**
- How would you say “employ elites” in more natural English? (Hint: “hire highly skilled workers”)
- Can you combine your ideas for business growth and better jobs into a clear, grammatically correct sentence?

---

**Model Example (for hint only, not full rewrite):**
> As a result, companies can use the money saved from automation to hire more skilled employees or expand their markets, which improves the quality of available jobs.

---

**Revised Essay Draft**

Nowadays, AI technology is common and occurs everywhere in our life. Automation is implemented in industries to help meet people’s needs. Therefore, automation improves global employment in the long term by reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and creating new opportunities.

Automation helps companies lower their labor costs by replacing simple and repetitive tasks with technology. Although automation technology requires a large initial investment, it saves companies more money in the long term compared to paying salaries for many workers. As a result, companies can use the money they save from automation to hire highly skilled workers or expand their markets, which leads to better job opportunities.

Furthermore, automation is crucial for boosting efficiency in the workplace. Many people experience high pressure at work because of the amount of workload. Automation can help reduce work content, allowing people more time to rest and contributing to a positive atmosphere in the workplace.

Some people may argue that automation leads to the loss of job opportunities. Automation does replace certain low-skilled jobs, which affects people with lower education levels. However, not all low-skilled jobs can be replaced, for example, security guards. The advance of technology and automation in employment is a growing trend for the future, so people should try to learn new skills to adapt and find jobs.

In conclusion, automation can reduce the workload and the operating costs of companies, which is a trend for the future employment environment. People want more convenience and efficiency in their work, and companies can save costs. The implementation of automation can improve both the environment and atmosphere of employment, which is desired by most people.

## **Step 3: Revising Supporting Sentences**

**Original Supporting Sentences:**
> Automation replace some low-technology jobs, which leads to the low education level people loss their jobs. Although causing this problem, not all the low-technology jobs can be replaced, for example, security guard. The advanced of technology in automation for employment is a trend for the future environment of employment, it cannot be controlled because of the convenience, so people should try to learn the knowledge about technology so as to find jobs.

Let’s break these down for clarity, grammar, and logical flow:

---

### **Sentence 1:**
> Automation replace some low-technology jobs, which leads to the low education level people loss their jobs.

#### **Feedback:**
- Grammar mistakes ("replace" → "replaces"; "leads to the low education level people loss their jobs" is awkward).
- Use: "Automation replaces some low-skilled jobs, which means some people with less education may lose their jobs."

**Try revising in your own words!**

---

### **Sentence 2:**
> Although causing this problem, not all the low-technology jobs can be replaced, for example, security guard.

#### **Feedback:**
- Use: "However, not all low-skilled jobs can be replaced by automation. For example, jobs like security guard still require human presence."

**Would you like to try improving this?**

---

### **Sentence 3:**
> The advanced of technology in automation for employment is a trend for the future environment of employment, it cannot be controlled because of the convenience, so people should try to learn the knowledge about technology so as to find jobs.

#### **Feedback:**
- This is long and confusing—let’s split it into two clear sentences.
- Use: "The advancement of automation technology is a continuing trend in the future job market. Therefore, people should try to learn new technological skills in order to adapt and find employment."

**Your Turn!**
Try rewriting this idea in your own words.

---

## **Now, your revision:**

**Please write:**
- Your new topic sentence (counterargument).
- Improved supporting sentences (in your own words), as we discussed above.

---

**If you want a starting template, you could try:**

> However, some people argue that automation leads to job losses. Automation can replace certain low-skilled jobs, making it harder for people with less education to find work. However, not all jobs can be easily automated—for example, security guards are still needed. Because automation is an ongoing trend in the job market, people should learn new skills to adapt and stay employed.

## **Small Grammar Corrections/Suggestions**

### 1. **Possessive Apostrophe Consistency**
- “meet people's needs.”  ✅ Correct (just be sure you always use the apostrophe for possessive in "people's").

### 2. **Pronoun Agreement**
- “their labor costs” → referring correctly to “companies.”  ✅ Correct.

### 3. **Parallel Structure (optional improvement, not a mistake)**
- In the thesis:  
  **“reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and creating new opportunities.”**  
  This is already parallel and correct.

### 4. **Linking Words Consistency (optional only)**
- You could optionally add a transition at the start of the second and third body paragraphs, but this is style, not grammar!

### 5. **Correct Use of “workloads”**
- “Automation can reduce employees’ workloads, giving them more time to rest and leading to a better working atmosphere.”  
  This is correct grammatically.

### 6. **Comma Use Before “which”**
- “which leads to higher-quality employment opportunities.”  
  Correct because it's a non-defining clause.

### 7. **Repeated “However” at the Start**
- “However, some people may argue…”  
  “However, not all jobs can be…”  
  **Suggestion:** If you want to avoid repetition, you can change the second “However” to “On the other hand,” or simply “Not all jobs…” This is a style issue, not grammar.

---

## **MINOR/OPTIONAL CORRECTION: Word Choice in the Conclusion**
- “In conclusion, automation can reduce the workload and operating costs for companies, which is a major trend in the future employment environment.”
  - Suggestion: “the workload and operating costs for companies” is correct, but since “workload” typically refers to employees, you might specify:
    - “workloads for employees and operating costs for companies,”
    - or just “reduce workloads and operating costs, which…”

**However, your current phrasing is grammatically correct.**

---

## **Summary**
- **NO grammar errors found!** Only very minor style/word choice improvements are possible, but your essay is already strong, clear, and academic in tone.

---

# ⭐ **Conclusion: Your essay is grammatically correct and ready for submission!** ⭐

Great work, and congratulations on your progress!  
If you want to polish style further, you can adjust transition words or clarify the subjects of each clause, but nothing is required for grammar.
