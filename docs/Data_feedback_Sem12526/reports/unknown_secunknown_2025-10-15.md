## 📈 Your Contribution Analysis

Based on the training assessment report and the chat history, here are some tailored suggestions to help you move forward effectively:

1. **Engage Actively with the AI**  
   The AI assistant is ready to support you, but it needs your input to do so well. Try responding to its questions about your course, goals, and what you want to improve. This will help the AI tailor its advice to your needs.

2. **Provide Context and Goals**  
   When you start a revision session, share details like your course name, assignment requirements, and what you want to focus on (e.g., grammar, vocabulary, argument strength). This helps the AI give more relevant suggestions.

3. **Use the AI Suggestions Critically**  
   When the AI offers corrections or ideas, think about them carefully. You can accept, reject, or modify suggestions based on what makes sense to you. This critical thinking will improve your writing skills.

4. **Make Edits Yourself**  
   The AI can guide you, but you should do the actual rewriting. Try to revise sentences, fix grammar, and improve vocabulary based on the AI’s feedback. This hands-on practice is essential.

5. **Iterate and Revise**  
   Writing is a process. Don’t expect to get it perfect in one go. Use multiple drafts, each time improving based on feedback and your own reflections.

6. **Ask Questions**  
   If you don’t understand a suggestion or want help with a specific part, ask the AI. This will make the interaction more dynamic and productive.

**Next Steps for You:**  
- Reply to the AI’s initial prompt with your course name and what you want to improve.  
- Share any specific concerns or questions about your essay.  
- Try revising one paragraph using AI feedback, then share your revision for further guidance.

If you want, I can help you draft a response to the AI to get the conversation started again. Would you like me to do that?

Original:
Climate change, it is very huge problem now. I think individual actions not so important like what government and big companies do. But still, I kinda disagree because people also can do stuff to help. I will explain my thoughts here.

First, governments and companies, they got more power. They can do big things. Like, government make laws for no pollution. They can stop plastic bags or tell factories to not make so much smoke. Companies also can change their ways. They can use less energy or make stuff that don't hurt environment. This is good because it change many people life at once. So powerful, you know.

But individual actions, they matter too, I guess. If many people do little things, it add up. Like, turn off lights at home save energy. Or buy things from green companies. Then companies think, oh, we must be green to sell more. But sometimes it hard to know if this really work. People don't always do it. Also, one person doing something. It not enough.

Another thing. When people change their life, like stop using car and walk, government see this. Politicians want votes, so they make rules people like. So individual action can push government to do more. Maybe start big movement. But I not sure how many people need to do this for it to work. Just thinking.

Some say individual action too small. One person cannot fix climate change. True, but if million people try, maybe it help. Every small thing count. Or not? I don't know sometimes.

Anyway, I think both individual and government and companies must work. Individual action seem small but if many do it, it big. We need all to fix this problem. Climate change very bad, so everyone must try hard. That's my opinion.
