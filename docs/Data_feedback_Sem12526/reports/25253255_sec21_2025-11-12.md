            ## Contribution Analysis

            Based on the assessment report and the chat history, the student has correctly identified the thesis statement but has not progressed beyond that step—they have not revised the thesis, nor engaged in further dialogue or revisions suggested by the AI. 

To move forward effectively, the student should be encouraged to actively revise the thesis statement by applying the AI’s feedback: making their position clearer and more confident, previewing the two main points in a stronger way, and avoiding tentative language like “I think.” Then, they should proceed with revising topic sentences and body paragraphs accordingly.

If you want, I can help draft a clearer, stronger thesis statement revision example to demonstrate to the student or guide the next steps for the student to try. Would you like me to provide that?

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 – The essay presents two relevant perspectives: the role of citizens in influencing government and the impact of personal green choices. Ideas are generally clear, but some explanations remain surface-level.
- Organization: 19/25 – Paragraph structure is present, with logical progression. Some linking and flow issues appear, particularly in transitioning between examples and contrasting ideas.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 – Vocabulary is mostly appropriate and sometimes topic-specific ("green lifestyle," "carbon emissions"), but there are several repetitive/simple word choices and occasional awkward phrasing.
- Grammar: 16/25 – Simple sentence structures mostly used. Errors such as “so nothing happen” and “so is not always working well” affect clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 73/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 – No substantive changes from original; content remains clear but not further developed.
- Organization: 19/25 – Paragraphing and structure unchanged.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 – No evidence of vocabulary revision or increased variety.
- Grammar: 16/25 – The revised essay is identical; no grammatical improvements.
- **Revised Essay Total: 73/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - No improvements are evident in the submitted revision.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Thesis statement could be rewritten for clarity and strength, as suggested by the AI.
  - Topic sentences remain unchanged; lack of engagement with AI feedback.
  - No revision of body paragraph content or grammar.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:

- **Conversation Quality:** Student identified the thesis statement after AI prompt but did not revise it; no exchanges about topic sentences or body paragraphs; no evidence of deeper inquiry or iterative process.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 – Minimal exchanges. The student did respond to the AI’s prompt but did not advance the conversation to further stages.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 – The AI provided targeted feedback and suggestions for revision, but the student did not engage critically or attempt revision (e.g., no attempt to strengthen thesis, no questions asked).
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 – No revision cycles; the student repeated the thesis statement but did not revise or refine either thesis, topic sentence, or any paragraph.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 5/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Student was able to locate the thesis statement in the draft correctly.
- Student followed initial AI instruction in identifying essay components.
- Student demonstrated readiness to engage at the first step.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Student needs to attempt actual revision of thesis statement as directed.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T08:53:42.082Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

**Assistant:** Great, thank you for sharing your thesis statement! Here it is again for easy reference:

> “I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”

Let’s go through the revision steps for your thesis:

### Feedback on Your Thesis Statement:
- **Clarity:** Your position (“partly agree”) is clear, which is good, but the sentence is a bit long and could be more direct.
- **Focus:** You mention two main points (1: citizens influencing government; 2: personal green choices). That’s good!
- **Strength:** Try to use strong and confident language (avoid “I think” or “I also think”).  
- **Preview:** Good job mentioning both influencing the government and personal lifestyle, but you could make the connection to the essay question stronger by being more specific about how much each matters.

#### Before you revise, ask yourself:
- Does your thesis clearly answer: To what extent do you agree that individual actions matter less than government/company actions in fighting climate change?
- Does it clearly preview the structure of your essay for the reader?

Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now, making it a bit more direct and confident? Remember:  
- State your opinion clearly,
- Preview your two main reasons,
- Use strong, precise language.

Go ahead and post your revised thesis, and I’ll help you polish it further if needed!
