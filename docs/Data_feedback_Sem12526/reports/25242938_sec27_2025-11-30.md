            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing the detailed assessment and your chat history. Here’s a focused summary and some targeted guidance to help you build on your progress and deepen your revision and human-AI collaboration skills.

---

### Summary of Key Insights

**What you did well:**
- You identified clear revision targets (paragraph structure, sentence construction, vocabulary naturalness) and asked specific, focused questions that helped the AI give relevant, rubric-based feedback.
- You implemented many surface-level and higher-level improvements **offline**, such as clarifying your thesis, improving topic sentences, and using more precise vocabulary.
- Your revised essay shows notably better clarity, coherence, and language, with smoother topic sentences and a better balance between migrant and native-born workers' interests.

**Areas where you can grow:**
- **In-chat iterative revision:** Rather than only asking for feedback, try pasting your revised sentences or paragraphs into the chat for immediate, stepwise AI guidance. This live back-and-forth can help you refine more precisely and catch small remaining errors before offline finalizing.
- **Critical evaluation:** Engage explicitly with AI suggestions by accepting, adjusting, or rejecting them *in the conversation* and explaining your choices. This practice strengthens your critical thinking and deepens your editing strategy.
- **Evidence and rebuttal depth:** Your essay would benefit from adding brief, concrete data or a specific example to support key claims (e.g., migrants’ productivity or wage fairness). Also, your counterargument paragraph could be made more persuasive by clearly stating the objection and offering a specific, plausible policy solution that balances native and migrant worker welfare.
- **Concision & repetition:** Watch for and eliminate repeated phrases like “native-born population” in close proximity; instead, use synonyms or pronouns to improve flow and reader engagement.

---

### How You Can Apply This Going Forward

1. **Iterative In-Chat Revision:**
   - After receiving feedback, paste your revised thesis, topic sentence, or paragraph directly into the chat.
   - Ask for line-by-line checks or suggestions for improving clarity, style, or logic.
   - Use AI’s recommendations to further tweak your writing in real time.
   - Keep repeating this process as needed before moving on.

2. **Active Response to AI Suggestions:**
   - When the AI offers fixes or vocabulary swaps, decide which feel right and which don’t.
   - Explain *why* you choose to accept or modify suggestions.
   - This conversation turn builds your confidence in making independent editing decisions while leveraging AI input.

3. **Strengthen Argument with Evidence:**
   - Add a short statistic, example, or fact showing migrants’ contribution or how regulations improved outcomes elsewhere.
   - For your counterargument, specify a balancing policy (e.g., wage floors + local hire incentives) rather than a vague “strike a balance” claim.

4. **Refine Word Choice and Sentence Flow:**
   - Replace repeated phrases with synonyms or pronouns.
   - Break long sentences into shorter, clearer ones.
   - Use precise academic collocations like “fair wages,” “labour protections,” “commitment to work,” and “motivation.”

### Example of Iterative In-Chat Use

Instead of asking generally for “feedback on vocabulary,” try:

> “Here is my revised thesis: ‘The government must enforce strict laws on working hours and wages to protect migrant workers while ensuring fair employment opportunities for local workers.’  
> Can you suggest any word choices or phrasings to make this more formal and precise? If so, please explain why.”

Or for a paragraph section:

> “Here is my revised paragraph topic sentence: ‘Migrants’ economic contributions obligate governments to create protective labor policies.’  
> Is this sentence clear and strong? If not, how can I improve it?”

---

### Final Encouragement

You are clearly capable of applying feedback and making meaningful improvements. To elevate further, focus on deepening engagement with the AI tool during your revision process and explicitly articulating your choices. This will deepen your revision skills and sharpen critical collaboration with AI, which is a valuable 21st-century writing skill.

If you want, we can now practice that iterative process together by revising and refining one statement step-by-step here. Just let me know which part you’d like to work on first!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 15/25 - The essay presents a clear position (that government should protect migrant workers) but ideas are underdeveloped and repetitive. Example problem: “Concerning migrant workers face exploitation due to weak regulations, enduring long hour and unfair pay, from my perspective, government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights.” This sentence is unclear and does not preview organized reasons.
- Organization: 15/25 - There is a basic intro–body–conclusion structure, but paragraphs lack focused topic sentences and logical sequencing; ideas wander and repeat (e.g., multiple sentences repeating “native-born population” without clear progression).
- Vocabulary: 14/25 - Frequent awkward collocations and imprecise word choices (e.g., “enduring long hour,” “sincere to their job,” “paying to the workers rationally”) reduce clarity and register.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Numerous grammar and sentence-structure errors (agreement, article use, sentence fragments) impede readability and coherence.
- **Original Essay Total: 58/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The revised thesis is clearer and balances migrant protection with native-born concerns: “From my perspective, the government should enforce stricter laws on hours and wages to safeguard migrants’ rights while balancing the needs of native-born workers.” The essay adds illustrative examples of migrants’ skills, but supporting evidence remains general rather than concrete.
- Organization: 21/25 - Paragraphing and topic focus improved. The second paragraph opens with a clear topic sentence: “Migrants’ economic role creates a duty for governments to protect them.” Transitions are better, though the counterargument paragraph still repeats material and needs a tighter rebuttal.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Many awkward phrases were corrected (e.g., “unfair wages,” “motivation,” “wages commensurate with their productivity”). Some redundancy remains (repeated use of “native-born population” in the counterargument).
- Grammar: 20/25 - Sentence structure and grammar are much improved (clearer sentences, corrected plurals, better collocations). Minor remaining issues include occasional repetition and slightly awkward phrasing in the counterargument and conclusion.
- **Revised Essay Total: 81/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +23 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Revised thesis for clarity and scope: changed from the original unclear sentence to “the government should enforce stricter laws on hours and wages to safeguard migrants’ rights while balancing the needs of native-born workers.”
  - Stronger topic sentence and paragraph focus: e.g., “Migrants’ economic role creates a duty for governments to protect them.”
  - Improved vocabulary and sentence-level clarity (replaced awkward collocations like “sincere to their job” with “committed to their jobs”; “unfair pay” → “unfair wages”; added concrete examples of migrant skills).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Provide concrete evidence or brief data/examples (e.g., a specific statistic, a short case) to strengthen claims about productivity and labour contributions.
  - Tighten and clarify the counterargument paragraph — it repeats “native-born population” and the suggested solution (“strike a balance”) is vague; a clearer rebuttal with a specific policy example would strengthen persuasiveness.
  - Improve concision in the conclusion and remove residual repetitive phrasing (e.g., “native-born population” repeated).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 6 messages** (assistant introductory message + user question about paragraph structure; assistant response; user question about sentence construction; assistant response; user question about vocabulary naturalness; assistant response).
- **Conversation Quality:** The student asked focused, section-specific questions (paragraph structure, sentence construction, vocabulary naturalness). The AI provided detailed, rubric-based diagnostic feedback and actionable suggestions. However, the student did not engage in iterative revision cycles in-chat (no draft resubmissions or specific accept/reject decisions recorded).

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - The chat shows a moderate, focused interaction. The assistant provided thorough diagnostics and stepwise guidance across several messages, but the overall exchange count is limited (6 messages) and lacks extended back-and-forth revision cycles that would indicate deeper iterative engagement.
  - Evidence: Assistant offered a three-step revision plan and detailed paragraph-level feedback; user responded with several targeted requests but did not perform multiple revision iterations within the chat.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - Limited evidence that the student critically evaluated or rejected AI suggestions in the chat. The student asked for feedback areas but did not indicate acceptance, rejection, or reasoned selection of particular suggestions within the conversation.
  - Evidence: The student asked for feedback on paragraph structure, sentence construction, and vocabulary, but there are no follow-up messages showing evaluation or decisions about which AI recommendations to adopt.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - Minimal iterative revision process evident in the chat. Although the assistant proposed a structured revision workflow (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), the chat shows only initial guidance and no subsequent cycles of student revision and AI feedback within the recorded conversation.
  - Evidence: Assistant prompted the student to choose priorities and offered micro-exercises; the student did not paste a revised sentence or paragraph into the chat for further refinement.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Targeted use of AI: The student asked three clear, focused questions (paragraph structure, sentence construction, vocabulary) demonstrating an ability to identify specific revision needs.
  - Evidence: Chat messages: “Give me some feedback on paragraph structure…”, “Give me some feedback on sentence construction…”, “Give me some feedback on vocabulary naturalness…”
- Effective independent editing: The revised essay shows the student implemented many of the AI’s suggestions offline (clearer thesis, improved topic sentence, better vocabulary).
  - Evidence: Revised thesis and paragraph openings compared to originals (quotes above).
- Improved clarity and organization: The revised draft has better topic sentences and clearer links between claims and policy recommendations.
  - Evidence: Second paragraph topic sentence: “Migrants’ economic role creates a duty for governments to protect them.”

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Engage iteratively in-chat with the AI: paste revised sentences/paragraphs into the conversation for real-time feedback and deeper iterative refinement.
- Demonstrate critical evaluation of AI suggestions: explicitly accept, adapt, or reject recommendations with reasons in-chat to develop stronger critical collaboration skills.
- Strengthen evidence and rebuttal: include a concrete example or brief statistic and a clearer, more specific rebuttal to the counterargument about native workers’ unemployment.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - Student asked focused, course-relevant questions and targeted specific revision aspects, which provided useful context for the AI to tailor feedback.
  - Evidence: The student specified three distinct revision targets in separate messages.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The assistant provided a clear plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), but the student did not follow through in-chat to complete those steps interactively.
  - Evidence: Assistant outlined a three-step revision plan; the student did not run through the steps inside the chat.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The chat lacks explicit student evaluation of AI suggestions.
  - Evidence: No messages show the student weighing options or justifying choices in response to AI suggestions.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The student made substantive offline revisions that applied the AI’s recommendations (demonstrated in the revised essay).

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. When revising with AI, perform iterative cycles in-chat: paste your revised thesis/topic sentence/paragraph and ask for targeted feedback so the AI can help you refine line-by-line.
2. Add brief, concrete evidence (one statistic, a short example, or a cited fact) to support claims about migrants’ economic contributions and the effects of regulation.
3. In the counterargument paragraph, state the objection succinctly and provide a specific rebuttal or policy trade-off example (e.g., conditional hiring incentives for local workers paired with wage floor rules) to make the balance proposal persuasive.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student completed the three required revision tasks: (1) revised thesis statement, (2) revised a topic sentence, and (3) revised at least one body paragraph. Evidence: compare original opening (“Concerning migrant workers face exploitation… government should enforce stricter laws…”) with revised thesis (“Migrant workers often face exploitation ... the government should enforce stricter laws on hours and wages ...”); and the new topic sentence, “Migrants’ economic role creates a duty for governments to protect them.”
- The student used AI help effectively to identify and apply surface-level and structural improvements but did not show in-chat iterative revisions or critical commentary about which suggestions were accepted or why; encourage in-chat iteration and explicit evaluation of AI guidance for stronger human-AI collaboration skills.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Concerning migrant workers face exploitation due to weak regulations, enduring long hour and unfair pay, from my perspective, government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights.
It is no doubt that the migrant pay efforts and time to work, abd we actually need the migrants workers for their professional skills and knowledge, therefore the local companies would like to employ them as the workers. Which we hope to hire migrant workers to boost the development of the country.
With the stricter laws on regulating their working hours which would be similar to the native-born population, enabling then to have satisfaction with their work. Meanwhile, governments should have regulation on paying to the workers rationally, that receiving a reasonable salary for their productivity. It could definitely encourage them to be more sincere to their job, increasing their working incentives, effectiveness and the quality of their working morale could be increased, which could be beneficial to the overall society.

Some may argue that the government has stricter regulation safe guarding the migrant would have disadvantage on the native-born population and thus the native-born population and thus the native-born population unemployment rate is far exceeding the migrants. To deal with these problems, personally governments can strike a balance between the migrants and the native-born population, which is to ensure the welfare and encourage the firms to hire the native-born applicants. Prioritizing the welfare of the native- born population.

In conclusion, governments could safeguard the rights of the migrants and the welfare of the native-born population. Prompting the society to achieve the optimal level.


Revised:
Migrant workers often face exploitation due to weak labor protections, including long hours and unfair wages. From my perspective, the government should enforce stricter laws on hours and wages to safeguard migrants’ rights while balancing the needs of native-born workers.

Migrants’ economic role creates a duty for governments to protect them. There is no doubt that migrants put in effort and time to work, and we employ them for their skills and expertise. For example, migrants could bring more advanced technology skills for our healthcare system, cutting-edge technology for architecture, and these are the reasons why the local companies would like to employ them as workers. We hope to hire migrant workers to boost the country's development.

Setting enforceable limits on working hours and guaranteeing fair pay would improve migrants’ job satisfaction and productivity. Meanwhile, governments should have regulations on paying to workers rationally, that they receive a reasonable salary for their productivity. For instance, fair schedules reduce burnout and fair pay increases motivation. These policies could encourage them to commit to their jobs, increasing their working incentives, effectiveness, and the quality of work. Their working morale could be increased as well,  which could be beneficial to the overall society. Result in that firms could reach higher efficiency, and society could maintain greater stability.

Some may argue that the government has stricter regulations safeguarding the migrants would have a disadvantage on the native-born population and thus the native-born population and thus the native-born population unemployment rate is far exceeding the migrants. To deal with these problems, governments can strike a balance between migrant and native-born workers, which is to ensure the welfare and encourage the firms to hire the native-born applicants. Prioritizing the welfare of the native- born population.

In conclusion, governments could safeguard the rights of the migrants and the welfare of the native-born population. Recognize migrants’ contributions and raise migrants’ working motivations. Prompting the society to achieve the optimal level.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:24:36.100Z

**You:** Give me some feedback on paragraph structure (e.g. coherence, flow)

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:27:28.231Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a great place to start. Before I give focused feedback on paragraph structure, let’s quickly agree targets so I can tailor my help.

1) Quick check-in: what do you most want to improve in this session?
- Paragraph structure (coherence and flow)?
- Or something else too (thesis clarity, argument strength, grammar/style)?
(You already asked about paragraph structure — would you like that to be the single focus, or do you want to add one other priority?)

Once you confirm, I’ll run a short diagnostic and we’ll choose which issue(s) to work on. After that we’ll follow the three-step revision process (starting with the thesis). 

Below is a brief diagnostic (rubric-style) focusing on paragraph structure and related areas so you can see strengths and weaknesses.

Diagnostic feedback (brief)
- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: You express a clear overall position: governments should do more to protect migrant workers.
  - Needs work: The thesis sentence is unclear and grammatically weak; it doesn’t preview the main points clearly.

- Organization
  - Strengths: The essay roughly follows an introduction–body–conclusion structure.
  - Needs work: Paragraphs lack clear, strong topic sentences and logical sequencing. Sentences often wander or repeat ideas, so each paragraph doesn’t stay focused on one main idea.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: You attempt to explain consequences and offer a counterargument.
  - Needs work: Supporting ideas are vague and repetitive. There’s little specific evidence or clear explanation linking claims to the thesis.

- Language Use
  - Strengths: You attempt linking phrases (e.g., “Meanwhile,” “To deal with these problems”).
  - Needs work: Numerous grammar and wording errors interrupt flow and make it harder to follow the paragraph-level logic.

Specific feedback on paragraph structure, coherence, and flow
- Intro paragraph (first sentence + thesis)
  - Problem: The opening sentence mixes ideas (exploitation, hours, pay) and the thesis clause is buried and grammatically unclear.
  - How to fix: Put a clear thesis at the end of the intro that states your position and previews two or three main reasons the government should act (e.g., legal protections, fair pay, balancing with native-born welfare).
  - Tip: Make the intro 2–3 sentences: 1) context/problem, 2) clearer statement of what the essay will argue.

- Body paragraph 1 (about needing migrant workers / companies hiring them)
  - Problem: This paragraph contains several ideas: migrants’ skills, companies hiring them, and a vague hope to boost development. There is no clear topic sentence that ties this to the thesis (why this matters for the argument about stricter laws).
  - How to fix: Start with a topic sentence that states the paragraph’s main point and links it to the thesis (for example, explain how migrants’ economic role creates a duty for governments to protect them). Then provide 1–2 specific supports or short examples and a closing sentence that connects back to the thesis.

- Body paragraph 2 (about benefits of stricter laws + incentives)
  - Problem: Sentences are long, repetitive, and sometimes circular. The paragraph mixes policy proposals, expected effects, and morale claims without a clear mini-structure.
  - How to fix: Break the paragraph into a clear claim → explain how the policy produces the effect → give a short example or consequence → link to thesis. Remove repeated phrases (e.g., “increasing…quality…working morale” can be tightened).

- Counterargument paragraph
  - Problem: This paragraph repeats “native-born population” multiple times and the solution (“strike a balance”) is vague. Also, the paragraph needs clearer transitions between the objection and your rebuttal.
  - How to fix: Start with the counterargument in one clear sentence, then refute it with one piece of reasoning or an example. End by showing why your position still stands.

- Conclusion
  - Problem: The conclusion is short and repeats the thesis without summarizing the main supporting points clearly.
  - How to fix: In 2–3 sentences: restate thesis in stronger language, summarize the two main reasons you gave, and a final sentence about the broader significance.

Concrete, practical tips to improve paragraph coherence and flow
- Topic sentences: Make each paragraph begin with a sentence that states its one main idea and ties to the thesis.
- Unity: Remove sentences that stray off the main idea. If a sentence introduces a different point, move it to a new paragraph or delete it.
- Order: Put general claims first, then explanations, then a brief closing sentence that links back to the thesis.
- Transitions: Use short linking phrases between sentences to show cause/effect or contrast (e.g., “As a result,” “However,” “For example”).
- Concision: Combine or cut repetitive phrases. Shorten long, tangled sentences so the paragraph reads smoothly.
- Replace vague claims with brief, specific support: one concrete example, a fact, or a logical consequence helps the paragraph feel finished.

Now: choose priorities
Which of these would you like us to focus on in this revision session? Pick up to two:
A) Thesis clarity (so paragraphs can connect to it more easily)
B) Topic sentences / paragraph unity
C) Supporting sentences & evidence (making supports clear and relevant)
D) Sentence-level grammar and word choice (to improve flow)

Please tell me which option(s) you choose. Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 1 (Thesis Revision). I’ll ask you to paste or confirm your current thesis (I can quote it from your draft if you prefer), give targeted feedback, and then I’ll ask you to try a revision. Would you like me to quote your current thesis now, or paste your preferred version?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:27:47.114Z

**You:** Give me some feedback on sentence construction (e.g. grammar, variety)

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:31:42.705Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for that clear question. Before I give detailed tips, tell me quickly: do you want this session to focus only on sentence-level grammar and word choice (option D), or would you like to add one more priority (A: thesis clarity, B: topic sentences, or C: supporting sentences & evidence)? Pick one or two and I’ll focus my help there. Once you confirm, we’ll move into the revision steps.

Meanwhile, here is focused, practical feedback on sentence construction (grammar and variety), using short examples from your draft and concrete ways to fix them. I’ll keep this interactive and brief so you can try edits right away.

Top sentence-level issues I see (with how to fix them)
1) Word order and sentence fragments
- Problem: Words are out of order or phrases don’t form a full sentence.
  Example from your draft: “Concerning migrant workers face exploitation due to weak regulations…”
- Fix: Make sure each clause has a clear subject and verb and that phrases are arranged in a normal order: topic → verb → object. Start simple: “Migrant workers often face exploitation because regulations are weak.”

2) Subject-verb agreement, plurals, and verb forms
- Problems: “enduring long hour” → hours; “the migrant pay efforts and time to work” → unclear subject/verb.
- Fix: Match singular/plural: hours, workers, companies. Use clear verbs: “They endure long hours and receive unfair pay.”

3) Articles and determiners (a/the)
- Problems: Missing or incorrect articles: “government should enforce stricter laws” (OK) vs. “migrant pay efforts” (unclear).
- Fix: Use “the” for specific groups or “a/an” for one of many. Example pattern: “The government should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers.”

4) Redundancy and repetition
- Problem: Repeating the same phrase many times (e.g., “native-born population” appears repeatedly).
- Fix: Use pronouns or synonyms and avoid restating the same word in adjacent sentences. For example, alternate “native-born workers” with “local workers” or “the local population.”

5) Long, tangled sentences — break them up
- Problem: Sentences like “It could definitely encourage them to be more sincere to their job, increasing their working incentives, effectiveness and the quality of their working morale could be increased…” are long and confusing.
- Fix: Break into two or three sentences with a clear cause→effect link. Keep one main idea per sentence.

6) Word choice and collocations
- Problems: Unnatural phrases: “sincere to their job,” “working incentives,” “the migrant pay efforts.”
- Fix: Use common collocations: “committed to their work,” “motivation,” “wages,” “working hours.”

7) Connectors and transitions (variety)
- Suggestion: Vary sentence openings and use short linking words: “Because,” “As a result,” “However,” “For example.” This improves flow and shows logical relationships.

Quick micro-exercises you can try now (pick one)
- Replace unclear wording with a simple subject–verb–object sentence: find one sentence and rephrase it in this form.
- Shorten a long sentence into two sentences that each express a single idea.
- Swap a repeated noun with a pronoun or synonym to reduce repetition.

Would you like to:
1) Focus only on sentence-level grammar & word choice (D), or
2) Add one more priority (pick A, B, or C)?

If you’re ready, I can quote your current thesis now and we’ll begin Step 1 (thesis revision) — or you can paste your preferred thesis. Which do you choose? Would you like to try revising a sentence now (tell me which one), and I’ll give targeted feedback?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:31:57.750Z

**You:** Give me some feedback on vocabulary naturalness (e.g. appropriateness, precision)

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:19:17.898Z

**Assistant:** Great — this is a useful, focused question. Below I’ll give short, practical feedback on the vocabulary in your draft: which words/phrases are awkward or imprecise, why, and better choices you can try. I’ll keep suggestions at the word/phrase level so you can practice swapping them in yourself.

What “natural” vocabulary looks like here
- Uses common collocations (e.g., long hours, unfair wages, labour regulations).
- Chooses precise nouns (wages, regulations, morale, motivation) rather than vague phrases (paying to the workers rationally).
- Matches formality to an academic essay (use enforce, implement, safeguard, rather than casual verbs).
- Avoids repetition by using pronouns or synonyms (local workers / native-born workers / the local population).

Problem phrases from your draft + suggested alternatives (short, with reasons)
1) “Concerning” (as sentence starter)
   - Problem: sounds awkward here.
   - Try: regarding / about / “Migrant workers often …” (use “regarding” for short references; use an active clause to open a sentence).

2) “face exploitation due to weak regulations”
   - Good idea, just tighten: “face exploitation because labour regulations are weak” or “face exploitative practices under weak labour regulations.”
   - Reason: “exploitative practices” is a natural collocation; “labour regulations” is specific.

3) “enduring long hour”
   - Problem: singular/plural and collocation.
   - Try: “enduring long hours” or “working long hours.”

4) “unfair pay”
   - More natural: “unfair wages” or “low/unjust wages.”
   - Reason: “wages” is the common noun in this context.

5) “the migrant pay efforts and time to work” (unclear)
   - Problem: confusing grammar and meaning.
   - Try replacing with: “migrants’ working hours and wages” or “the time migrants spend working and their pay.”
   - Reason: clearer noun phrases make the idea readable.

6) “we actually need the migrants workers for their professional skills and knowledge”
   - Polish: “employ migrant workers for their skills and expertise.”
   - Reason: “skills and expertise” is more precise and natural than “professional skills and knowledge.”

7) “satisfaction with their work” / “sincere to their job”
   - Better: “satisfied with their work” / “committed to their jobs” / “more motivated.”
   - Reason: “sincere to” is not a natural collocation.

8) “paying to the workers rationally” / “receiving a reasonable salary for their productivity”
   - Better: “paying workers fairly” / “receiving wages commensurate with their productivity” or “adequate/appropriate pay.”
   - Reason: “fairly” and “wages commensurate with” are common academic phrases.

9) “working incentives, effectiveness and the quality of their working morale”
   - Streamline: “motivation, productivity, and morale” or “increased motivation and productivity.”
   - Reason: fewer words, natural collocations.

10) “strike a balance between the migrants and the native-born population”
    - Slightly smoother: “strike a balance between migrant and native-born workers” or “balance the needs of migrant and local workers.”
    - Reason: avoid repeating “population”; “local workers” is a good synonym.

Tone and formality tips
- Prefer nouns like “wages,” “labour regulations,” “exploitation,” “morale,” “motivation,” “productivity.”
- Prefer verbs like “enforce,” “implement,” “safeguard,” “ensure,” “protect” in policy writing.
- Avoid casual intensifiers like “definitely”; use stronger modal verbs when appropriate in a thesis (should, must).
- Reduce repetition of long phrases (e.g., “the native-born population”) by using pronouns or varied synonyms.

Micro-practice (quick choices you can try now)
- Pick one awkward phrase in your draft (e.g., “sincere to their job”) and replace it with one of the suggestions above.
- Scan the paragraph and replace any instance of “pay” or “paying” with “wages” or “pay/paid fairly” where appropriate.

Would you like to:
- Try one of those word swaps now (tell me which phrase), or
- Move on and choose up to two revision priorities (A–D) so we can begin Step 1 (thesis revision)? 

If you’re ready for Step 1, I can quote your current thesis from the draft — would you like me to do that, or will you paste a version you prefer?
