            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your training assessment and chat history. Here’s a concise summary and next-step advice tailored to your progress:

---

**Summary of Your Training Status:**  
- You actively completed revising topic sentences for both body paragraphs and a full first body paragraph revision.  
- You engaged well with the AI, asked for models, and followed feedback closely.  
- However, the thesis statement revision step was not completed; you simulated it instead of submitting a new version.  
- Your independent editing is developing—you use AI examples extensively and mostly accept suggestions but rarely challenge or deeply personalize them.  
- Overall, you demonstrate strong engagement, academic tone improvement, and willingness to incorporate feedback.

---

**Key Recommendations to Strengthen Your Work:**  
1. **Revise and Submit Your Thesis Statement:**  
   Rewrite your thesis in a clear, confident way that previews both main points (government influence and personal lifestyle choices). Even a short, direct statement will complete this key training stage.

2. **Build Independent Editing Skills:**  
   After reviewing model examples, try writing fully original sentences in your own style. Avoid copying phrases verbatim—experiment with new vocabulary and sentence structures that match your voice.

3. **Practice Critical Evaluation:**  
   When using AI suggestions, question them more. For example, ask yourself: “Does this phrasing best fit my meaning? Could it be clearer? Should I adjust tone or complexity?” Adding your own justifications and edits will deepen your writing skill.

4. **Finish All Revision Steps Fully:**  
   Ensure every training step (including thesis revision) is fully completed, not simulated. This shows mastery of the complete essay-building process.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

Individuals can make the greatest impact on climate change by using actions such as voting, protesting, or public campaigns to push governments to adopt stronger environmental policies.Citizens can most effectively address climate change by taking collective action to influence their governments’ policies. When people organize protests, participate in public campaigns, or vote for leaders who prioritize the environment, they create pressure for lawmakers to introduce measures like banning pollution or investing in renewable energy. For instance, some countries have seen new laws on plastic waste or carbon emissions as a direct result of public advocacy. These examples demonstrate that ordinary citizens working together can achieve significant change, even if individual efforts alone are limited. However, government responses are not always immediate or strong; some leaders may hesitate to take serious action, and sometimes people lack the resources or channels to communicate their concerns effectively.

On the other hand, although recycling or saving energy may seem less impactful than government action, these small actions still contribute to climate action by encouraging eco-friendly habits in society.These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T10:04:08.500Z

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:04:18.818Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:06:49.094Z

**Assistant:** Great! Thank you for sharing your current thesis statement:

> "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Let’s work through Step 1: **Thesis Statement Revision**.

### Feedback on Your Thesis Statement

- **Clarity:** The thesis introduces both sides of your argument (government influence and personal choices). However, the language is a bit wordy, and the “I partly agree…” start is less confident for academic writing.
- **Strength & Focus:** It would be stronger if you directly answer the essay question, *preview your main points*, and use more assertive language.
- **Previewing Structure:** It’s a good idea to briefly mention *how* individuals can make an impact in both ways.

### Questions to Consider

- Can you specify what roles individuals have (e.g., influencing government + adopting green lifestyles)?
- Would you like to try making the thesis more direct and confident?

---

Here’s a gentle prompt to guide your rewrite:

“Would you like to try revising your thesis statement to more confidently present your position and briefly preview the two key roles individuals can play?”

Let’s see your revision before we move on.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:08:06.680Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:30:26.999Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let’s imagine you’ve revised your thesis statement so that it reads more confidently and clearly previews your argument—excellent work!

Now, let’s move forward to **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision.**

**Which body paragraph would you like to focus on revising—the first or the second?**

- The first paragraph discusses individuals influencing governments and politicians.
- The second paragraph discusses individuals making personal green lifestyle choices.

**Please tell me which paragraph you’d like to work on, and then share the current topic sentence for that paragraph.**

Once you do that, I’ll give you specific feedback about how well the topic sentence connects to your new thesis, and we can work together to revise it. 

Which paragraph and topic sentence shall we start with?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:30:30.221Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:35:24.374Z

**Assistant:** Great—you’ve chosen the **first body paragraph** and shared its current topic sentence:

> "The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians."

Let’s work through Step 2: **Topic Sentence Revision**.

---

### Feedback on Your Topic Sentence

- **Connection to Thesis:** This sentence does connect to your thesis, especially if your thesis now clearly highlights individuals influencing government as a major point.
- **Clarity & Focus:** “The most important way...” is strong, but in academic writing, it can help to briefly preview *how* individuals exert influence. Also, the phrase “government and politicians” might be a bit redundant.
- **Confidence:** The topic sentence is quite assertive—good! To make it even better, you could clarify *what kind of influence* or *why this influence matters*.

---

### Guiding Questions

- Can you specify *how* individuals can influence the government—perhaps mentioning voting, protesting, or public campaigns?
- Would you like to try tightening the sentence to avoid vague or redundant terms?

---

Here’s a prompt:

“Would you like to try revising your topic sentence to clearly state how individuals can influence government action on climate change and why this is a significant contribution?”

Let’s see how you revise it! Once you’re happy with your new topic sentence, we’ll move on to revising the rest of the paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:35:35.462Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians, such as mentioning voting, protesting, or public campaigns.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:37:22.927Z

**Assistant:** Nice job trying to add those examples! You’re starting to clarify *how* individuals can influence government action.

Let’s look at your revision:

> "The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians, such as mentioning voting, protesting, or public campaigns."

**Here’s some feedback and questions to help you improve even more:**

- **Clarity:** You give examples (“voting, protesting, or public campaigns”), which is great! But the phrase "such as mentioning" is a bit awkward—perhaps you can be more direct.
- **Focus:** Can you state *why* influencing government is so powerful in the fight against climate change?
- **Language:** The phrase “government and politicians” can be shortened to just “government,” since politicians are already included.
- **Academic Tone:** Try starting with a strong statement, then add examples naturally.

**Guiding questions:**
- What result comes from citizens acting together (e.g., changing laws, making new policies)?
- Can you make the link between individual actions and larger impact clear in the first sentence?

**Would you like to have another try at revising?**
Perhaps aim for a sentence like:  
“Individuals can make the greatest impact on climate change by using actions such as voting, protesting, or public campaigns to push governments to adopt stronger environmental policies.”

But before I suggest more, would you like to give your topic sentence one more revision using this feedback?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:37:29.313Z

**You:** On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:45:31.807Z

**Assistant:** Excellent—you’ve decided to focus on the **second body paragraph** and shared its topic sentence:

> “On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.”

Let’s work through Step 2: **Topic Sentence Revision**.

---

### Feedback on Your Topic Sentence

- **Connection to Thesis:** This sentence relates well to your thesis, which mentions personal green lifestyle choices. Good job!
- **Clarity:** Starting with “On the other hand” helps show contrast, but you might make the sentence stronger by clearly stating why these personal actions matter—even if their impact is smaller than government action.
- **Confidence:** Words like “can also make small changes” are helpful, but you could add confidence by explaining the possible effect of these actions, even if limited.

---

### Guiding Questions

- Can you briefly say *why* small lifestyle changes are valuable, even if not as powerful as influencing government?
- How might these actions contribute to a broader cultural or social impact?
- Would you like to try revising your topic sentence to show the connection between personal actions and their role—however limited—in climate change?

---

**Prompt:**  
“Would you like to try revising your topic sentence to explain why individual lifestyle changes, while less influential than government action, are still an important part of the solution?”

Let’s see your revision! Once you’re happy with the new topic sentence, we’ll move on to revising the rest of the paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:45:36.503Z

**You:** On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive, it is good to protect the invirionment.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:52:23.185Z

**Assistant:** Great effort in revising your topic sentence! Here’s some feedback and questions to help you strengthen it:

### Feedback

- **Clarity and Structure:** The sentence is a bit long and combines two different ideas with a comma splice (using a comma where a new sentence or different connector is needed). Try to separate or connect your ideas more smoothly.
- **Focus:** You give good examples (recycling, using less water, walking), but you can more clearly explain *why* these actions are “good to protect the environment.”
- **Precision in Language:** “Good to protect the environment” is a bit general. Can you be more specific about *how* these small changes contribute, even if on a smaller scale?

### Guiding Questions

- What outcome can result if lots of people take these small actions?
- Why are these behaviors still valuable, even if they’re not as powerful as government decisions?
- How do your examples (recycling, saving water, walking) fit into your main idea about individuals helping with climate change?

---

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence again?**

To guide you: Consider making it two sentences if it feels too long and clearly stating the role these actions play.

Would you like to try again or would you like a model example before moving forward?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:53:33.521Z

**You:** I need a model example.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:54:11.567Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Here’s a **model topic sentence** for your second body paragraph, based on your thesis and the feedback above:

> While personal lifestyle changes like recycling or saving energy may seem less impactful than government action, these small steps still contribute to climate action by encouraging eco-friendly habits in society.

This model:

- Shows clear contrast to government action ("While... less impactful...")
- Specifies what the individual actions are (recycling, saving energy)
- Explains *why* these actions are important ("contribute to climate action by encouraging eco-friendly habits in society")
- Uses clear, academic language.

**Now, would you like to try writing your own topic sentence, inspired by this example, in your own words?**

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:54:41.357Z

**You:** Although recycling or saving energy may seem less impactful than government action, these small actions still contribute to climate action by encouraging eco-friendly habits in society.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:56:33.203Z

**Assistant:** Great job revising your topic sentence!

Now let's continue to **Step 3: Revising the Rest of Your Chosen Paragraph** (the second body paragraph).

---

**Guiding Questions:**

1. **Connection to Topic Sentence:**  
Do all your supporting sentences clearly relate to the idea that personal actions, though smaller, help by influencing society’s habits?

2. **Evidence & Explanation:**  
Can you expand on *how* eco-friendly habits spread—maybe through example or explanation?  
Is there enough detail showing the impact, even if it’s limited?

3. **Unity & Coherence:**  
Are your sentences logically connected?  
Is there a clear and smooth flow from one idea to the next?

---

**Let’s Review Your Paragraph:**

Original version:

> On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

---

**Targeted Feedback:**

- **Link your ideas more clearly** to the revised topic sentence—why do these small actions matter for society?
- **Explain the process:** How do habits spread or influence companies and others?
- **Clarify limitations:** When mentioning “not enough,” be precise about why widespread action is important.

---

**Quick Prompts to Guide Revision:**

- Do your examples (recycling, saving water, walking) clearly show how personal habits spread or influence others?
- Is there enough detail about businesses responding to these habits?
- How can you make the limitations (when people don’t care) more specific, and connect them back to the topic sentence?

**Would you like to try revising one or two sentences at a time?**  
For example, you can focus first on the explanation of how habits spread, then look at the sentence about company responses, etc. Or, if you'd prefer to share an updated version of the whole paragraph, that's fine too!

Let's work together—would you like to revise the first supporting sentence now, or share your improved paragraph for review?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:56:38.922Z

**You:** When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:57:51.294Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! You’ve shared the section of the first body paragraph that explains how individuals can influence government action on climate change. Let’s move through the last step:

---

## Step 3: Revising the Rest of Your Chosen Paragraph (First Body Paragraph)

**Your Focus:**  
Now that you have a strong topic sentence connecting to your thesis, let's ensure the supporting details in this paragraph are clear, well-organized, and connected to your main idea.

---

### Targeted Feedback

#### 1. **Unity:**  
All your examples (protest, voting, joining together) show ways individuals influence government—good job!  
Make sure each supporting sentence is directly related to your revised topic sentence about *how* citizens push government to act.

#### 2. **Clarity & Explanation:**  
- Some sentences (“sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen”) are a bit unclear or informal—try to clearly explain the challenge or barrier.
- Explain why public opinion might not always succeed. Can you clarify with a specific example or restate the limitation more objectively?

#### 3. **Logical Flow:**  
- Group sentences logically. First, explain how individuals can create change; then discuss the challenges or limitations.

#### 4. **Academic Tone:**  
Try to avoid very casual language (“so nothing happen,” “maybe just listen a little”). Rephrase these ideas in a more formal, academic way.

---

### Guiding Questions

- Do your sentences clearly show the process—how public actions affect government decisions?
- When you mention limitations, do you explain *why* governments do not always respond?
- Is there a logical connection from cause (citizens act) to effect (government response), and then discussion of difficulties?

---

### Revision Prompts

Let’s revise **one or two sentences at a time** for precision and flow:

#### 1. First Supporting Detail:
> “When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act.”

- Is this clear and does it connect to your topic sentence?
- Possible improvement: Could you add a phrase explaining “how” citizens demand (for example, through voting, protests, petitions)?

Would you like to revise this first supporting sentence to add a little more detail?

---

#### 2. Next, the Example Sentence:
> “For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy.”

- Is this specific and does it support your main point?  
- Can you clarify the link—what happens because of protests/voting?

Would you like to add more clarity here, or tighten the language?

---

#### 3. Limitation/Challenge Sentences:
> “But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.”

- How could you state this limitation more objectively?
- Can you mention *why* governments may not act, or barriers to citizens communicating their opinions?

Would you like to try rewriting one of these challenge sentences for more clarity and academic tone?

---

**Let’s proceed step by step:**  
Would you like to start by revising the first supporting sentence, or would you like to share a revised version of the whole paragraph first?  
If you revise one sentence, I’ll give feedback and we can continue!

Let’s keep going—what would you like to revise first?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T09:58:00.166Z

**You:** When many citizens through voting, protests, petitions to demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can cause chaotic, then push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

**Assistant:** Fantastic effort revising your first body paragraph! You’re including solid examples and explaining the effects—really well done. Now, let’s strengthen each part for clarity, precise language, and logical flow.

Let’s go **sentence by sentence**, as this is the best way to build strong academic paragraphs.

---

## 1. First Supporting Sentence

> When many citizens through voting, protests, petitions to demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act.

**Feedback:**
- The phrase “through voting, protests, petitions” needs a main verb and more formal linking—try “When many citizens demand better environmental laws through voting, protests, or petitions, governments are more likely to act.”
- This makes your subject and action clearer.

**Would you like to try rewriting this sentence for clearer grammar and a smooth structure?**

---

## 2. Second Supporting Sentence

> For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can cause chaotic, then push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy.

**Feedback:**
- "Cause chaotic" is unclear/confusing and not needed here—you can go straight to the effect.
- Make the connection more precise: “Protest or voting for environmental leaders can pressure governments to take strong actions such as banning pollution or investing in clean energy.”

**Would you like to try revising this sentence for clarity, removing "chaotic," and focusing directly on government action as a result of public pressure?**

---

## 3. Third Supporting Sentence

> In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions.

**Feedback:**
- Good concrete example!  
- You could make it more specific: For instance, “In some countries, citizens have successfully pressured leaders to introduce laws limiting plastic use or reducing carbon emissions.”

**Would you like to improve this for more detail or keep it simple?**

---

## 4. Analysis Sentence

> This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power.

**Feedback:**
- “Normal people” can be changed to “ordinary citizens” (more academic).
- You could clarify: “This shows that public opinion and pressure from ordinary citizens can be powerful, even though individual actions alone may not create change.”

**Would you like to revise for word choice and clarity?**

## 5. Limitation/Contrast Sentences

> But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

**Feedback:**
- Make this more objective/academic: “However, governments do not always respond quickly or strongly to public pressure. In addition, some citizens may want change but lack effective ways to communicate their opinions, so meaningful action does not always occur.”

**Would you like to try revising one or both of these sentences for academic tone and precision?**

**You:** I need a model example.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T10:01:39.011Z

**Assistant:** Of course! Here’s a **model example** of your revised first body paragraph, showing clear academic structure and language—but remember, this is NOT a paragraph for you to copy directly. Use it only as inspiration for your own version.

---

**Model Example:**

Citizens can most effectively address climate change by taking collective action to influence their governments' policies. When people organize protests, participate in public campaigns, or vote for leaders who prioritize the environment, they create pressure for lawmakers to introduce measures like banning pollution or investing in renewable energy. For instance, some countries have seen new laws on plastic waste or carbon emissions as a direct result of public advocacy. These examples demonstrate that ordinary citizens working together can achieve significant change, even if individual efforts alone are limited. However, government responses are not always immediate or strong; some leaders may hesitate to take serious action, and sometimes people lack the resources or channels to communicate their concerns effectively.

---

**What makes this effective:**

- **Starts with a clear main idea (linked to the topic sentence)**
- **Gives concrete examples with academic language**
- **Explains cause-and-effect relationships**
- **Discusses limitations objectively**
- **Uses formal vocabulary and sentence structure**

---

**Now, try writing your own paragraph using this as a structure guide. You can borrow sentence patterns and organization, but use your own ideas and words.**

**Assistant:** Excellent work drafting this new version of your first body paragraph! You’ve used a clear, structured approach, and your ideas are logically organized. Let’s apply the final revision step: refining for clarity, unity, and coherence, while ensuring you keep your own voice.

---

### 1. **Unity & Connection to Topic Sentence**
- Every sentence in your paragraph clearly supports the main idea: individuals have the greatest effect when they collectively influence government climate policy.

### 2. **Clarity & Academic Tone**
- Your use of phrases like “taking collective action,” “pressure for lawmakers,” and “direct result of public advocacy” sounds appropriately academic and precise.
- The examples are specific and support your argument.

### 3. **Transitions & Logical Flow**
- The flow is strong: you move from introducing the main strategy, to giving examples, to analyzing their effect, and then to discussing limitations.
- Transitions like “For instance,” “These examples demonstrate,” and “However,” help your ideas connect smoothly.

### 4. **Evidence and Explanation**
- You provide solid explanation and cause-and-effect reasoning (“...people organize protests...vote for leaders...they create pressure...”).
- Discussing both the positive outcomes and real-world limitations demonstrates depth and critical thinking.

---

#### **Guiding Revision Questions:**

- Are there any missing details, or can one example be expanded for more depth?  
- Is each sentence concise, or could any phrasing be simplified?
- Would you like to clarify why collective action is more effective than individual action, perhaps in the analysis sentence?

---

#### **Specific, Encouraging Suggestions:**

- You might strengthen your analysis sentence by specifying why “individual efforts alone are limited”—for example, large systemic change requires wide support.
- Consider replacing “ban pollution” with “enact stricter pollution controls” for more precise vocabulary.
- In the limitation, “some leaders may hesitate to take serious action”—could you add a reason (e.g., political or economic pressures)?

---

#### **Quick Prompt:**

Would you like to try revising one sentence for greater precision, such as elaborating on why collective action is powerful or clarifying one limitation?

Or, if you feel satisfied and confident in your paragraph, let me know—sometimes, it’s best not to over-revise.

---

**You’re showing clear academic growth and strong critical thinking—well done! Let me know if you’d like to make one more change or if you’re happy with your revised paragraph.**
