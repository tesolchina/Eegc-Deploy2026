            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your revised essay. You have made good progress in developing your arguments and trying to balance the roles of governments, corporations, and individuals in addressing climate change. Here are some focused suggestions to help improve clarity, coherence, and academic tone in your essay:

---

### Thesis Statement

**Current version:**
> Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I strongly believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play. Although government and corporate efforts are crucial, the contributions of individuals should not be overlooked.

**Suggestions:**
- The thesis is currently quite long and somewhat repetitive.
- It can be streamlined into one clear, academically toned sentence that previews your essay’s two main points more directly.
- For example:
> While government and corporate actions are the most critical in combating climate change, individuals also contribute meaningfully through political engagement and sustainable lifestyle choices.

This revised thesis is concise, formal, previews your two main points, and avoids first-person phrasing. Please consider adapting your thesis along these lines.

---

### Topic Sentences and Paragraph Organization

Your essay structure is generally clear, but topic sentences could more explicitly echo your thesis and foreshadow paragraph content.

- For your paragraph on influencing government, improve your topic sentence to emphasize *collective action* and *political participation*:  
  *Example:*  
  “Individuals can have the greatest impact on climate change when they unite to influence government policies through collective political engagement.”

- For your paragraph on personal lifestyle habits, make the limited but still valuable impact clearer:  
  *Example:*  
  “Although individual lifestyle changes have a smaller direct effect than government policies, they collectively shape social norms and market demand, encouraging greener business practices.”

These focused topic sentences help guide the reader and connect each paragraph with your thesis.

---

### Clarity, Grammar, and Sentence Flow

Your paragraphs contain good points but sometimes have awkward phrasing and grammar errors that interrupt the flow. Here are examples with suggestions:

- Original:  
  “But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well.”  
  Improved:  
  “However, governments may sometimes only listen partially and fail to take strong action, so efforts are not always effective.”

- Original:  
  “But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem.”  
  Improved:  
  “However, some people may be unwilling to change and prefer easier options, which limits the overall impact of individual actions.”

- Avoid fused sentences or run-ons by breaking longer sentences into clearer, simpler constructions.

---

### Logical Flow and Coherence

- After presenting the positive impact of individuals on governments and markets, clearly introduce limitations and explain why these hinder a full solution.  
- End paragraphs or sections with a summarizing sentence that connects back to the thesis and sets up the next idea.  
- Avoid abrupt topic shifts or mixing multiple ideas in one sentence.

---

### Conclusion

Your conclusion is concise and mostly effective but can be strengthened by restating the main argument more formally without first-person expressions:

- Revised example:  
  “In conclusion, while individual actions alone cannot solve climate change, they are important components of a broader effort. Citizens’ influence on governments and adoption of greener habits both contribute to environmental progress. Ultimately, collaboration among governments, corporations, and individuals is essential to address this global challenge.”

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 – Demonstrates solid understanding of the essay prompt, presents both sides, and offers thoughtful content on individual vs. government/corporate action in climate change. Some claims could be further substantiated or more nuanced.
- Organization: 20/25 – Mostly clear structure (introduction, body paragraphs, conclusion); some minor issues with flow and paragraph unity.
- Vocabulary: 19/25 – Reasonable range of vocabulary with some topic-specific language. Occasional simple word choices and minor repetitive phrasing.
- Grammar: 18/25 – Generally understandable; some grammar errors and awkward sentences impede clarity at points.
- **Original Essay Total: 78/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 22/25 – Adds nuance by clarifying individual contributions (influencing government, market signals). Attempts more complex argument, but thesis slightly wordy/unclear and some repetition remains.
- Organization: 21/25 – Paragraphing improved slightly, with some clearer topic sentences and increased attention to idea progression; some redundancies remain.
- Vocabulary: 21/25 – Greater precision (e.g., “collective pressure,” “market signals,” “political participation”) and varied phrasing; however, wordiness and run-ons are still present.
- Grammar: 19/25 – Minor improvements; fewer basic mistakes, but some sentences are still awkward or fused together.
- **Revised Essay Total: 83/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +5 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - More precise explanation of how individuals influence government and markets
  - Stronger topic sentences in body paragraphs
  - Attempted synthesis of nuanced position in thesis and throughout essay
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Thesis is still overly long and could be made more concise
  - Some paragraphs contain run-ons or fused sentences instead of clear, concise statements

---

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges:** 13
- **Conversation Quality:** The student engaged across multiple steps (thesis, topic sentence, body paragraph revision), occasionally asking clarifying questions about nuance and phrasing. Some exchanges showed willingness to try new formulations, but at times the process stalled, and critical confirmation of revisions was not always completed.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 – Moderate exchange (13 turns), with some relevant clarifying questions (e.g., about nuance in thesis statements). However, the depth of exploration and number of multi-stage questions remain limited.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 – The student asked about nuances (“how to say it is allow for some individual impact”), showed willingness to discuss phrasing, but mostly accepted guidance with limited critical challenge, and didn’t always explain choices.
- **Refining Process**: 3/5 – Stepwise attempt to revise thesis, topic sentences, and a body paragraph, but iterative back-and-forth was cut short and final confirmation of revisions was incomplete. The student did not consistently respond to “revise, then share for feedback” prompts.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 9/15**

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Demonstrated awareness of multi-step revision (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph).
- Attempted to integrate specific AI-provided language and structure into the essay.
- Engaged the AI with clarifying questions to probe academic tone and nuance.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Revision process was not fully completed—final versions of thesis statement, topic sentence, and revised paragraph were not explicitly confirmed.
- Missed opportunities for deeper, multi-cycle revision based on AI critique and stepwise feedback.
- Limited explanation or critical acceptance/rejection of AI suggestions in the chat; more meta-commentary could improve learning.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good – The student referenced original content and aims, but could have explained goal for each revision more fully each time.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement – Did not always indicate which step was being attempted; occasionally skipped or combined steps.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Developing – Some questions about phrasing/nuance, but little critical debate with the AI’s advice.
- **Independent Editing**: Developing – Incorporated suggestions, sometimes verbatim, without always confirming their fit or clarity.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing Skills:** Work on conciseness and clarity—avoid run-ons, combine related ideas, and check that your thesis is expressed in a single, strong academic sentence. Make sure each topic sentence clearly previews the body paragraph’s focus.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills:** Follow stepwise instructions fully—complete *each* revision step, explicitly confirm satisfactory changes, and explain the rationale for accepting or rejecting AI suggestions.
3. **Overall Improvement:** Seek to critically engage in the revision process by pausing to assess the logic, flow, and vocabulary of all suggested changes, and by using the AI as a “sounding board” for alternatives rather than as a simple editor.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student attempted all required steps, but did not fully complete or confirm each one (e.g., thesis statement, topic sentence, body paragraph) as separate, explicit tasks.
- The revision process shows willingness and effort, but could benefit from more systematic, iterative AI collaboration.
- Consider reviewing the structure of academic introductions and thesis statements in future lessons.
- Encourage students to use the AI as a conversation partner for reasoning, not just as a corrector. Explicit step confirmation/check-in is recommended to ensure full process completion.

---

**Progress status:**  
**NOT FINISHED:** The student has not *explicitly* completed all three tasks (thesis statement, topic sentence, and full paragraph revision) in a stepwise manner, as per instructions. Further engagement with the AI to confirm and reflect on each revision step is required.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play through political engagement and greener habits.Although government and corporate efforts are crucial, the contributions of individuals should not be overlooked.

While government and corporate actions have the greatest impact on climate change, individual choices can also contribute in meaningful ways, especially by influencing political decisions. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.Individuals have the most meaningful impact against climate change when they unite to shape government actions through collective pressure and political participation.

Beyond political engagement, individuals can further support environmental causes through personal lifestyle choices, which, while limited in direct impact, collectively shape markets and social norms. Individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of driving.Those  actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products.For example, when consumers consistently choose products from sustainable brands, it sends a powerful market signal, incentivizing businesses to adopt greener practices to meet demand and protect their reputation.But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T04:46:11.687Z

**You:** I strongly believe that individual actions are insignificant in the fight against climate change compared to the efforts of governments and large corporations

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:01:00.543Z

**Assistant:** Great, thank you for sharing your thesis statement:

> "I strongly believe that individual actions are insignificant in the fight against climate change compared to the efforts of governments and large corporations."

Let’s begin Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision

Here’s my feedback on your thesis statement:

**Strengths:**
- Confident and clear stance (“I strongly believe” shows your viewpoint).
- Focuses on the comparison between individual actions and those of governments/large corporations.

**Areas for improvement:**
- The word “insignificant” might be too strong if your essay later says individuals also “have a role to play.” Make sure your thesis matches the nuance in your argument.
- The thesis should *preview your main points/structure*—for example, briefly mention WHY government and corporate efforts are more important, or HOW individuals can still contribute.
- Try to avoid “I strongly believe” (even though you’re giving an opinion, academic essays benefit from direct language).
- Make the thesis more specific and precise, so it answers the essay question, previews your argument, and uses strong, academic vocabulary.

**Let’s rewrite the thesis:**
Would you like to try revising your thesis statement by making it:
- Direct and confident—but possibly less absolute if you want to acknowledge there’s still a smaller role for individuals?
- A preview of how you’ll compare government/corporate actions with individual ones?
- Free of “I believe/I think” phrasing?

Please write your revised thesis statement now—let me know if you need some guiding questions!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:01:12.571Z

**You:** Revise topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:05:29.739Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! You're off to a great start. Let's move forward step by step.

**Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**

Here’s a quick reminder of my earlier feedback:

- Check that your thesis matches your real opinion—does it allow for some individual impact, or is it saying only governments and companies matter?
- Be sure the thesis previews your argument/main points (for example, does it mention government influence, and the limited but still present role of individuals?).
- Try not to use “I believe/I think”—use confident, academic language.

**Guiding questions to help you revise:**
- Do you want your thesis to suggest that individuals have NO effect, or just a smaller effect compared to governments/companies?
- What are your main reasons for your opinion? (For example, “governments make laws” or “individual actions can inspire change.”)
- Can you mention both the main impact of governments/companies and the supporting but limited impact of individual actions?

**Now, please try to rewrite your thesis statement.**  
I’m here if you want to try answering any questions or get more hints—otherwise, just share your revised thesis below!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:05:36.683Z

**You:** how to say it is allow for some individual impact,

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:06:22.488Z

**Assistant:** Great question! If you want your thesis statement to **allow for some individual impact while emphasizing government and corporate responsibility**, you could use language like:

- “…although individual actions play a smaller role, they are still important…”  
or  
- “…government and corporate efforts are crucial, but the contributions of individuals should not be overlooked…”

**Guiding phrases you might use:**  
- “While government and corporate actions have the greatest impact on climate change, individual choices can also contribute in meaningful ways.”
- “Although the primary responsibility lies with governments and large corporations, individuals may still influence positive change.”

Would you like to try incorporating one of these ideas into your own thesis statement?  
Or, if you’d like some help with sentence starters or more examples, just let me know!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:06:26.655Z

**You:** Revise one body paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:08:01.441Z

**Assistant:** Wonderful! You’ve progressed through Step 1—let’s quickly confirm:  
**Please type your revised thesis statement below** (using the guidance above), and let me know if you feel satisfied with it or if you need further feedback before we move on.

**Once your thesis is finalized:**  
Next, let’s move to **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**.

**Instructions for Step 2:**
1. Please select one of your body paragraphs (either the first or second paragraph) that you’d like to revise.
2. Copy and paste the current topic sentence from that paragraph here.
3. I’ll give you focused feedback and help you make sure it strongly connects to your revised thesis.

**Ready to continue?**  
Just share your revised thesis and choose the paragraph you’d like to work on next!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:08:04.092Z

But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.Revise one body paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:09:22.354Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! We’re now on **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision.**

You’ve chosen this body paragraph and its topic sentence:

> "The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians."

Let’s review the topic sentence according to your **revised thesis statement:**
*(Please confirm your final thesis before we move forward—if you haven’t posted it, please add it here! For now, I’ll use this version based on our earlier discussion:)*  
“While government and corporate actions have the greatest impact on climate change, individual choices can also contribute in meaningful ways, especially by influencing political decisions.”

**Feedback on your topic sentence:**
- **Strengths:** It highlights the link between individual action and influencing government, which is in line with your thesis about where individuals are most effective.
- **Areas to improve:**  
    - It would be helpful to restate, even more clearly, that individuals’ main impact comes from *collective action* and *political engagement*, which aligns with your essay’s main argument.
    - Consider connecting the idea of influencing government directly to the larger effectiveness of government action, to make the thesis-topic sentence link even stronger.

**Guiding questions for revision:**
- Can you make it clear that individuals have greatest influence when acting as a group to affect government policy?
- How can you signal this paragraph will explain *why* this is the “most important way” (not just that it exists)?

**Examples of possible revisions** *(please try creating your own version first!)*:
- “Individuals have the most meaningful impact against climate change when they unite to shape government actions through collective pressure and political participation.”
- “The greatest effect individuals can have on climate change comes from working together to demand stronger environmental policies from their governments.”

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now?**  
Take the time to adjust it and post your revised version here for feedback before moving on to the rest of the paragraph!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:09:29.338Z

**You:** On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.Revise the rest of the essay

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:11:44.251Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for your detailed work and your commitment to improving your essay!  
Let’s continue with the structured revision process.

---

## Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision

Before we revise further, can you **confirm your revised thesis statement**?  
From your message, I see you’ve moved away from the absolute (“insignificant”) and want a thesis that recognizes the main impact of governments/companies, but also the role individuals can play.

Here’s a refined version **based on your progression and my earlier suggestions** (but please make sure it matches your real opinion and language style):

> While government and corporate actions have the greatest impact on climate change, individual choices can also contribute in meaningful ways, particularly through political participation and greener lifestyle habits.

**Questions for you:**
- Does this thesis confidently reflect your argument and preview your main points (government/corporate roles, and individual influence)?
- Are you happy with “individual choices can also contribute in meaningful ways, particularly through political participation and greener lifestyle habits,” or would you like to adjust that language?

**Next step:**  
**Please type and confirm your final thesis statement here.**  
(If you wish to alter the above version, feel free—just make sure it fits your voice and argument!)

---

## Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision

You’ve chosen the **second body paragraph** for revision, with the topic sentence:

> “On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.”

**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:** Clearly shifts from government/corporate actions to individual lifestyle habits.
- **Areas to improve:**  
    - The topic sentence should connect closely to your thesis—*how* do individuals contribute, and what is the impact or limitation?
    - Indicate your judgment about the effectiveness of these actions, matching your thesis’s balance (not as impactful, but still significant).

**Guiding questions:**
- Can you make it clear these are *smaller-scale* actions, but offer examples of *why they still matter* (e.g., influence companies, set examples)?
- Does the topic sentence preview how you’ll assess these actions? (Be specific about their limited, but real, influence.)

**Model approach** (but try drafting your own!):
- “Although personal lifestyle changes such as recycling or using less water are less powerful than government policies, they can still influence social norms and market demand.”
- “Beyond political engagement, individuals can support climate change solutions by adopting greener habits, which may, over time, encourage wider change.”

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence based on this feedback?**  
Please share your new version here!

## Step 3: Revising the Chosen Paragraph

Now, after updating your topic sentence, **let’s review your supporting sentences** in this body paragraph. Here’s your current draft:

> These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

**Feedback & Guiding Questions:**
- **Clarity:** Are your examples directly supporting your new topic sentence?
- **Unity:** Is each sentence linked to the idea that personal habits *can* make a difference, but have limits?
- **Coherence:** Do the sentences flow logically—from positive impact, to limitations?

**Guiding suggestions:**
- Make sure each example (creating a good example, influencing company behavior) clearly connects back to the topic sentence.
- Where you mention problems (“people just want what is easy”), can you clarify *why* this limits the impact?
- Can you connect the final assessment: is the overall effect “small but positive,” or “too limited to solve the problem alone”?

**Would you like to try revising parts of this paragraph now?**
- For example, start by rephrasing one sentence to show how people’s actions influence companies.
- Then, adjust how you explain the *limits* of this influence (what stops these actions from having a bigger impact?).
- Finally, ensure you have a sentence that ties these ideas back to your topic sentence—summarizing the overall effect.

Try rewriting one or two sentences, and I’ll give you targeted feedback—remember, don’t rewrite the whole paragraph in one go!

**You:** Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I strongly believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.Although government and corporate efforts are crucial, the contributions of individuals should not be overlooked.

While government and corporate actions have the greatest impact on climate change, individual choices can also contribute in meaningful ways, especially by influencing political decisions. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.Individuals have the most meaningful impact against climate change when they unite to shape government actions through collective pressure and political participation.

Beyond political engagement, individuals can further support environmental causes through personal lifestyle choices, which, while limited in direct impact, collectively shape markets and social norms. Individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of driving.Those  actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products.For example, when consumers consistently choose products from sustainable brands, it sends a powerful market signal, incentivizing businesses to adopt greener practices to meet demand and protect their reputation.But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.   Are there any improvement?

**Assistant:** Fantastic! You’ve done a thoughtful job revising your essay and following the three-step structure. Let’s work together to make each section as strong, clear, and connected as possible.

## Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision

**Current thesis:**  
> Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I strongly believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play. Although government and corporate efforts are crucial, the contributions of individuals should not be overlooked.

**Feedback:**

**Strengths:**  
- Shows balanced thinking—acknowledges both sides.
- Mentions the roles of both governments/companies and individuals.

**Areas for improvement:**  
- The thesis statement is currently a bit long and split between two sentences.
- Try to express your main points in a single, direct sentence that previews the essay’s argument and structure.
- Remove “I partly agree/I strongly believe” for a more academic tone.
- The phrase “personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role” is clear, but you could specify why: for example, “through political engagement and greener habits.”

**Guiding questions:**  
- Can you combine these ideas: government/corporate actions are primary, individuals contribute by influencing politics and through lifestyle?
- Can you use one confident, precise sentence?

**Would you like to try rewriting your thesis using these hints?**  
Here’s a possible structure you might adapt:
> While government and corporate actions are most critical in addressing climate change, individuals still contribute meaningfully by shaping political decisions and adopting greener lifestyle habits.

**Please post your revised thesis statement.**  
If you’re satisfied, just let me know and we’ll move on. If you want to adjust language or add more specifics, you can!

## Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision

**You chose the second body paragraph.**  
**Current topic sentence:**  
> Beyond political engagement, individuals can further support environmental causes through personal lifestyle choices, which, while limited in direct impact, collectively shape markets and social norms.

**Feedback:**

**Strengths:**  
- It introduces the paragraph’s subject: personal lifestyle choices.
- It indicates that these actions may have limited but collective influence.

**Areas for improvement:**  
- Connect even more specifically back to your thesis (for example, restate that these choices matter by affecting markets or attitudes).
- Make it clear this paragraph will evaluate both the strength and limitation of lifestyle actions.

**Guiding prompt:**  
- Can you specify *how* lifestyle choices make a difference?  
- Can you highlight that, despite the limits, their collective effect is important for social or market change?

**Would you like to try revising this topic sentence?**  
You might use a structure like:
> Although individual lifestyle changes have less direct impact than government policies, their collective influence can encourage eco-friendly business practices and inspire broader cultural shifts.

**Try adapting or improving your topic sentence—and share it here!**

## Step 3: Supporting Sentences Revision

**Lets look at your paragraph after the topic sentence:**

> These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

### Feedback and Guiding Questions

**Clarity & Unity:**  
- Your examples relate well to the topic sentence.
- Consider making each supporting point clear and linked (positive impact → limitation).

**Coherence/Flow:**  
- Start with positive effects (social influence, market signals).
- Then move to limitations (some people don’t change, insufficient overall impact).
- Finally, restate how these actions fit your thesis (helpful, but not enough alone).

**Questions to guide revision:**
- How do green habits send signals to companies? Can you make this example more specific?
- When talking about limitations, can you explain *why* so many people do not change, and how that weakens the collective impact?
- Can you close the paragraph by summarizing: “Although these actions help, they must be combined with larger-scale changes for real impact.”

**Would you like to try revising one or two sentences at a time?**  
For example:
- Refine your sentence about market signals (“For example, when many consumers choose sustainable products…”).
- Clarify your sentence about limitations (“However, if only a small number of people adopt greener lifestyles…”).
- Summarize the effect (“Therefore, while individual lifestyle changes send important signals, they cannot solve climate change without government and corporate action.”)

**Please share ONE or TWO revised sentences at a time** and I’ll help you polish and strengthen them.
