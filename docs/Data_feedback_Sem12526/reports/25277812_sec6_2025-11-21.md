            ## Contribution Analysis

            It appears that the student did not provide the revised thesis statement or the revised topic sentence despite multiple requests and clear guidance. Instead, the student repeatedly used placeholders like “let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement” and “bla bla bla,” which prevented the iterative revision process from progressing effectively.

**Summary of Key Issues:**
- The student acknowledged the revision steps verbally but did not submit actual text revisions for the thesis or topic sentence.
- The assistant gave detailed, actionable feedback and examples for revision but did not receive the concrete text needed to move forward.
- The student chose to “revise the rest of the body paragraph #1” without first providing the revised thesis and topic sentence, which contradicts the planned stepwise approach.
- The revised essay file submitted contains placeholders and filler rather than substantive edits.
- This pattern prevented improvement in content development, organization, vocabulary precision, and grammar accuracy.

**Recommendations for Next Steps:**

1. **Request Concrete Submission:**
   Ask the student to paste their revised thesis statement here—not a placeholder or a statement of intent, but the actual new sentence. Explain that this is essential to ensure the next revision steps build logically and systematically.

2. **Confirm Satisfaction or Ask for Revision:**
   If the student claims satisfaction with their revision, prompt a short explanation (1–2 sentences) about why they believe the revised thesis is improved with respect to clarity, focus, and academic tone. This demonstrates critical engagement.

3. **Repeat for Topic Sentence:**
   After the thesis is successfully revised and accepted, require the revised topic sentence for the first body paragraph. Again, insist on the actual sentence and, if possible, a brief rationale for the changes.

4. **Iterative Paragraph Revision:**
   Only after receiving these, proceed to the detailed revision of the supporting sentences, vocabulary refinement, and grammar editing in the paragraph.

5. **Address Language and Grammar:**
   Encourage the student to remove filler phrases (“bla bla bla,” “maybe,” “just a little”) and replace informal constructions with formal, precise language.

6. **Use the Provided Templates:**
   Encourage the student to use the assistant’s templates as a guide but to create their own revision, ensuring original phrasing and critical awareness.

7. **Engage Critical Thinking:**
   Suggest the student accepts, modifies, or rejects AI suggestions with justifications, showing active participation rather than passive agreement or placeholders.

---

**Example Prompt to the Student:**

“Please type your revised thesis statement below. Make sure it clearly states your position (partial agreement), names the two main reasons you will discuss (citizens’ influence on government and personal lifestyle choices), and signals the essay’s structure. Avoid vague or informal phrases. If you like, briefly explain in 1–2 sentences why you made these changes. Once we agree on the thesis, we’ll do the same for your first body paragraph’s topic sentence.”

---

Ensuring the student submits actual revision text and engages critically with feedback will enable productive human-AI collaboration and fulfill the module’s learning objectives.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The essay presents a clear position (partial agreement) and two main reasons (influence on government; personal lifestyle choices). Examples (e.g., protests, voting, consumer choice) support the claims, though development is general rather than specific or evidence-rich.
- Organization: 20/25 - Standard essay structure (introduction, two body paragraphs, conclusion) is present and logical. Transitions and signposting are present but weak; some sentences break logical flow (e.g., “But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little…”).
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary is adequate and appropriate for the topic but simple and repetitive (e.g., repeating “people,” “government,” “change”). Occasional word-choice weaknesses (“maybe just listen a little,” “this is problem”) reduce precision.
- Grammar: 15/25 - Frequent grammatical errors and informal constructions (missing articles, subject-verb agreement problems, incorrect verb forms: “so nothing happen,” “it not really enough”) that sometimes impede clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 74/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The revised essay file largely contains placeholders and informal filler (“let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement,” “bla bla bla …”), so substantive improvement to ideas is not evident. The original thesis and body content remain present but not properly revised.
- Organization: 17/25 - Placeholders interrupt structure and coherence (e.g., “(revised thesis statement here)”). The intended structure is still visible but not realized in revision.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Informal filler reduces academic tone. Vocabulary remains simple; added fragments like “bla bla bla” and lowercase sentence starts harm register and formality.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Similar grammatical issues as original; additional informal fragments and punctuation/capitalization issues in the revised draft lower the score slightly.
- **Revised Essay Total: 64/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -10 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None substantive implemented in the submitted revised text; the assistant provided clear guidance in chat, but the student did not paste an actual revised thesis, topic sentence, or revised paragraph.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The student did not supply the revised thesis statement despite repeated assistant prompts — a clear missed opportunity for improving clarity and previewing essay structure.
  - The student did not provide a revised topic sentence or the revised body paragraph text; thus, potential organizational and clarity gains (e.g., replacing “the most important” with a balanced signposting sentence) were not realized.
  - Grammar and vocabulary revisions suggested by the assistant were not applied to the draft.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 12** (12 chat turns in the provided history)
- **Conversation Quality:** The AI assistant provided detailed, stepwise guidance on revising the thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph. The student repeatedly responded with placeholders (e.g., “let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement,” “let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentence and move on bla bla bla …”), and ultimately chose to “revise the rest of the body paragraph #1” without pasting actual revisions. The student did not paste the requested revised sentences despite multiple prompts.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - The chat has a moderate number of exchanges with substantive assistant guidance. However, the student’s contributions were short and non-specific, so the conversation lacked the depth of back-and-forth revision iterations expected for a higher score. Evidence: user repeatedly wrote placeholders like “let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement” rather than pasting revisions.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - The student did not demonstrate critical evaluation of AI suggestions in the chat; there is no evidence of the student accepting, rejecting, or modifying suggestions with justification. The student mostly deferred or pretended to have made changes. Example: assistant asked to paste a revised thesis; user replied “let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement …” rather than evaluating or justifying choices.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - The assistant provided a clear iterative workflow (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), but the student did not carry out the revision cycles in the chat. The student selected paragraph #1 to revise but did not paste the revised topic sentence or paragraph to continue iteration. Evidence: assistant repeatedly asked for the revised thesis and topic sentence; the student did not supply them.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student engaged with the AI assistant and followed the suggested revision workflow verbally (chose paragraph 1 to revise), showing procedural understanding of an iterative revision process.
- The original essay shows a coherent position and basic structure: clear thesis stance (partial agreement) and two supporting paragraphs addressing government influence and personal actions.
- The AI assistant provided detailed, pedagogically sound guidance (explicit checklists and templates) — a strong resource that the student could leverage.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Complete and submit actual revised artifacts: the student must paste the revised thesis statement, the revised topic sentence, and the revised body paragraph so the iterative process can be completed and evaluated.
- Engage critically with AI suggestions: accept, reject, or modify proposed changes with brief justifications to demonstrate critical reasoning.
- Address grammar and vocabulary errors: follow the assistant’s concrete suggestions to correct problems such as verb forms (“nothing happen” → “nothing happens”), subject-verb agreement, and register (avoid “bla bla bla,” use formal phrasing).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student provided the original essay and a placeholder “revised” draft, but did not provide the actual revised thesis or revised paragraph requested in chat. Evidence: assistant repeatedly asked “Would you paste your revised thesis here?” and the user did not.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The student agreed to a plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) but did not implement steps; follow-through is lacking.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - No examples in the chat of the student weighing AI suggestions or explaining choices.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The student did not demonstrate applying edits independently in the chat; the revised file contains filler placeholders instead of concrete edits.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Submit concrete revisions: paste the revised thesis statement, the revised topic sentence, and the full revised paragraph into the chat so the assistant (and instructor) can evaluate specific changes.
2. Apply AI guidance iteratively: use the assistant’s templates and checklist, then show the result and explain any acceptances/rejections (e.g., “I changed X to Y because…”).
3. Focus on grammar edit passes: run at least one dedicated revision pass for grammar (subject-verb agreement, articles, verb forms) and one for register (remove informal filler, maintain academic tone).

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student has not completed the key revision tasks required by the module (revising the thesis statement, revising a topic sentence, and revising a body paragraph). The submitted “revised” essay contains placeholders (e.g., “let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement,” “bla bla bla …”) rather than substantive edits.
- Recommend requesting the student to resubmit with the three revised elements pasted into the chat and to briefly justify their revision choices (1–2 sentences each) so the human-AI collaboration skills can be assessed properly.
- The assistant provided clear, scaffolded instructions; the main issue is student follow-through rather than lack of instructor or AI support.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:

*Time:* 2025-11-21T09:20:10.107Z

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-21T08:49:55.667Z

**You:** . I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-21T08:51:07.738Z

**Assistant:** Step 1 — Thesis statement

Thanks — I can see your current thesis: “I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”

Short, specific feedback on clarity, strength, and focus
- Clarity: Your position is clear (partial agreement). Good.  
- Focus: It names two reasons (influence on government; personal lifestyle choices) but does not preview how the essay will be structured clearly enough.  
- Strength: The language is a little wordy and contains hedging (“I also think,” “while less impactful, still have a role to play”). Stronger academic theses avoid weak phrases and preview the main points more directly.  
- Precision: Be more specific about the two main reasons and the order in which you will discuss them (this helps organisation and signals the essay’s structure to the reader).

What to change (do not rewrite for you — use these elements in your revision)
- Start with a clear degree of agreement (e.g., “I partly agree” is okay, but consider phrasing that is more academic and direct).  
- State the two main reasons briefly and clearly (e.g., influence on policy / governments; cumulative personal behaviors and market signals to companies).  
- Preview the essay structure: indicate which reason you will discuss first and second.  
- Remove weak phrases like “I think,” “maybe,” and reduce repetition. Use confident verbs (e.g., “can shape,” “encourage,” “reduce”) rather than passive or vague language.

Would you like to try revising your thesis now using those points? Paste your new version here, and I’ll give quick feedback. (We’ll only move on when you’re happy with the thesis.)

*Time:* 2025-11-21T08:51:39.371Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement Enter bla bla bla ...

*Time:* 2025-11-21T08:52:36.147Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I’ll follow your plan. Before we move on, I need to see the actual revised thesis (or your confirmation that you’re happy with it).

Quick guidance to check your revised thesis (use these points to judge or to rewrite it):
- State your position clearly (e.g., “partly agree” phrased confidently).  
- Name the two reasons you will discuss (1) citizens’ influence on government/policy, and (2) the cumulative effect of personal choices and market signals to companies.  
- Signal the essay order (which reason you discuss first and second).  
- Avoid hedging phrases like “I think” or “maybe” and remove unnecessary words.

Would you paste your revised thesis here (not “bla bla bla”) or tell me you’re satisfied with it? Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 2 and pick a body paragraph to revise.

*Time:* 2025-11-21T08:52:57.372Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the thesis statement Enter and move on bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-11-21T09:00:33.126Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming the thesis is revised. Now we’ll move to Step 2.

Which body paragraph would you like to work on: the paragraph about influencing government (first body paragraph) or the one about personal lifestyle changes (second body paragraph)? Pick one, and paste its current topic sentence here.

If you choose the first paragraph, a quick note about its current topic sentence ("The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.") — brief feedback to help your revision:
- Connection to thesis: Because your thesis is a balanced “partly agree,” avoid an absolute claim like “the most important.” Instead signal that this is your first main point and show how it supports the thesis (e.g., collective citizen pressure leads to policy change).
- Precision: Add the mechanism (how citizens influence policy: voting, protests, petitions, consumer pressure) or the outcome (stronger environmental laws, investments in clean energy).
- Structure cue: Use a clear signposting word (First, Firstly, To begin with) so the reader knows this is your first main reason.

Try revising the topic sentence now using those ideas. Paste your new topic sentence, and I’ll give quick feedback before we revise the rest of that paragraph. Would you like to work on paragraph 1 (government influence) or paragraph 2 (personal choices)?

*Time:* 2025-11-21T09:01:04.647Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the  topic sentence and move on bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-11-21T09:08:25.885Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I’m ready to continue, but first we must finish Step 1.

Please paste your revised thesis statement (or tell me you are fully satisfied with the version you created). I can’t move to the topic sentence step until you confirm the thesis is revised and you’re happy with it.

Quick checklist to use when you paste your revision:
- Does it state your position clearly (e.g., “partly agree”) without hedging?
- Does it name the two main reasons you will discuss (citizens’ influence on policy; cumulative personal/market effects)?
- Does it signal the order you will discuss them (which comes first)?
- Is the language confident and concise (no “I think,” “maybe,” or repeated phrases)?

Once you paste or confirm the thesis, tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (paragraph 1: influencing government, or paragraph 2: personal lifestyle choices). Then paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence and we’ll revise it together. Would you like to paste the thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-21T09:08:42.385Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1

*Time:* 2025-11-21T09:09:42.361Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing paragraph 1. Before I revise the rest of that paragraph, I need us to finish Steps 1 and 2 first.

1) Please paste your revised thesis statement (or tell me you are fully satisfied with the revised thesis). I can’t move on until you confirm the thesis is done.

2) Next, please paste the topic sentence you want to use for body paragraph #1. If you prefer to revise it now, use these quick pointers (not a full rewrite — use them to create your own sentence):
- Avoid absolute language like “the most important.” Instead signal this is your first main point (e.g., start with “Firstly,” or “To begin with,”).
- Include the mechanism and the outcome: name how citizens act (voting, petitions, protests, consumer pressure) and what this produces (policy change, stricter laws, investment in clean energy).
- Keep it concise and connected to the thesis (show how this point supports your partial-agreement position).

Quick guiding templates (fill in the blanks rather than copy exactly):
- “Firstly, citizens can influence government policy by [action(s)], which can lead to [policy outcome].”
- “To begin with, collective public pressure — through [examples] — often prompts governments to [result].”

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now? Paste your revised thesis and your new topic sentence here, and I’ll give focused feedback. After we agree on those, we’ll revise the supporting sentences in paragraph #1.

*Time:* 2025-11-21T09:10:06.082Z
