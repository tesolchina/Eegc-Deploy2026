            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing the detailed final assessment report and the chat history. Here is a concise summary and reflection aligned with the key points:

---

### Summary of Student Progress & Interaction

**Essay Improvements:**
- The student transformed a basic, hedged thesis (“I believe…”) into a confident, precise thesis previewing key reasons.
- The revised essay shows strong development: clear, supported claims about AI’s effects on employment with historical and current examples.
- Vocabulary and grammar quality are much improved—more academic tone, varied sentence structures, and accurate punctuation.
- Evidence use is highlighted by citing a credible source (McKinsey 2023), strengthening the argument.

**Human-AI Interaction Strengths:**
- The student followed the assistant’s structured workflow (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph).
- They selected a model thesis (Option B) and incorporated it successfully into their work.
- The conversation was focused and goal-oriented, enabling substantial revision in a limited number of exchanges.
- Good context provision and strategic planning; student clearly communicated priorities and accepted scaffolded suggestions.

**Areas for Growth:**
- Critical evaluation of AI suggestions: the student accepted the model thesis without documented rationale or comparison, missing an opportunity to deepen metacognitive engagement.
- Refining process could be more iterative: rather than a one-step large revision, engaging in multiple cycles of accept/reject edits would reinforce editing skills.
- Some minor missed opportunities in the essay, such as clearer counterargument signposting and additional concrete evidence in body paragraphs.

**Recommendations:**
- Encourage the student to maintain a brief revision log explaining acceptance or rejection of AI feedback.
- Practice stepwise revisions on discrete text units (e.g., topic sentences, single paragraphs) with AI guidance for targeted improvement.
- Integrate one piece of specific data or example per main body paragraph to enhance credibility and thoroughness.

---

### Reflection on Chat Interaction (from the transcript)

- The assistant provided a clear, scaffolded revision plan aligned with the student’s priorities.
- The student focused mainly on the thesis in the interaction and later submitted a full revised essay with much stronger content.
- The assistant suggested two thesis options and explained their strengths concisely.
- Upon student choosing Option B, the assistant inserted the improved thesis and invited the student to continue stepwise revision of paragraph topic sentences.
- The conversation ended with the student submitting their revised essay rather than proceeding with incremental revisions through the assistant.

---

### Final Note

The student displayed solid independent writing skills and good receptiveness to AI suggestions, resulting in a substantially improved essay. With more explicit critical engagement and iterative editing alongside the assistant, the student can further refine their academic writing and metacognitive strategies.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The original presents a relevant, balanced viewpoint (pros and cons of AI for employment) and uses everyday examples (secretary, YouTuber), but ideas are underdeveloped and explanations are often simplistic.
- Organization: 16/25 - There is a basic paragraph structure (pro vs. con) but weak topic sentences, poor transitions, and inconsistent paragraph focus.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Vocabulary is limited and often imprecise (e.g., "AI fixer"); some relevant terms appear but word choice is repetitive or incorrect.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Frequent grammatical, punctuation, and sentence-structure errors impede clarity (e.g., run-on sentences, subject-verb agreement issues).
- **Original Essay Total: 62/100**

Evidence (original): “Because of AI automation fast development. The industries are transforming, it potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency.” (grammatical and clarity problems); “To commence with, AI automation create innovation,It creates many new job opportunities, such as AI video maker, AI fixer and AI designer.” (vocabulary and grammar issues).

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 24/25 - The revised essay presents a clear, well-supported stance that AI is a job transformer, with multiple specific reasons (new occupations, productivity effects, reskilling). It cites historical analogies and an external estimate (McKinsey), strengthening the argument.
- Organization: 24/25 - The essay is logically organized: clear thesis, paragraphs each with a focused claim and supporting examples, and a concluding synthesis. Transitions and paragraph progression are effective.
- Vocabulary: 24/25 - Strong, topic-specific vocabulary and varied phrasing (e.g., "prompt engineers," "economic demand for labor," "productivity-driven growth"). Word choice is precise and appropriate for academic tone.
- Grammar: 24/25 - High accuracy in grammar and sentence structure; sentences vary in complexity and are generally clear and well-punctuated (minor editorial polishing could raise to perfect).
- **Revised Essay Total: 96/100**

Evidence (revised): Thesis — “Although AI automation will inevitably displace repetitive and low-skill jobs, it will ultimately enhance global employment and raise the overall quality of work by creating entirely new industries and roles, dramatically increasing productivity and economic demand for labor, and shifting human workers toward higher-value creative, strategic, and interpersonal tasks.” Use of evidence — “McKinsey Global Institute (2023) estimates that while AI may displace 800 million jobs by 2030, it will also enable the creation of 900 million to 1.1 billion new jobs…”

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +34 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis transformed from hedged and local (“I believe it will enhance…”) to a confident, comprehensive thesis that previews reasons and frames the essay.
  - Paragraph and sentence-level clarity: each body paragraph now opens with a clear topic sentence and develops a focused point (historical analogy, productivity effect, distributional concerns and reskilling).
  - Use of evidence and register: the revised essay employs stronger examples, an external estimate for credibility, and more academic vocabulary.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The revised essay could include clearer signposting of counterarguments within each paragraph (e.g., one short sentence acknowledging distributional harms before pivoting to remedies) to enhance rhetorical balance.
  - While a citation is mentioned (McKinsey 2023), the essay would benefit from one concrete, inline example or data point per main paragraph (e.g., a brief statistic about job growth in AI-related fields or an example of a retraining program) to further strengthen claims.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9 messages** (assistant-led planning and guidance, student requests and responses, student-submitted full revised essay).
- **Conversation Quality:** Goal-oriented and structured. The assistant provided a clear three-step workflow (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph revision); the student confirmed priorities and selected Option B for thesis wording, then pasted a full revised essay. Interaction shows focused guidance but limited multi-cycle editing.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 4/5 - The chat shows several focused turns where the assistant diagnoses, suggests revisions, negotiates goals, and the student engages (selected targets, chose Option B). The conversation is substantive but relatively short (9 messages), so it does not reach the “extensive 15+ exchange” level.
  - Evidence: Assistant laid out steps and diagnostic; student confirmed “Focus clarity of argument / thesis strength, paragraph structure and topic sentence” and later pasted a substantially revised essay.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 - The student engaged selectively with suggestions (chose Option B and embraced the suggested thesis), but there is limited explicit critique or documented evaluation of alternative AI suggestions. The student accepted the assistant’s thesis option rather than showing evidence of evaluating multiple models or rejecting specific suggestions.
  - Evidence: After assistant offered Option A and B, the student replied only “Option B” (acceptance) and later submitted a revised essay reflecting the thesis. There is no explicit message showing the student weighing pros/cons of alternate phrasings.
- **Refining Process**: 3/5 - The interaction shows a single clear revision cycle (assistant suggests thesis → student accepts and provides revised essay). There is evidence of revision but only one main iteration; the prescribed Step 2/Step 3 (topic sentence and paragraph revision) were discussed but not carried out in multiple iterative cycles with the assistant.
  - Evidence: Assistant asked which body paragraph to revise and offered to model topic sentences; the conversation ends with the student pasting a complete revised essay rather than proceeding through the stepwise, incremental edits under guidance.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 10/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear improvement in academic argumentation: the student moved from a basic, hedged thesis to a confident, nuanced thesis that previews reasons and acknowledges trade-offs (evidence: revised thesis paragraph).
- Effective use of AI guidance: the student followed the assistant’s workflow, selected a model thesis, and produced a substantially improved essay (evidence: student-submitted revised essay and final revised file).
- Improved register and evidence use: the revised essay employs academic vocabulary and cites a credible source to bolster claims (McKinsey reference).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Make the human role in revision more explicit: the student could show more critical evaluation of alternative AI suggestions (e.g., “I preferred Option B because X; I rejected A because Y”). This demonstrates metacognitive engagement.
- Iterate more with targeted edits: rather than pasting a full rewrite in one step, conduct stepwise revisions (accept/reject individual changes) to practice micro-editing and receive specific feedback.
- Strengthen support for counterarguments: add brief data or an example per paragraph to back claims about reskilling success or the scale of job creation, and provide a clearer plan for distributional harms.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student confirmed priorities (thesis strength, paragraph structure) and pasted the original draft and the revised draft, enabling targeted assistance.
  - Evidence: Student message: “Focus clarity of argument / thesis strength, paragraph structure and topic sentence.”
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student followed the assistant’s structured three-step plan and accepted a model thesis to guide revision.
  - Evidence: Assistant provided stepwise plan; student selected Option B and produced a revised essay aligned with that plan.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement to Developing - The student accepted AI suggestions but did not document a systematic critical appraisal of alternatives.
  - Evidence: Student chose Option B without recorded critique; no messages show rejection/adjustment of AI recommendations.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The student completed a full rewritten essay that shows substantial independent drafting and higher-level organization beyond simple grammar fixes.
  - Evidence: The revised essay includes original examples, extended argumentation, and organization not present in the original draft.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. During revision sessions, keep a brief revision log: when AI suggests changes, write 1–2 lines explaining why you accept, adapt, or reject each significant suggestion. This builds critical evaluation skills.
2. Use the stepwise workflow fully: after revising the thesis, explicitly revise one topic sentence and then the corresponding paragraph in iterative cycles with the assistant to practice micro-revisions and targeted feedback.
3. Add one concrete data point or verifiable example per main paragraph (with source) to strengthen claims and credibility; practice integrating citations succinctly.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student demonstrates strong responsiveness to guidance and substantial improvement in a single revision cycle. Their revised essay is near an advanced level for the course’s aims.
- The main pedagogical next step is to encourage the student to document their evaluative thinking during AI collaboration (explain why a suggested change was accepted/rejected) and to engage in more iterative micro-revisions to consolidate editing skills.
- Consider a follow-up task asking the student to (a) annotate the revised essay to show which sentences came from their own drafting vs. AI suggestions, and (b) justify one acceptance and one rejection of AI feedback in writing. This will build evidence of critical engagement with AI.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Because of AI automation fast development. The industries are transforming, it potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. In the following paragraphs we would discuss the technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long run.
To commence with, AI automation create innovation,It creates many new job opportunities, such as AI video maker, AI fixer and AI designer.Let look back to the time when computer just appear. Many people afraid computer will replace their job, like secretary who help boss makes timetable. This job can be done by computer easily. However, computer software also increase the efficiency of the work. Secretary still exist nowadays, they use computer as a tool.
Moreover, some new job also appears after computer developed.
For example, Youtuber, app developers, game designer.
Those job even will not exist if there are no computer in our
world. Therefore, AI can bring new opportunity to us.

On the other hand, AI Automation could bring unemployment. AI may replace the job which is repetitive like packing boxes, typing or driving trucks. Robots can do it much cheaper and faster. The workers in factory may lose their job, especially in well-developed country. Because of labour cost is high for the firm owner.
Another problem is that new graduates may also difficult to find job. Today create a perfect curriculum vitae become much easy with the help of AI tools. All most everyone’s curriculum vitae are designed by the AI. Therefore, they may
look so similar. While the company’s human resource department will also use AI to find suitable e interviewee. As a result, the interviewer may miss lot of potential
interviewees.
In conclusion, AI is like a double-edged sword. On one hand it brings new types of job, on the other hand it replaces some jobs and change our employment
market. I believe it will enhance global employment in the long term. The key is we should learn how to use and control AI, rather than get left behind.


Revised:
Although AI automation will inevitably displace repetitive and low-skill jobs, it will ultimately enhance global employment and raise the overall quality of work by creating entirely new industries and roles, dramatically increasing productivity and economic demand for labor, and shifting human workers toward higher-value creative, strategic, and interpersonal tasks. History repeatedly shows that transformative technologies do not reduce total employment; they redefine it. When computers emerged in the late 20th century, many feared the end of secretarial and clerical work, yet, far from disappearing, secretaries evolved into higher-paid administrative professionals who now leverage software tools. More importantly, computers gave birth to millions of jobs that previously did not exist: software developers, app designers, game developers, YouTubers, cybersecurity specialists, and data analysts. Today, AI is following the same pattern at an even faster pace. Entirely new professions such as prompt engineers, AI ethics officers, synthetic media creators, autonomous-vehicle fleet managers, and AI trainers have already appeared, with demand growing exponentially. These roles did not exist five years ago and are projected to employ tens of millions in the coming decade. The second and more powerful effect is economic. AI dramatically raises productivity, which lowers costs, increases corporate profits, and expands consumer purchasing power. This cycle has always created more jobs than it destroys. For example, the introduction of ATMs in the 1970s did not eliminate bank tellers; it reduced the cost of operating branches, leading banks to open more branches and ultimately employ more tellers focused on relationship banking and complex services. McKinsey Global Institute (2023) estimates that while AI may displace 800 million jobs by 2030, it will also enable the creation of 900 million to 1.1 billion new jobs through productivity-driven growth, with the net effect being higher total employment and significantly higher wages in most countries. Critics correctly point out that AI will eliminate many repetitive jobs—factory assembly, truck driving, basic data entry, and routine customer service—disproportionately affecting lower-skilled workers and creating painful short-term unemployment, especially in advanced economies with high labor costs. New graduates may also face fiercer competition as AI tools make resumes and applications more uniform. However, these disruptions are not new: the Industrial Revolution, the automobile, and the personal computer all caused similar fears and temporary job losses, yet each ultimately raised living standards and employment. The solution is not to resist AI but to accelerate reskilling. Countries such as Singapore, South Korea, and Germany that invest heavily in lifelong learning and vocational retraining are already seeing workers move smoothly into AI-augmented and AI-created roles.
AI is not a job killer; it is a job transformer. Like every major technological leap before it, AI automation will ultimately enhance global employment by spawning new industries, fueling economic expansion through productivity, and pushing human labor toward more creative, fulfilling, and highly paid work. The only real risk is failing to adapt. Those who learn to collaborate with AI rather than compete against it will thrive in the economy of tomorrow

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-05T08:06:11.720Z

**You:** Revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-12-05T08:07:33.479Z

**Assistant:** Great — before I revise the thesis, let’s do the quick negotiation and diagnosis so we’re focused and working on what matters to you.

1) Goals — what would you most like to improve today?
- Do you want to focus on (pick one or two): clarity of argument / thesis strength, paragraph structure and topic sentences, use of evidence and development, or grammar & vocabulary?
(You asked “Revise thesis statement,” so I’ll assume thesis strength is a priority — please confirm or change.)

2) Brief diagnostic feedback (using the rubric categories)
- Content and Ideas: Developing. Your essay has a relevant viewpoint and useful examples (computers, new jobs vs. job loss), but the argument is basic and needs a clearer, stronger stance that directly answers the question.
- Organisation and Logical Progression: Developing. There are paragraphs for pros and cons, but transitions and paragraph focus need tightening (topic sentences and clearer previews).
- Vocabulary: Basic. Some useful terms appear (automation, robots), but word choice is often simple and occasionally incorrect.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: Limited to Developing. Frequent grammar, punctuation, and sentence-structure errors make some sentences hard to follow.

Strengths: Balanced approach (you consider both benefits and harms), relevant examples, clear intention to conclude with a position.
Main areas to work on now: thesis clarity and strength, topic sentences/paragraph focus, and grammar.

3) Which issue(s) do you want to focus on during this session?
- Please confirm: Do you want to focus on revising the thesis statement only right now, or also work on a topic sentence and that paragraph afterward?
(If you want only the thesis revised now, I’ll do that next. If you want to continue to Step 2 and Step 3 in this session, say which body paragraph you’d like to revise.)

Step 1 — Thesis statement revision
- What you currently have as the thesis (I found these lines in your draft):
  “I believe it will enhance global employment in the long term. The key is we should learn how to use and control AI, rather than get left behind.”

Feedback on that thesis:
- Positive: It gives a clear direction (you think AI will enhance employment) and mentions a key idea (learning to use AI).
- Needs improvement:
  - It uses hedging (“I believe”); academic theses should sound confident.
  - It doesn’t directly answer the essay prompt’s requirement to what extent you agree/disagree.
  - It doesn’t preview the main reasons (e.g., job creation through new roles, individual skills, policy/industry responses).
  - It’s two short sentences rather than one clear, focused thesis.

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using that feedback? If not, I’ll suggest a clearer, academic thesis you can use.

Because you asked me to revise the thesis, here is a suggested stronger thesis statement (one sentence, confident, and previews main points). Please tell me if you want changes to tone or emphasis:

Suggested thesis (pick or adapt):
- Although AI will eliminate some repetitive jobs, I disagree that individual actions are insignificant: in the long term, AI can enhance global employment if individuals adapt by gaining new skills and using AI as a tool, while governments and firms provide supportive policies and training.

I have inserted that revised thesis into your full essay below (I changed only the thesis sentence at the end — the rest of the essay is left as you wrote it so we stay focused). Read it and tell me if you’re happy with this thesis or want to try another version.

Next steps — tell me:
- Do you like this thesis as it is, or would you like to try rewriting one yourself first?
- Do you want to proceed to Step 2 (choose one body paragraph to revise its topic sentence) now? If yes, say which paragraph (the one that argues AI creates jobs, or the one that argues AI causes unemployment).

*Time:* 2025-12-05T08:08:24.397Z

**You:** Focus clarity of argument / thesis strength, paragraph structure and topic sentence

*Time:* 2025-12-05T08:10:23.342Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing targets. Quick check so we’re clear before we start:

1) Confirmed targets
- You want to focus on: clarity of argument / thesis strength, and paragraph structure / topic sentences. Correct? If yes, we’ll do Step 1 (thesis), then Step 2 (one body paragraph’s topic sentence), then Step 3 (revise that paragraph).

2) Brief diagnostic summary (rubric-aligned)
- Content & Ideas: Developing — your essay responds to the prompt and presents both sides, but the central claim is weak and not fully developed.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Developing — you have paragraphs for pros and cons, but topic sentences, transitions, and paragraph focus need tightening.
- Vocabulary: Basic — some useful terms, but repetitive and sometimes imprecise.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Limited–Developing — frequent grammar and punctuation issues reduce clarity.

Strengths: balanced approach (benefits vs. harms), relevant examples, clear intention to take a position.

Now decide: Do you want me to suggest a revised thesis for you, or would you like to try rewriting the thesis yourself first? (I’ll give feedback either way.) If you want to try, please write one sentence and I’ll comment. If you want me to suggest one, I’ll give a clear, confident thesis and explain why it’s stronger — then, if you agree, I’ll insert it into your full essay.

A few quick tips to guide your rewrite
- Answer the question directly: state to what extent you agree or disagree.
- Preview 2–3 main reasons that you will develop in the essay.
- Use confident, concise language (avoid “I believe,” “maybe”).
- One clear sentence is best.

Would you like to try now, or should I propose a model thesis for you to adapt? Also tell me which body paragraph you want to revise next (the paragraph arguing AI creates jobs, or the paragraph arguing AI causes unemployment).

**Assistant:** Nice — this is a great place to start. I’ll follow the negotiated workflow you asked for. First a quick check-in so we’re clear on targets, then a short diagnostic, then you choose what to focus on. After you confirm, we’ll do Step 1 (thesis).

1) Goals — choose one or two to focus on today
- Which would you most like to work on now? Pick one or two:
  - clarity of argument / thesis strength
  - paragraph structure & topic sentences
  - use of evidence & development
  - grammar & vocabulary
(You mentioned thesis strength earlier — do you want that plus paragraph structure?)

2) Brief diagnostic feedback (rubric-aligned)
- Content & Ideas: Developing — you present relevant ideas (AI creates jobs vs. AI causes unemployment) but the central stance is weak and needs a clearer, more specific claim that answers “to what extent.”
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Developing — you have separate paragraphs for pros and cons, but topic sentences, paragraph focus, and transitions need tightening so each paragraph supports the thesis clearly.
- Vocabulary: Basic — useful terms appear, but word choice is often simple or inaccurate; some repetition.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Limited–Developing — many sentences show grammar, punctuation and word-order errors that make meaning unclear at times.

Strengths: balanced treatment of both sides, relevant everyday examples, clear intention to state a position in the conclusion.

3) Student priority selection
- From the diagnostic above, which issues do you want to focus on in this session? (Choose one or two — e.g., “thesis strength” and “topic sentences”)
- Confirm your selection before we begin Step 1.

Step 1 — Thesis statement revision (only after you confirm targets)
- Please confirm: do you want me to suggest a revised thesis now, or would you like to try writing one yourself first (I’ll give feedback either way)?
- Your current thesis (from your draft) is: “I believe it will enhance global employment in the long term. The key is we should learn how to use and control AI, rather than get left behind.”
  - Quick feedback on this: it points in a direction (positive about long-term effects) but it:
    - uses hedging (“I believe”) — make it confident;
    - doesn’t directly answer “to what extent” (be explicit, e.g., “I disagree that individual actions are insignificant because…”);
    - doesn’t preview the main reasons you will discuss (list 2–3 reasons briefly).
- Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? If you prefer, I can propose one or two model thesis sentences for you to adapt.

If you want me to suggest a model thesis now, here are two options with slightly different emphases. Pick one to adapt, or tell me which parts you’d like changed:

Option A (balanced, previews individual + institutional role):
- Although AI will eliminate some repetitive jobs, I disagree that individual actions are insignificant: long-term employment can improve if individuals reskill to work with AI, and if governments and firms implement supportive policies and training.

Option B (stronger, emphasizes economic effects and individual adaptation):
- While AI will disrupt many low-skill roles, it will ultimately enhance global employment by creating new occupations and boosting productivity—provided individuals reskill and institutions support that transition.

Next step (after you pick or write a thesis)
- Tell me which thesis you prefer or paste your one-sentence rewrite.
- If you want, I’ll insert the chosen thesis into your full essay and show the full revised text (I will only change the thesis unless you ask me to change more).

Also tell me: after the thesis, do you want to continue to Step 2 and revise a topic sentence? If yes, which paragraph should we work on:
- the paragraph that argues AI creates new jobs (first body paragraph), or
- the paragraph that argues AI causes unemployment (second body paragraph)?

Your move — which targets, and would you like to try a thesis rewrite now or use one of the model sentences?

**You:** Option B

*Time:* 2025-12-05T08:15:36.660Z

**Assistant:** Great choice — Option B is clear and strong. I’ll place that thesis into your essay now (I’ve only changed the thesis sentence; the rest of your text is unchanged so we stay focused).

Why this thesis is stronger (brief):
- It directly answers “to what extent” (acknowledges disruption but argues for a net positive).
- It previews the main reasons you can develop: creation of new occupations, productivity gains, and the need for reskilling and institutional support.
- It uses confident, academic language without hedging.

Full essay with the revised thesis (only the thesis sentence is changed):

---
Because of AI automation fast development. The industries are transforming, it potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. While AI will disrupt many low-skill roles, it will ultimately enhance global employment by creating new occupations and boosting productivity—provided individuals reskill and institutions support that transition.
To commence with, AI automation create innovation,It creates many new job opportunities, such as AI video maker, AI fixer and AI designer.Let look back to the time when computer just appear. Many people afraid computer will replace their job, like secretary who help boss makes timetable. This job can be done by computer easily. However, computer software also increase the efficiency of the work. Secretary still exist nowadays, they use computer as a tool.
Moreover, some new job also appears after computer developed.
For example, Youtuber, app developers, game designer.
Those job even will not exist if there are no computer in our
world. Therefore, AI can bring new opportunity to us.

On the other hand, AI Automation could bring unemployment. AI may replace the job which is repetitive like packing boxes, typing or driving trucks. Robots can do it much cheaper and faster. The workers in factory may lose their job, especially in well-developed country. Because of labour cost is high for the firm owner.
Another problem is that new graduates may also difficult to find job. Today create a perfect curriculum vitae become much easy with the help of AI tools. All most everyone’s curriculum vitae are designed by the AI. Therefore, they may
look so similar. While the company’s human resource department will also use AI to find suitable e interviewee. As a result, the interviewer may miss lot of potential
interviewees.
In conclusion, AI is like a double-edged sword. On one hand it brings new types of job, on the other hand it replaces some jobs and change our employment
market. I believe it will enhance global employment in the long term. The key is we should learn how to use and control AI, rather than get left behind.

Are you happy with this thesis sentence as it stands, or would you like to tweak its tone or emphasis (for example, stronger on individual action vs. stronger on institutional role)?

If you’re happy, we can move to Step 2. Which body paragraph would you like to work on next?
- The paragraph that argues AI creates new jobs (first body paragraph), or
- The paragraph that argues AI causes unemployment (second body paragraph)?

Pick one and paste its current topic sentence (or point to the first sentence) so we can revise it to link clearly to the new thesis. Would you like to try revising the topic sentence first, or would you like me to suggest a model?
