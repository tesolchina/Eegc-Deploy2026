            ## Contribution Analysis

            Your conclusion is quite clear and mostly well structured. Here is an improved version with corrections to grammar, article use, plural forms, and style for a more formal and polished academic tone:

---

**Polished Revision:**

> In summary, AI automation may replace many jobs in the short term. However, in the long term, some positions in certain industries cannot be replaced by AI automation, and more jobs will be created as a result of AI. Therefore, AI automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.

---

**Optional More Academic Version:**

> In summary, although AI automation may replace many jobs in the short term, some positions in certain industries will remain irreplaceable, and new jobs will be created as a result of advances in AI. Therefore, AI automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
AI automation has boosted efficiency in the production processes of different industries.This has caused an increase in the number of unemployed people because AI automation is more cost-effective than employing humans.However, AI automation will ultimately improve global employment prospects in the long term because there are many industries where humans cannot be completely replaced, and the development of AI will create new job opportunities.

Firstly,  in many industries, AI cannot completely replace human jobs. For example , in the healthcare field , AI automation can help diagnose diseases and recommend suitable treatment quickly. Yes , it seems when AI is compared to human doctor , its efficiency is much higher. However, nowadays, AI technology is only about 90% accurate, which is not acceptable in the healthcare field. If it is not 100% correct , there may be misdiagnosed cases ,which can lead to patients continuing to suffer. Therefore , a human doctor must still be present. AI automation can be a tool to improve efficiency , but the final judgement should be made by human to avoid possible medical accidents. To sum up , it is not suitable for automation to replace all job in the long term.

Secondly , AI automation will create many new job opportunities in the long term. While workers are being laid off in the short term , they will find new ways to adapt. For example , some may start their own businesses, which creates more job opportunities in the labour market. However, these are only a few cases , many workers still lose their jobs while the global labour market cannot provide enough jobs for everyone. Therefore we should look further, to see what value AI can create in the future. Imagine in the future, perhaps 60% of current jobs will be replaced by AI automation. However , new jobs could be created like AI security , AI manager and AI protector. New industries related to AI will be developed which will provide more jobs to the global labour market.It is even estimated that in the future , AI will bring many more job opportunities than there are today. Therefore , AI automation will enhance global employment in the long term.

In conclusion, AI automation may replace many job position in the short term. However, in the long term, some positions in certain industries cannot be replaced by AI automation, and more jobs will be created because of AI. Therefore, AI automation will ultimately enhance the global employment prospects in the long term.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-19T05:26:32.997Z

**You:** Revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-19T05:42:34.933Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let's begin with the **Preliminary Stage** before we revise your thesis.

---

## Preliminary Stage: Negotiating Targets and Diagnosing the Essay

### 1. **Negotiate Targets**
Before we start revising your thesis, can you tell me:
- What are your main goals for this essay?  
  (For example: Do you want to focus more on making your argument stronger, improving clarity, organizing your ideas better, upgrading your vocabulary, or correcting grammar and sentence structure?)

### 2. **Diagnostic Feedback (Based on the Rubric)**

Let me briefly review your draft using the provided rubric:

#### **Content and Ideas**
- **Strength:** You have a clear main argument: that AI automation will ultimately improve global employment in the long term.
- **Area to Improve:** Some points are repetitive or vague. The explanation needs more depth and clearer development of ideas.

#### **Organization and Logical Progression**
- **Strength:** You use paragraphing and have some logical order (introduction, body paragraphs, conclusion).
- **Area to Improve:** Paragraphs can be better linked to each other; topic sentences and transitions need work for a smoother flow.

#### **Vocabulary**
- **Strength:** You make some attempts with academic and topic-specific vocabulary (e.g., "automation," "AI," "labour market").
- **Area to Improve:** There are issues with word choice, repetition, and errors ("cost-saved," "job position" instead of "jobs"/"positions").

#### **Grammar and Sentence Structure**
- **Strength:** Basic sentence structure is mostly understandable.
- **Area to Improve:** There are many grammar errors (tense, agreement, article use). Some sentences are confusing or incomplete.

---

### 3. **Student Priority Selection**
Now, based on my feedback:
- Which area would you like us to focus on mostly in this session?
  - **Thesis/Argument Clarity**
  - **Structure and Organization**
  - **Vocabulary and Word Choice**
  - **Grammar and Sentence Structure**

**Please tell me your main focus before we start Step 1.**

---

#### Once you tell me your priority, we'll move to revising your thesis statement together!

*Time:* 2025-11-19T05:42:41.540Z

**You:** Grammar and Sentence Structure

*Time:* 2025-11-19T05:45:05.949Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your main focus: **Grammar and Sentence Structure**.

That's a great choice, as stronger grammar and clear sentence structure will help make your ideas more persuasive and easier for your reader to follow. We will keep this as our top priority throughout the revision steps. If you ever want small help with vocabulary or organization, just say so!

---

## Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision

**Your current thesis statement:**  
> However, I think this technology shift ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term. There were a lots of industries that AI can’t completely replace human, and the development of AI may creates more job position.

Let's review this for grammar, clarity, and precision:

### Feedback:
- "I think" could be stronger (let’s state the argument confidently).
- "enhance" needs to agree with "shift" ("shift...enhances").
- "There were a lots of industries..." — tense/structure issues.  
- "may creates" — verb form error.
- Sentences could combine for smoother structure.

Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now with these suggestions?
- Make the verb forms correct.
- Be confident—remove hedging ("I think").
- State your position clearly, summarizing the main points.

**(Let me know your revised thesis, or type "help" if you'd like an example)**

*Time:* 2025-11-19T05:45:09.810Z

**You:** Give me a example for correction

*Time:* 2025-11-19T05:50:20.424Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Here’s a model of how you could revise your thesis statement for stronger grammar, clarity, and confidence. I’ll also include a brief explanation after.

---

**Revised Thesis Statement Example:**

**"AI automation will ultimately improve global employment prospects in the long term because there are many industries where humans cannot be completely replaced, and the development of AI will create new job opportunities."**

---

**Explanation of the changes:**
- Removed “I think” to state the argument more confidently.
- Used the correct verb tense (“will ultimately improve”).
- Used “many industries where humans cannot be completely replaced” (clearer and correct structure).
- “Will create new job opportunities” (correct verb form and formal phrasing).

---

**Would you like to try writing your own version now, or do you want to use/adapt this example as your thesis?**

*Time:* 2025-11-19T05:50:24.723Z

**You:** I would like to adopt the example,and I would like to ask for the rest of my first paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-19T05:54:39.159Z

**Assistant:** Great choice! Using that model thesis, we’ll focus now on revising the **rest of your introduction (the first paragraph)**—remembering that your top priority is grammar and sentence structure.

Here’s your introduction now, with the revised thesis in place:

---

**Original Introduction (with thesis revised):**
> Automation by AI has boost the efficiency in different industries’ production. This has caused a increase in number of unemployed people due to the AI automation is more cost-saved then human employees. **AI automation will ultimately improve global employment prospects in the long term because there are many industries where humans cannot be completely replaced, and the development of AI will create new job opportunities.**

---

Let's revise the supporting sentences for grammar, clarity, and flow. Here’s some feedback and a step-by-step approach:

---

### Feedback/Tips

- **Verb forms:** “has boost” → should be “has boosted.”
- “a increase” → should be “an increase.”
- “cost-saved then human employees” → awkward phrasing; should be “more cost-effective than employing humans.”
- Try linking the ideas smoothly.

Let’s break it down and revise one sentence at a time.  

**First sentence:**  
Original: “Automation by AI has boost the efficiency in different industries’ production.”

**Can you try correcting the verb form and phrase? Here’s a hint:**  
- Use “has boosted…”  
- Try: “in the production processes of different industries.”

Would you like to write the corrected sentence now? (If you need a model, just ask!)

---

**Your turn:**  
Please write the first sentence of your introduction, focusing on correct verb forms and sentence structure.

*Time:* 2025-11-19T05:54:45.514Z

**You:** Automation by AI has boosted the efficiency in different industries’ production. This has caused an increase in number of unemployed people due to the AI automation is more cost-effective than human.

*Time:* 2025-11-19T05:58:35.116Z

**Assistant:** Great job! Your revised first two sentences have much better grammar and flow. Let's take a closer look:

> Automation by AI has boosted the efficiency in different industries’ production. This has caused an increase in number of unemployed people due to the AI automation is more cost-effective than human.

### Feedback & Suggestions

#### 1. **First sentence:**
- “Automation by AI has boosted the efficiency in different industries’ production.”
    - **Even better:** “AI automation has boosted efficiency in the production processes of different industries.”
    - *This version is more concise and uses natural academic phrasing. “AI automation” is the subject, and “the production processes of different industries” is clearer than “different industries’ production.”*

#### 2. **Second sentence:**
- “This has caused an increase in number of unemployed people due to the AI automation is more cost-effective than human.”
    - Try:  
    **“This has caused an increase in the number of unemployed people because AI automation is more cost-effective than employing humans.”**
    - *Notes:*
        - “an increase in the number of...” = correct article usage
        - “because” makes it a clear cause-effect
        - “AI automation is more cost-effective than employing humans” is more natural

---

### Step-by-Step Revision Guide
Would you like to:
- Try combining your introduction into two clear, concise sentences using the improved grammar and structure?
- Or, would you like to see a suggested version to help you get started?

Let me know what you prefer! If you want a suggestion, just say “suggestion,” or you can try revising both sentences yourself first.

*Time:* 2025-11-19T05:58:40.948Z

**You:** Got it,now I would like to ask for any suggestions on my topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-19T06:03:32.576Z

**Assistant:** ⚠️ Error connecting to server.

*Time:* 2025-11-19T06:04:33.000Z

**You:** Got it,now I would like to ask for any suggestions on my topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-19T06:04:49.777Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let’s move on to **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision.**

---

## Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision

First, **please choose one body paragraph** (first or second) that you want to focus on.  
For example:  
- The paragraph about the medical care industry (where humans can't be replaced)  
**OR**  
- The paragraph about new jobs created by AI automation

**Which one would you like to work on for this session?**

*(Once you choose, I’ll review your topic sentence and offer suggestions!)*

---

### For demonstration, let's assume you select your **first body paragraph** (about medical care):

Here’s your current topic sentence for that paragraph:

> Firstly, many industries can’t use AI automation to simply replace job position of human beings.

### **Feedback on Topic Sentence:**
- **Grammar:** “job position of human beings” is awkward; consider “human jobs” or “human workers.”
- **Clarity:** The sentence should directly link to your thesis about AI not replacing humans in some industries.
- **Flow:** “Firstly” is fine, but could be replaced with “For example” or “To begin with,” for variety.
- **Suggestion:** Connect clearly to the thesis: “AI cannot completely replace human workers in many industries.”

---

Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now?  
**Guiding Prompts:**  
- State clearly that AI automation cannot fully replace humans in some industries.  
- Use confident, correct grammar.

*If you want a model, just ask! Otherwise, give your revised topic sentence a try.*

---

## Example Revision (for reference only—please try your own first!):
> “Many industries still rely on human workers because AI automation cannot completely replace the human role.”

---

Would you like to try writing your revised topic sentence?  
When you’re ready, post your new topic sentence and I’ll give you feedback (and further suggestions if needed)!

---

**Once you post your revision, we’ll continue to Step 3: Revising the rest of the body paragraph for grammar & clarity.**

*Time:* 2025-11-19T06:05:45.089Z

**You:** in many industries, AI cannot completely replace human jobs

*Time:* 2025-11-19T06:10:52.887Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! Your revised topic sentence:

> **"In many industries, AI cannot completely replace human jobs."**

This is clear, direct, and uses correct grammar. Well done!

---

## Step 3 — Revising the Rest of the Chosen Paragraph

Now, let’s work through the **rest of your first body paragraph**, focusing on grammar and sentence structure.

### Here’s your current paragraph (after your revised topic sentence):

> In many industries, AI cannot completely replace human jobs. For example, in medical care area, AI automation can help estimate what diseases the patient may be suffered and quickly give out with relevant medicine. Yes, it seems when AI compare with human doctor, the efficiency is much more higher. However nowadays AI technoloy can only give the result at about 90% accurcy, which is unacceptable in medical care area. If it is not 100% correct, there will be misestimated cases, and causing the patient still suffering from the diseases. Therefore, there must be human doctor there, AI automation can be a tool to help increase efficiency, but the final judgement should be done by human, as to avoid possible medical accidents. Therefore, it is not suitable for automation to replace all job position in long-term.

---

### Let's revise, sentence by sentence.
I’ll prompt you to try revising each one, and give you hints and suggestions as needed.

---

#### **Sentence 1:**  
> For example, in medical care area, AI automation can help estimate what diseases the patient may be suffered and quickly give out with relevant medicine.

- *Grammar Issue:* “medical care area” → “the medical field” or “healthcare.”  
- *Verb Form Issue:* “may be suffered” is awkward.  
- *Suggestion:* AI helps **diagnose** diseases and suggest treatment.

**Prompt:**  
Try to rephrase this sentence using better grammar.  
Hint:  
“In the healthcare field, AI automation can help doctors diagnose diseases and recommend suitable medicine quickly.”

Would you like to revise this sentence using your own words now?

---

#### **Sentence 2:**  
> Yes, it seems when AI compare with human doctor, the efficiency is much more higher.

- *Grammar Issue:* “when AI compare with human doctor” → “when AI is compared with human doctors.”  
- *Phrase:* “much more higher” → “is much higher.”

**Prompt:**  
Can you write:  
“When AI is compared to human doctors, its efficiency is much higher.”

---

#### **Sentence 3:**  
> However nowadays AI technoloy can only give the result at about 90% accurcy, which is unacceptable in medical care area.

### AI automation and Global Employment Prospects

AI automation has boosted efficiency in the production processes of different industries. This has caused an increase in the number of unemployed people because AI automation is more cost-effective than employing humans. **AI automation will ultimately improve global employment prospects in the long term because there are many industries where humans cannot be completely replaced, and the development of AI will create new job opportunities.**

**Firstly, in many industries, AI cannot completely replace human jobs. For example, in the healthcare field, AI automation can help diagnose diseases and recommend suitable treatments quickly. When AI is compared to human doctors, its efficiency is much higher. However, nowadays, AI technology is only about 90% accurate, which is not acceptable in the healthcare field. If it is not 100% correct, there may be misdiagnosed cases, which can lead to patients continuing to suffer. Therefore, a human doctor must still be present. AI automation can be a tool to improve efficiency, but the final judgement should be made by a human to avoid possible medical accidents. In conclusion, it is not suitable for automation to replace all jobs in the long term.**

Secondly, AI automation may also create lots of job positions in the long term. While workers are being laid off in the short term, they will find their own ways to adapt. For example, some may start their own businesses, which produce more job opportunities in the labour market. However, these are only small cases, and many workers still lose their jobs while the global labour market cannot provide enough jobs for them. Therefore, we should look further to see what value AI can bring. In the future, maybe 60% of current jobs will be replaced by AI automation. However, another 60% of new jobs could be created, such as AI security, AI manager, and AI protector. New industries related to AI will be developed, which will provide more jobs to the global labour market. It is even estimated that in the future, AI will bring much more job opportunities than there are nowadays. Therefore, AI automation will enhance global employment in the long term.

In summary, AI automation may replace many jobs in the short term. But in the long term, some positions in certain industries cannot be replaced by AI automation, and more jobs will be created because of AI. Therefore, AI automation will finally enhance global employment prospects in the long term.

## FINAL REVISED ESSAY (with improved first body paragraph)

**AI Automation and Global Employment Prospects**

AI automation has boosted efficiency in the production processes of different industries. This has caused an increase in the number of unemployed people because AI automation is more cost-effective than employing humans. AI automation will ultimately improve global employment prospects in the long term because there are many industries where humans cannot be completely replaced, and the development of AI will create new job opportunities.

**Firstly, in many industries, AI cannot completely replace human jobs. For example, in the healthcare field, AI automation can help diagnose diseases and recommend suitable treatment quickly. When AI is compared to human doctors, its efficiency is much higher. However, nowadays, AI technology is only about 90% accurate, which is not acceptable in the healthcare field. If it is not 100% correct, there may be misdiagnosed cases, which can lead to patients continuing to suffer. Therefore, a human doctor must still be present. AI automation can be a tool to improve efficiency, but the final judgement should be made by humans to avoid possible medical accidents. In conclusion, it is not suitable for automation to replace all jobs in the long term.**

Secondly, AI automation may also create many job positions in the long term. While workers are being laid off in the short term, they will find their own ways to adapt. For example, some may start their own businesses, which produce more job opportunities in the labour market. However, these are only small cases, and many workers still lose their jobs while the global labour market cannot provide enough jobs for them. Therefore, we should look further to see what value AI can bring. In the future, maybe 60% of current jobs will be replaced by AI automation. However, another 60% of new jobs could be created, such as AI security, AI manager, and AI protector. New industries related to AI will be developed, which will provide more jobs to the global labour market. It is even estimated that in the future, AI will bring much more job opportunities than there are nowadays. Therefore, AI automation will enhance global employment in the long term.

In summary, AI automation may replace many jobs in the short term. But in the long term, some positions in certain industries cannot be replaced by AI automation, and more jobs will be created because of AI. Therefore, AI automation will finally enhance global employment prospects in the long term.

---

### Next Steps: Revising the Rest of Your 2nd Body Paragraph

Let’s focus on **grammar and sentence structure** for the rest of this paragraph. Here’s your full second body paragraph (original):

> Secondly , AI automation may also create lots of job position in long-term. While labour are being lay-off in short-term , they will find their own ways to go. For example like starting business themselves , which produce more job position to the labour market. However these are the small case , lots of labour still lose their job while the global labour market can’t provide more jobs for them. Therefore we should look longer , to observe what value can AI brings out. Imagine in future maybe 60% of job in nowadays will be replaced by AI automation. However , another 60% of job were created like AI secure , AI manager and AI protector. New industries related to AI will be developed which provide more jobs to global labour market. even estimate that in the future , AI will brings much more job opportunities than nowadays. Therefore , AI automation will enhance global employment in long-term.

---

#### Let’s review and revise, **sentence by sentence**.  
I’ll guide you with prompts and suggestions.

---

##### **Sentence 2:**  
> While labour are being lay-off in short-term , they will find their own ways to go.

- Grammar: "labour are being lay-off" → "workers are being laid off"
- Phrase: "in short-term" → "in the short term"
- "find their own ways to go" is unclear—maybe "find new ways to adapt"

**Try rewriting:**  
"While workers are being laid off in the short term, they will find new ways to adapt."

---

##### **Sentence 3:**  
> For example like starting business themselves , which produce more job position to the labour market.

- Grammar: "starting business themselves" → "starting their own businesses"
- "which produce more job position" → "which creates more job opportunities in the labour market"

**Try rewriting:**  
"For example, some may start their own businesses, which create more job opportunities in the labour market."

---

##### **Sentence 4:**  
> However these are the small case , lots of labour still lose their job while the global labour market can’t provide more jobs for them.

- "these are the small case" → "however, these are only a few cases"
- "lots of labour still lose their job" → "many workers still lose their jobs"
- "can’t provide more jobs for them" → "cannot provide enough jobs for everyone"

**Try rewriting:**  
"However, these are only a few cases, and many workers still lose their jobs while the global labour market cannot provide enough jobs for everyone."

---

##### **Sentence 5:**  
> Therefore we should look longer , to observe what value can AI brings out.

- "Look longer" → "look further," or "look ahead"
- "to observe what value can AI brings out" → "to see what value AI can create in the future"

**Try rewriting:**  
"Therefore, we should look further to see what value AI can create in the future."

---

##### **Sentence 6:**  
> Imagine in future maybe 60% of job in nowadays will be replaced by AI automation.

- "in future" → "in the future"
- "maybe 60% of job in nowadays" → "perhaps 60% of current jobs"
- "will be replaced by AI automation"

**Try rewriting:**  
"For example, in the future, perhaps 60% of current jobs will be replaced by AI automation."

---

##### **Sentence 7:**  
> However , another 60% of job were created like AI secure , AI manager and AI protector.

- "another 60%"—unclear, but let's keep it as example
- "job were created like..." → "new jobs could be created, such as AI security, AI manager, and AI protector"

**Try rewriting:**  
"However, new jobs could also be created, such as AI security specialist, AI manager, and AI protector."

---

##### **Sentence 8:**  
> New industries related to AI will be developed which provide more jobs to global labour market.

- "provide more jobs to global labour market" → "will provide more jobs to the global labour market"

**Try rewriting:**  
"New industries related to AI will develop, which will provide more jobs to the global labour market."

---

##### **Sentence 9:**  
> even estimate that in the future , AI will brings much more job opportunities than nowadays.

- "It is even estimated that in the future, AI will bring many more job opportunities than exist today."

---

##### **Final sentence:**  
> Therefore , AI automation will enhance global employment in long-term.

- Already stated in prior sentence; but, for flow:

"Therefore, AI automation will enhance global employment in the long term."

## **Grammar & Structure Improvements**

**Quick Corrections:**

1. "In summary, AI automation may replace many jobs in the short term."  
   ✔️ This is clear and correct.

2. "But in the long term, some positions in certain industries cannot be replaced by AI automation, and more jobs will be created because of AI."
   - Generally, avoid starting a sentence with "But" in academic writing; use "However," "In contrast," or combine sentences for flow.
   - For parallel structure: "some positions... cannot be replaced... and more jobs will be created..."

2. **“may replace lots of job position”** → “may replace many jobs” (use plural).
3. **“some position in certain industries cannot be replaced”** → “some positions in certain industries cannot be replaced”.
4. **“more job will be created”** → “more jobs will be created”.
5. **Article**: “in the long term”.
6. Remove spaces before commas.

# Final Essay with Improved Conclusion

**AI Automation and Global Employment Prospects**

AI automation has boosted efficiency in the production processes of different industries. This has caused an increase in the number of unemployed people because AI automation is more cost-effective than employing humans. AI automation will ultimately improve global employment prospects in the long term because there are many industries where humans cannot be completely replaced, and the development of AI will create new job opportunities.

Firstly, in many industries, AI cannot completely replace human jobs. For example, in the healthcare field, AI automation can help diagnose diseases and recommend suitable treatment quickly. When AI is compared to human doctors, its efficiency is much higher. However, nowadays, AI technology is only about 90% accurate, which is not acceptable in the healthcare field. If it is not 100% correct, there may be misdiagnosed cases, which can lead to patients continuing to suffer. Therefore, a human doctor must still be present. AI automation can be a tool to improve efficiency, but the final judgement should be made by humans to avoid possible medical accidents. In conclusion, it is not suitable for automation to replace all jobs in the long term.

Secondly, AI automation will create many new job opportunities in the long term. While workers may be laid off in the short term, they will find new ways to adapt. For example, some may start their own businesses, which creates more job opportunities in the labour market. However, these are only a few cases, and many workers still lose their jobs while the global labour market cannot provide enough employment for everyone. Therefore, we should look further to see what value AI can create in the future. For instance, in the future, perhaps 60% of current jobs may be replaced by AI automation. However, new jobs could be created, such as AI security specialist, AI manager, and AI protector. New industries related to AI will develop, and these will provide even more jobs to the global labour market. It is even estimated that in the future, AI will bring many more job opportunities than exist today. Therefore, AI automation will enhance global employment in the long term.

**In summary, AI automation may replace many jobs in the short term. However, in the long term, some positions in certain industries cannot be replaced by AI automation, and more jobs will be created as a result of AI. Therefore, AI automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.**
