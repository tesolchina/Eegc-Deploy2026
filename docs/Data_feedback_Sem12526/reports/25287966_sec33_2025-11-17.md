**The Positive Impact of Automation on Global Employment**

In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated automation across many industries, dramatically changing both the job market and people’s daily lives. While automation has increased efficiency and productivity, it has also raised concerns about potential job losses and the long-term impact on global employment. Although some argue that automation is harmful to workers, this essay contends that automation will ultimately boost global job market prospects by increasing the demand for experts in supervision and quality control, and by creating new roles in innovation.

One advantage of automation is that it leads to more jobs in supervision and quality control. As companies adopt automated systems, they need to employ more supervisors to monitor production processes as well as quality control specialists to ensure that products meet high standards. For instance, in food production, automation requires human oversight to prevent errors and maintain safety.

Another advantage of automation is that it creates new opportunities for innovation and creative work as companies need employees who can bring creativity and unique ideas to succeed in an ever-changing market. As automation takes over repetitive tasks, companies have to rely on human creativity to stand out from competitors. For example, in the art sector, the rise of AI calls for more unique artworks that reflect human emotions and deep thinking. Even within the AI field, there is an increasing demand for experts who can design creative models that machines cannot generate themselves.

In conclusion, although automation brings some initial challenges to the global workforce, its long-term effects are overwhelmingly positive. By increasing the need for supervisors and quality control specialists and creating new roles that demand creativity and innovation, automation is boosting employment opportunities across multiple industries. As technology continues to advance, automation will be essential for economic progress and a motivation for future job creation.

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- **Content and Ideas**: 17/25  
  *Justification*: Some relevant ideas about automation and employment, but argument is weak, reasoning undeveloped, and confusion/contradiction in stance (e.g., essay states both “undermine global employment” and “boost the job market”). Lack of specificity on how automation creates jobs or affects employment.
- **Organization**: 16/25  
  *Justification*: Essay is loosely structured, with unclear paragraphing and logical progression. Thesis location is ambiguous; paragraphs lack internal coherence, and transitions are absent.
- **Vocabulary**: 16/25  
  *Justification*: Vocabulary is basic and sometimes inaccurate (“surpervise,” “pocession,” “effect” for “affect,” “repeat but create” unclear). Use of topic-specific terms is limited.
- **Grammar and Sentence Structure**: 15/25  
  *Justification*: Frequent errors (“some may hard to adapt,” “laid off of workers,” “must have adapted”), awkward phrasing, limited sentence variety, and verb agreement issues reduce clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 64/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Recent years witness the fast-pace development in AI, which brings Automation to job market and people’s daily life. Automation like a unstoppable wind, transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency in workplace.
Some may hard to adapt to this sudden change, believing this technological shift ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term. But this opinion is wrong. Automation will bring a great benefit in job market.
 In a short time, the technology shift result in the laid off of workers due to the high efficiency and convenience of Automation. But in the long term, things are different.
In the long term, most traditional industries or companies must have adapted to automation, making relevant adjustment. For example, to adapt the trend and ensure the quality of the products, the company must hire more people to surpervise the producing pocession and to test the quality of the products. Which means, the company will hire more people than before in specific position.
What makes a successful company? It’s value. Automation represent “repeat” but “create”. The whole market will look for innovative people because the company seeks for uniqueness and creative. Thus, there must be more new jobs created by the market but most of which only suitable for people who is unique enough and creative.
All in all, the technology shift will negatively effect the global employment prospect. But in the long term, it will definitely boost the job market.

---

If you’re ready, let’s go on to **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**.

---

## Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision

### 1. **Choose One Body Paragraph to Work On**

Let’s look at your essay and pick a paragraph to revise. For clarity, here are two possible candidates from your text (with minor corrections for readability):

**Candidate A (paragraph about supervision and quality control):**
> "In the long term, most traditional industries or companies will have adapted to automation, making relevant adjustments. For example, to adapt to the trend and ensure the quality of products, companies must hire more people to supervise production processes and to test product quality. This means companies will hire more people than before in specific positions."

**Candidate B (paragraph about innovation/new jobs):**
> "What makes a successful company? It’s value. Automation represents 'repeat,' but not 'create.' The whole market will look for innovative people because companies seek uniqueness and creativity. Thus, there must be more new jobs created by the market, but most of which are only suitable for people who are unique enough and creative."

**Prompt:**  
Which paragraph would you like to revise now—supervision/quality control (A), or innovation/new jobs (B)?  
*Type “A” or “B” to choose, or paste the paragraph you want to work on.*

Once you’ve chosen, please copy-paste that paragraph’s topic sentence (usually the first sentence), and we’ll work on improving its connection to your new thesis. Would you like to begin?

*Time:* 2025-11-17T02:33:01.556Z

**You:** A

*Time:* 2025-11-17T02:38:38.182Z

**Assistant:** Great! You’ve chosen **Paragraph A** (about supervision and quality control) for revision.

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

## Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision

### 1. **Identifying the Current Topic Sentence**

Here’s the start of your paragraph A:

> "In the long term, most traditional industries or companies must have adapted to automation, making relevant adjustment."

This is your topic sentence, but let's see how it works:

- **Does it clearly link back to the thesis?**
- **Does it introduce the main idea (new jobs in supervision and quality control)?**
- **Is the language confident and academic?**

#### Feedback:
- It mentions adaptation, but doesn’t clearly connect to the idea of new jobs or specify supervision/quality control.
- The phrase “must have adapted” is a bit unclear and not very direct.
- Slight grammar correction needed ("must have adapted" → "will have adapted" or "are adapting," and "adjustment" → "adjustments").

---

### 2. **Guided Revision Prompt**

Let’s improve the topic sentence so it:
- Connects directly to your thesis statement.
- Clearly states the main point: automation leads to new jobs in supervision and quality control.
- Uses academic and confident language.

**Quick brainstorming questions to help you:**
- What is the main idea of this paragraph? (Is it: automation creates new jobs in supervision and quality control?)
- Can you use a phrase that clearly connects back to your thesis? (e.g., “One major reason...”, “A key way automation boosts employment is...”)

---

**Here’s a simple template you can try:**
> "One important way that automation boosts employment is by creating new jobs in supervision and quality control."

Or you can try combining your own ideas!

**Would you like to revise your topic sentence now?** Please type your improved version here (you can use my suggestion, or write your own!). If you’d like more hints, just ask.

*Time:* 2025-11-17T02:38:44.156Z

**You:** One advantage of automation is that it boosts job market through improving the employment rate in some position such as supervision and quality control.

*Time:* 2025-11-17T02:45:10.945Z

**Assistant:** Excellent effort revising your topic sentence! Let's review your draft topic sentence together and fine-tune it so it clearly supports your thesis, uses confident and accurate academic language, and provides a logical focus for the body paragraph.

---

## **Your Revised Topic Sentence**
> "One advantage of automation is that it boosts job market through improving the employment rate in some position such as supervision and quality control."

---

### **Feedback & Guided Suggestions**

**Strengths:**
- You’re connecting automation to job market benefits—very good!
- You specifically mention supervision and quality control—this aligns perfectly with your thesis.

**Improvements to Consider:**
1. **Grammar & Precision:**
    - “boosts job market” → should be “boosts the job market” or “boosts employment.”
    - “improving the employment rate in some position” → try “by creating new positions in supervision and quality control.”
    - “position” should be plural (“positions”).
2. **Clarity:**  
    - Make sure it’s direct and academic.
    - Make the connection to your thesis explicit.

---

### **Two Model Revisions (choose or use as inspiration):**

**Option 1 (Direct and Academic):**
> "A key way automation benefits the job market is by creating new positions in supervision and quality control."

**Option 2 (Parallel to Thesis):**
> "One important reason automation will boost global employment is that it leads to more jobs in supervision and quality control."

---

### **Your Turn!**

**Would you like to revise your topic sentence again using these suggestions, or do you want to keep your current version?**  
*(Feel free to combine your ideas with these options, or use one as a model!)*

When you’re happy with your revised topic sentence, please type it below.  
I’ll confirm it before we move to **Step 3: Revising the Rest of the Paragraph**!

### **Your Revised Paragraph**

> **One advantage of automation is that it leads to more jobs in supervision and quality control. As companies adopt automated systems, they have to employ more supervisors to monitor production processes as well as quality control specialists to ensure that products meet high standards. For instance, in food production, automation can't be applied without human oversight to prevent errors and maintain safety.**

### **Suggestions for Minor Polishing**
To make your paragraph slightly more formal and concise, consider these tiny revisions:
- “have to” → “need to”
- “automation can't be applied without human oversight” → “automation requires human oversight”

**Polished version (for your reference only; you don’t need to change unless you want to):**
> One advantage of automation is that it leads to more jobs in supervision and quality control. As companies adopt automated systems, they need to employ more supervisors to monitor production processes as well as quality control specialists to ensure that products meet high standards. For instance, in food production, automation requires human oversight to prevent errors and maintain safety.

# **Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision (Paragraph B)**

**First, here’s the original draft of Paragraph B:**

> What makes a successful company? It’s value. Automation represent “repeat” but “create”. The whole market will look for innovative people because the company seeks for uniqueness and creative. Thus, there must be more new jobs created by the market but most of which only suitable for people who is unique enough and creative.

Let’s identify and then revise the topic sentence.

---

## **1. Identify the Current Topic Sentence**

The paragraph’s first sentence is:
> What makes a successful company? It’s value.

**Analysis:**
- This doesn’t clearly introduce your point about new jobs created by automation.
- It doesn’t directly connect to your thesis statement.

---

## **2. Guided Feedback & Revision Suggestions**

**Focus for a Strong Topic Sentence:**
- Directly state that automation creates new jobs in innovation or creative industries.
- Clearly link to your thesis (“boosts job market prospects by creating new roles in innovation”).
- Use academic, confident language (no questions, use statements).

**Template for help:**

> “Another way automation benefits the job market is by creating new opportunities for innovation and creative work.”

> “Automation also leads to the creation of innovative jobs, as companies need employees who can bring creativity and unique ideas to succeed in a changing market.”

---

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to revise the topic sentence yourself, using these suggestions, or would you like a hint/example first?

# **Step 3 — Revise Supporting Sentences in Paragraph B**

Here are your current supporting sentences (original text, with some slight error correction):

> Automation represents ‘repeat’ but not ‘create.’ The whole market will look for innovative people because companies seek uniqueness and creativity. Thus, there must be more new jobs created by the market, but most of which are only suitable for people who are unique enough and creative.

---

## **Guiding Questions for Your Revision**
1. **Are you clearly explaining HOW automation leads to new innovative jobs?**
2. **Do you give an industry/example where this happens?**
3. **Is the logic clear—why are creative people needed as automation increases?**
4. **Can you use academic vocabulary and grammar for clarity?**

---

## **Template (Only a guide, don’t copy!):**

> As automation is introduced, companies must find new ways to stand out from competitors. This pushes them to hire employees who can contribute unique ideas and innovative solutions. For example, while machines handle repetitive tasks, humans are needed to develop new products, design marketing strategies, or invent advanced technologies.

---

## **Your Turn: Revise the Supporting Sentences!**

## Step 3 — Revising the Supporting Sentences (Innovation & Creativity Paragraph)

Let’s look at your topic sentence and build logically from it:

**Your revised topic sentence:**  
> Another advantage of automation is that it creates new opportunities for innovation and creative work as companies need employees who can bring creativity and unique ideas to succeed in an ever-changing market.

---

### **Current Supporting Sentences (draft):**
> Automation represents ‘repeat’ but not ‘create.’ The whole market will look for innovative people because companies seek uniqueness and creativity. Thus, there must be more new jobs created by the market, but most of which are only suitable for people who are unique enough and creative.

---

**Please type your own 2–3 revised supporting sentences below**. Once you submit, I’ll review and give you feedback or help polish further!

---

**After you post your revision, I’ll help you combine your topic sentence and supporting sentences into a coherent, academic body paragraph and give closing feedback.**

*Time:* 2025-11-17T03:08:19.950Z

**You:** As automation takes over repetitive tasks, companies have to rely on human creativity to stand out from competitors. For example, in the art sector, the appearance of AI call for more unique artworks comprising human emotions and deep thinking. Even in the AI area, there is an increasing demand for experts who can design creative models that machines cannot generate themselves.

*Time:* 2025-11-17T03:59:13.174Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic job! You’ve written clear, logical supporting sentences that directly explain and illustrate how automation increases the need for creative, innovative human talent. Let’s review your work and make a few small adjustments for clarity, coherence, accuracy, and academic style.

---

## **Your Revised Sentences**

> As automation takes over repetitive tasks, companies have to rely on human creativity to stand out from competitors. For example, in the art sector, the appearance of AI call for more unique artworks comprising human emotions and deep thinking. Even in the AI area, there is an increasing demand for experts who can design creative models that machines cannot generate themselves.

---

## **Strengths**
- **Unity:** Each supporting sentence relates to the main idea (demand for innovation/creativity).
- **Development:** You explain the logic, and provide two examples (the art sector and AI development).
- **Academic Language:** Overall, you’re using more precise, academic vocabulary.

---

## **Suggestions for Polishing**

**Grammar/Clarity improvements:**
- “…the appearance of AI call for…” → should be “…the rise of AI calls for…”
- “comprising human emotions and deep thinking” → perhaps “that reflect human emotions and deep thinking”
- “Even in the AI area…” → “Even within the AI field…”

Here’s how your revised paragraph could look with these minor adjustments (your ideas, just tidied):

---

> Another advantage of automation is that it creates new opportunities for innovation and creative work as companies need employees who can bring creativity and unique ideas to succeed in an ever-changing market. As automation takes over repetitive tasks, companies have to rely on human creativity to stand out from competitors. For example, in the art sector, the rise of AI calls for more unique artworks that reflect human emotions and deep thinking. Even within the AI field, there is an increasing demand for experts who can design creative models that machines cannot generate themselves.

---

# 3. Conclusion Revision

**Original:**
> All in all, the technology shift will negatively effect the global employment prospect. But in the long term, it will definitely boost the job market.

**Main Issues:**
- The first sentence contradicts your argument (“will negatively effect...”)

One advantage of automation is that it leads to more jobs in supervision and quality control. As companies adopt automated systems, they need to employ more supervisors to monitor production processes as well as quality control specialists to ensure that products meet high standards. For instance, in food production, automation requires human oversight to prevent errors and maintain safety.

Another advantage of automation is that it creates new opportunities for innovation and creative work as companies need employees who can bring creativity and unique ideas to succeed in an ever-changing market.

# **Final Revised Essay**

### *The Positive Impact of Automation on Global Employment*

In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated automation across many industries, dramatically changing both the job market and people’s daily lives. While automation has increased efficiency and productivity, it has also raised concerns about potential job losses and the long-term impact on global employment. Although some argue that automation is harmful to workers, this essay contends that automation will ultimately boost global job market prospects by increasing the demand for experts in supervision and quality control, and by creating new roles in innovation.

One advantage of automation is that it leads to more jobs in supervision and quality control. As companies adopt automated systems, they need to employ more supervisors to monitor production processes as well as quality control specialists to ensure that products meet high standards. For instance, in food production, automation requires human oversight to prevent errors and maintain safety.

Another advantage of automation is that it creates new opportunities for innovation and creative work as companies need employees who can bring creativity and unique ideas to succeed in an ever-changing market. As automation takes over repetitive tasks, companies have to rely on human creativity to stand out from competitors. For example, in the art sector, the rise of AI calls for more unique artworks that reflect human emotions and deep thinking. Even within the AI field, there is an increasing demand for experts who can design creative models that machines cannot generate themselves.

In conclusion, although automation brings some initial challenges to the global workforce, its long-term effects are overwhelmingly positive. By increasing the need for supervisors and quality control specialists and creating new roles that demand creativity and innovation, automation is boosting employment opportunities across multiple industries. As technology continues to advance, automation will be essential for economic progress and a motivation for future job creation.
