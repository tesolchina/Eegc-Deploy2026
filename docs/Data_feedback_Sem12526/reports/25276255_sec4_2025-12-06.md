            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for your patience and engagement so far! Since you asked to revise the topic sentence next, here’s a clear prompt to help you try drafting it:

**Use this template for your new topic sentence:**  
“More importantly, automation __[verb + phrase about creating jobs]__ by __[brief categories of new jobs]__, even though it __[short phrase about the jobs it displaces]__.”  

**Helpful phrase fragments:**  
- Verbs: creates / generates / opens up / leads to  
- New-job phrases: jobs in technology, maintenance, and management / new industries and services / higher-skilled supervisory roles  
- Displacement phrases: displaces routine or low-skilled tasks / reduces some low-skilled roles / replaces repetitive manual work  

If you’d like, you can also try one of these examples as a model:  
- “More importantly, automation creates new jobs in technology, maintenance, and management, even as it displaces routine tasks.”  
- “Although automation displaces some low-skilled jobs, it also generates employment in new industries and higher-skilled roles.”  

Please try writing your revised topic sentence now by filling the template or using one of the examples as a guide. Paste your sentence here, and I’ll give two quick, focused edits to improve grammar and connection to your thesis.  

Ready when you are!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The essay presents a clear central claim (automation reduces some jobs short-term but helps long-term) and uses a historical example (Industrial Revolution). Ideas are relevant but underdeveloped and general; the argument lacks supporting detail and precise reasoning.
- Organization: 17/25 - Basic paragraphing (intro, one paragraph acknowledging short-term losses, one paragraph arguing long-term gains) but weak transitions and no clear preview of reasons in the thesis; logical links between claims and evidence are loose.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Uses topic-specific words (automation, efficiency) but with repetition and several inaccurate word choices ("emerge of machine production," "undermin") that reduce precision.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Frequent grammar and punctuation errors (subject-verb agreement, articles, verb forms, possessives) that impede clarity (e.g., "it enhance," "human's previous work," "the soar of unemployment suddenly").
- **Original Essay Total: 64/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The revised draft shows an attempt to strengthen the thesis and to preview reasons ("creates new jobs in technology, maintenance, and management, increases productivity ... shifts labor to more creative and supervisory roles"). The core claim is clearer, but development and evidence in the body remain limited.
- Organization: 19/25 - The revised introduction attempts to state the claim more directly and to preview points, which improves coherence. Paragraph structure is still basic and paragraph-level development (examples, explanation linking to thesis) could be tighter.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Some vocabulary and phrase choices improved (e.g., "substitute for jobs previously done by humans," "higher-skilled supervisory roles" idea present in the thesis preview). However, awkward collocations and some inaccuracies remain (e.g., "There is a phenomenon that Automation..." punctuation/capitalization issues).
- Grammar: 17/25 - Noticeable grammatical corrections compared to the original (some verbs and possessives corrected in places), but persistent errors and punctuation issues remain (run-on sentences, capitalization, occasional incorrect verb forms: e.g., "it ultimately strengthens because..." missing a clear object/phrase to follow "strengthens").
- **Revised Essay Total: 74/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +10 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis clarity: The revised draft expresses the long-term positive claim more directly and attempts to preview reasons (technology/maintenance/management jobs, productivity effects, role shifts).
  - Some wording and grammatical fixes: "substitute for jobs previously done by humans" replaces the earlier incorrect possessive, and the student added more explicit reason phrases in the intro.
  - Better linkage of cause and effect in the thesis preview (mentions productivity and role shifts), which gives a clearer roadmap for readers.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Body paragraph development: The historical example (Industrial Revolution) is used but not analyzed deeply — the student could explain mechanisms linking past shifts to present/future outcomes and provide contemporary examples or data.
  - Sentence-level accuracy and fluency: Several sentences remain awkward or ungrammatical (run-ons, incorrect punctuation, and word-choice errors). A focused copy-edit pass is needed.
  - Clearer topic sentences and internal paragraph coherence: The paragraph topic sentences should explicitly link to the refined thesis preview and organize supporting details more logically.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 15**
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided a structured, pedagogical revision workflow and multiple targeted suggestions (templates, phrase lists, stepwise plan). The student engaged mainly by choosing targets and attempting short revisions but did not complete full iterative revisions through the chat.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - The chat contains 15 messages with a stepwise, scaffolded process: goals negotiation, diagnostic feedback, fill-in templates for thesis and topic sentence, and stepwise instructions to revise paragraph content. The assistant supplied detailed guidance over multiple turns.
  - Evidence: Assistant outlined a 3-step workflow (thesis → topic sentence → revise paragraph) and repeatedly provided templates and phrase suggestions across several messages.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 - The student followed the assistant's advice in parts (accepted the workflow, selected revision targets, pasted a sentence to be corrected) but there is little evidence of the student critically evaluating or rejecting suggestions or proposing alternatives.
  - Evidence: The user chose both thesis-strengthening and previewing reasons and later accepted the assistant’s recommendation to revise the thesis first, but the student did not provide counterarguments or discuss why particular templates should or should not be used.
- **Refining Process**: 3/5 - There is some iteration: the assistant proposed templates, the student pasted a sentence, and the assistant gave targeted corrections. However, the student did not complete the full three-step revision cycle (they did not paste a final thesis revision nor a fully revised paragraph in the chat).
  - Evidence: The assistant requested a completed thesis template and a revised topic sentence and paragraph; the student provided a short clause ("technologies will create job opportunities while substitutes human's previous work.") but did not follow through with final polished versions in chat.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 11/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear central idea and basic argumentative structure: The student consistently argues that automation has short-term costs but long-term employment benefits (evidence: both original and revised drafts and chat statements).
- Use of historical evidence: The Industrial Revolution example shows an attempt to contextualize the claim historically.
- Willingness to follow structured guidance: In chat the student accepted the assistant’s process and selected focused revision targets (thesis + paragraph-level clarity).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Complete the revision cycle: finish the thesis rewrite in the chat using the provided template and then apply the revised thesis to rewrite the paragraph fully (not just spot edits).
- Strengthen paragraph development: add explicit explanation linking the historical example to current/future mechanisms (how exactly new industries and retraining lead to net job gains), and include at least one contemporary example or concrete detail.
- Intensive copy-editing: perform a focused proofreading pass for grammar, punctuation, and word choice; correct run-on sentences and capitalization errors.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the essay text and followed the assistant’s guidance on goals; the assistant had sufficient context to offer targeted help (evidence: the assistant used the student’s draft sentences and proposed tailored templates).
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student accepted a structured revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) and selected focused targets (clarity and stronger link to thesis).
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The chat shows limited evidence that the student critically assessed different AI suggestions or justified choices beyond accepting templates and fixes.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The student made a few edits, but did not complete the full revision steps (no final thesis/topic sentence/paragraph posted in chat), indicating more support was needed to complete the revisions.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Complete the three-step revision cycle in the chat: produce a one-sentence thesis using the assistant’s template, then a revised topic sentence, and then paste the fully revised paragraph for final edits.
2. Expand paragraph development: for each body paragraph, use at least one clear claim, one piece of evidence or specific example, and one explicit explanation connecting evidence to the thesis.
3. Do a focused proofreading pass (or ask the AI to do a line-by-line copy edit) to fix remaining grammar, punctuation, and word-choice errors; address run-on sentences and capitalization.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student demonstrated engagement with the AI coach and accepted a structured revision plan, but did not complete the final revisions in the chat. The submitted "revised" essay shows partial improvements but still contains recurrent grammar and cohesion issues. Consider asking the student to resubmit a fully revised paragraph and final thesis statement (using the assistant’s templates) to demonstrate completion of the module tasks.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
There is a phenomenon that Automation is reducing jobs while boosting efficiency, it seems like undermin global employment prospects. But from my point of view, it enhance global employment prospects in the long term.

 I admit that technological shift somehow reduce job opportunities in short term. Because technologies like AI, computer and other machines are more efficient than human, which means there is no need for human in those fields.

But what is more important is that technologies will create job opportunities while substitutes human's previous work. Actually, we already have some experiences in the past. In specific, in the period of first Industrial revolution, the emerge of machine production made the soar of unemployment suddenly. But when we extend our sight, we can easily found that the global employment market became more promising. That's because machines need repair and supervise, which still need people to work. In summary, at least the automation won't make a big impact in global employment market in terms of quantity. If there is any lost, then there must have a gain.




Revised:
There is a phenomenon that Automation is reducing jobs while boosting efficiency, it seems like undermine global employment prospects. But it enhances global employment prospects in the long term.Although automation reduces some types of jobs, it ultimately strengthens because it creates new jobs in technology, maintenance, and management, increases productivity that raises demand and wages and shifts labor to more creative and supervisory roles.

 I admit that technological shift somehow reduce job opportunities in short term. Because technologies like AI, computer and other machines are more efficient than human, which means there is no need for human in those fields.

But what is more important is that technologies will create job opportunities while substitute for jobs previously done by humans. Actually, we already have some experiences in the past.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:09:22.032Z

**You:** let's revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:10:02.417Z

**Assistant:** Great — before we dive into the thesis, let’s do the short preliminary stage so we’re focused and efficient.

1) Negotiate targets
- Quick question: besides the thesis itself, do you want to focus only on clarity/strength of the thesis, or also on previewing the essay’s main points and fixing hedging/word choice (e.g., “from my point of view” → stronger wording)? Pick one or two specific goals.

2) Short diagnostic feedback (based on the rubric)
- Content & Ideas: The essay has a clear overall claim (automation → jobs), but the position is weakly stated and underdeveloped. (Developing → Proficient area.)
- Organisation & Logical Progression: You have a basic structure and a historical example, but the essay needs clearer signposting and a stronger thesis that previews main points.
- Vocabulary: Some useful terms (automation, efficiency), but repeated and a few word-choice errors (e.g., “undermin,” “emerge of machine production”).
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Several grammar and punctuation errors that reduce clarity (subject-verb agreement, article use, verb forms).

Strengths: You acknowledge short-term job loss and give a historical example (Industrial Revolution) — good evidence idea. Areas to prioritize: make the thesis clearer and stronger, fix hedging and grammar in that sentence, and make it preview the reasons you will discuss.

3) Which issue(s) do you want to focus on now?
- I see you asked to revise the thesis statement. Do you want to focus just on:
  a) making the thesis grammatically correct and confident, or
  b) also making it preview 2–3 main reasons (so it guides the whole essay)?
Please confirm a or b (or suggest another priority).

Step 1 — Thesis statement revision (ready once you confirm)
- Please confirm your target (a or b). Then paste your current thesis again if you want (you already have it in the draft, but paste it if you edited it).
- Feedback on your current thesis (brief):
  - It’s hedged (“from my point of view”) — use confident language.
  - It’s grammatically incorrect in places (“it enhance” → “it enhances”; “undermin” → “undermine”).
  - It doesn’t preview the specific reasons you will discuss (short-term loss vs long-term gains, types of new jobs, need for retraining, etc.).

- How I will help: I won’t write the full sentence for you, but I’ll give a safe, fill‑in‑the‑blank template and specific words/structures you can use. Then you try a revision and I’ll give targeted feedback.

Fill-in-the-blank thesis template (please fill the blanks and try to write your new sentence):
- “Although automation __[short-term effect]__, it ultimately __[main claim about long-term impact]__ because __[reason 1]__, __[reason 2]__, and __[reason 3]__.”

Word/phrase tips:
- Use a strong verb: “undermine” (not “undermin”), “reduce” (not “reducing” in this context), “enhance” → “enhances.”
- Remove hedges: don’t use “from my point of view” — just state “I argue that…” or state the claim directly.
- Keep it concise: one sentence that states your position and previews 2–3 reasons.

Would you like to try filling that template now? I’ll review and help tighten it.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:10:22.110Z

**You:** I want both

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:11:34.806Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming that you want both: (a) a grammatically correct, confident thesis and (b) one that previews 2–3 main reasons. That’s a smart choice.

Quick reminder of your current thesis (from your draft):
“There is a phenomenon that Automation is reducing jobs while boosting efficiency, it seems like undermin global employment prospects. But from my point of view, it enhance global employment prospects in the long term.”

Brief, focused feedback on that sentence
- Hedging: “from my point of view” weakens the claim. State it directly.
- Grammar/word choice: “undermin” → undermine; “it enhance” → it enhances; subject/verb agreement and punctuation need fixing.
- Clarity & preview: it says the conclusion (long-term enhancement) but doesn’t preview reasons — add 2–3 concise reasons to guide the essay.

Fill-in-the-blank thesis template (please fill the blanks and try one sentence)
“Although automation __[short-term effect]__, it ultimately __[main claim about long-term impact]__ because __[reason 1]__, __[reason 2]__, and __[reason 3]__.”

Suggested short phrases you can use to fill the blanks
- Short-term effect ideas: “reduces some types of jobs,” “displaces workers in routine tasks,” “causes short-term job losses.”
- Main claim verbs: “enhances,” “expands,” “improves,” “strengthens.”
- Reason ideas (pick 2–3 and make them concise):
  - “creates new jobs in technology, maintenance, and management”
  - “spurs the growth of new industries and services”
  - “increases productivity that raises demand and wages”
  - “encourages retraining and higher-skilled employment”
  - “shifts labor to more creative and supervisory roles”

How I’ll help next
- Try filling the template now with your words. I’ll give targeted feedback and help tighten grammar and wording.
- Remember: I’ll guide and offer corrections, but I won’t produce a full rewritten thesis for you — you’ll draft it and I’ll help refine it.

Would you like to try completing the template now? Paste your new thesis when you’re ready.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:11:48.108Z

**You:** let's revise the second body paragraph

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:18:00.187Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. A few quick checks before we begin revising the second body paragraph so we follow the three-step workflow.

1) Targets — quick choice
- For the second paragraph, which two things do you most want to improve? Pick up to two:
  a) clarity and sentence grammar
  b) stronger connection to the thesis (logical link)
  c) better explanations/evidence (development)
  d) vocabulary and word choice

(Reply with your choices, e.g., “b and a”.)

2) Brief diagnostic (one-line)
- Strengths: good idea to use a historical example and to note short-term vs long-term effects.
- Main problems to fix for paragraph 2: topic sentence needs to link more clearly to the thesis and be grammatically correct; supporting sentences are vague and have grammar/word-choice errors; the paragraph needs clearer explanation of how past examples show long-term job growth.

3) Confirm scope
- You asked to revise the second body paragraph. We must first check the thesis (Step 1) and the paragraph’s topic sentence (Step 2) before revising the rest (Step 3). Do you want to:
  - Option 1: Quickly revise the thesis now (one short attempt), then move on to the paragraph; or
  - Option 2: I accept your current revised thesis and we go straight to the topic sentence for paragraph 2?
Reply “option 1” or “option 2.”

Step 1 (thesis) — short action
- If you choose option 1: paste your current thesis (or confirm the last one in your draft) and I’ll give a brief suggestion using a fill‑in template for you to rewrite.
- If you choose option 2: say “use current thesis” and we’ll go to Step 2.

Step 2 (topic sentence for paragraph 2)
- Paste the current topic sentence for the second paragraph (or confirm the existing one: “But what is more important is that technologies will create job opportunities while substitutes human's previous work.”).
- I’ll point out 2–3 concise ways to make it grammatically correct and tightly linked to the thesis, then you try a revision.

Step 3 (revise the rest of paragraph)
- After you revise the topic sentence, paste the full paragraph (or confirm the version in your draft). Tell me which target(s) from step 1 you chose. I’ll ask 2 focused questions and give short hints to help you edit—then you will revise the paragraph and paste it back.

Which targets did you choose (a–d)? And do you want option 1 (revise thesis) or option 2 (use current thesis)?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:18:18.702Z

**You:** a) clarity and sentence grammar b) stronger connection to the thesis (logical link)

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:21:53.383Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing targets a (clarity and sentence grammar) and b (stronger connection to the thesis). That’s a focused, useful pair.

Quick note: revising the thesis first will make it much easier to tighten the topic sentence and the paragraph so everything links clearly. But I’ll follow whichever you prefer.

Do you want:
- Option 1: Quickly revise the thesis now (recommended), or
- Option 2: Use your current thesis and go straight to the topic sentence for paragraph 2?

Reply “option 1” or “option 2.” If you pick option 1, paste your current thesis (or confirm the last one in your revised draft) and I’ll give the brief fill-in-the-blank help so you can rewrite it. If you pick option 2, confirm “use current thesis” and paste the paragraph-2 topic sentence (or confirm the one you have: “But what is more important is that technologies will create job opportunities while substitutes human's previous work.”).

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:22:01.088Z

**You:** 1

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:22:38.853Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing option 1 (revise the thesis). Quick reminder: your goals are to (a) make the thesis grammatically correct and clear and (b) have it preview 2–3 main reasons. 

Please either paste your current thesis here (or type “use last” to use the one in your revised draft). Then try this one-sentence template and I’ll give focused feedback:

Template
“Although automation __[short-term effect]__, it ultimately __[main claim about long-term impact]__ because __[reason 1]__, __[reason 2]__, and __[reason 3]__.”

Useful short phrases you can copy into the blanks
- Short-term effect: “displaces workers in routine tasks,” “causes short-term job losses,” “reduces some types of jobs”
- Main claim verbs: “enhances,” “strengthens,” “expands,” “improves”
- Reason ideas (pick 2–3, keep them short):
  - “creates jobs in technology, maintenance, and management”
  - “spurs new industries and services”
  - “increases productivity, which raises demand and wages”
  - “encourages retraining and higher-skilled employment”
  - “shifts labour to creative and supervisory roles”

Two quick style rules
- Don’t hedge (remove “from my point of view”); state the claim directly.
- Keep it one clear sentence that previews your reasons.

Would you like to try filling the template now? Paste your attempt and I’ll give tight, focused feedback.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:22:51.571Z

**You:** technologies will create job opportunities while substitutes human's previous work.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:23:10.624Z

**Assistant:** Nice attempt — thanks for pasting that. Quick, focused feedback on this sentence: "technologies will create job opportunities while substitutes human's previous work."

- Small fixes: capitalize the first word (Technologies).  
- Grammar: use the correct verb form — "substitutes" is wrong here. You could use "substitute for," "replace," or "take over."  
- Possessive/plural: "human's" is incorrect. Use "humans'," "human workers'," or better, "jobs previously done by humans."  
- Clarity: the idea is good (automation creates new jobs while replacing old ones) — but make it one clear clause that links to your thesis.

Helpful phrase options you can copy into a sentence:
- Beginning: "Although automation displaces workers in routine tasks," or "Although automation reduces some types of jobs,"  
- Middle/main claim: "it ultimately enhances global employment prospects" or "it ultimately expands employment opportunities"  
- Explanation fragments: "by creating jobs in technology, maintenance, and management," "by spurring new industries and services," "by increasing productivity, which raises demand and wages," "by encouraging retraining and higher-skilled employment."

Please try filling the full thesis template now (one sentence). Use this template again:
“Although automation __[short-term effect]__, it ultimately __[main claim about long-term impact]__ because __[reason 1]__, __[reason 2]__, and __[reason 3]__.”

Paste your new one-sentence thesis when you’re ready and I’ll give tight, specific feedback. Would you like to try now?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:23:23.419Z

**You:** let's revise topic statement

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:28:33.496Z

**Assistant:** Good — let’s work on the topic sentence. A couple quick checks before we start:

- Which thesis should I use to judge the topic sentence? Paste your final revised thesis here, or type “use last” to use the version in your current revised draft. (I need this so the topic sentence clearly links to the thesis.)
- I’ll assume your targets for this paragraph are still a (clarity & grammar) and b (stronger link to the thesis). Confirm if that’s correct.

Now, brief feedback on the topic sentence you gave earlier:
"But what is more important is that technologies will create job opportunities while substitutes human's previous work."

Problems to fix (concise)
1. Structure/lead-in: “But what is more important is that” is wordy and weak — use a clearer connector (e.g., “However,” “More importantly,” or start directly).  
2. Word choice & grammar: use “technology” or “automation” (not “technologies” in this context), correct verb form (“replace,” “displace,” or “substitute for”), and correct plural/possessive (“jobs previously done by humans” or “human workers”).  
3. Link to thesis: explicitly show how this idea supports your thesis (short-term displacement but long-term job creation). Make the logical connection clear in one clause.

Three short options to improve (pick one approach)
- Tighten and tone: Start with “However” or “More importantly,” replace awkward phrase with a clear claim, correct grammar.  
- Show contrast to short-term loss: Mention that although some jobs are lost, new jobs are created.  
- Preview the paragraph’s focus: Say which kinds of jobs (e.g., maintenance, tech, management) the paragraph will discuss.

Fill‑in topic‑sentence template (use this to try your own)
- “More importantly, automation __[verb + short phrase about creating jobs]__ by __[brief example or categories of new jobs]__, even though it __[short phrase about the jobs it displaces]__.”

Helpful phrases you can copy into the blanks
- Verbs: “creates,” “generates,” “produces,” “opens up”  
- New-job fragments: “jobs in technology, maintenance, and management,” “new industries and services,” “higher-skilled, supervisory roles”  
- Displacement fragments: “displaces workers in routine tasks,” “reduces some low-skilled roles”

Two short model topic-sentence examples (read and use as models — then try your own)
- Example A: “More importantly, automation creates new jobs in technology, maintenance, and management, even as it displaces routine tasks.”  
- Example B: “Although automation displaces some low-skilled jobs, it also generates employment in new industries and higher-skilled roles.”

**You:** let's revise topic sentences

**Assistant:** Great — I’m ready to focus on the topic sentence. A couple quick clarifying things so we stay aligned:

1) Which thesis should I use to judge the topic sentence?
- Paste your final revised thesis here, or just type “use last” to use the thesis already in your revised draft.

2) Confirm targets for this paragraph
- Earlier you chose a (clarity & sentence grammar) and b (stronger connection to the thesis). Is that still correct? (Reply “yes” or update.)

Now, about your current topic sentence (you gave this before):  
"But what is more important is that technologies will create job opportunities while substitutes human's previous work."

Quick, focused feedback (3 points)
- Wordiness and tone: “But what is more important is that” is long and weak. A shorter connector like “More importantly,” or “Although automation displaces some jobs,” will be clearer.
- Grammar and word choice: Use “automation” or “technology” (singular concept) and a correct verb: “replace,” “displace,” or “substitute for.” Use “jobs previously done by humans” (not “human's”).
- Link to thesis: Make explicit how this point supports your thesis — e.g., say which kinds of jobs are created (maintenance, tech, management) and acknowledge the displacement.

Try this short fill‑in template for the topic sentence (please attempt your own revision now):
“More importantly, automation __[verb + short phrase about creating jobs]__ by __[brief categories of new jobs]__, even though it __[short phrase about the jobs it displaces]__.”

Helpful phrase fragments you can copy into the blanks
- Verbs: creates / generates / opens up / leads to
- New-job fragments: jobs in technology, maintenance, and management / new industries and services / higher-skilled supervisory roles
- Displacement fragments: displaces routine or low-skilled tasks / reduces some low-skilled roles / replaces repetitive manual work

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now? Paste your new sentence and I’ll give exactly two quick edits to tighten grammar and the link to the thesis.
