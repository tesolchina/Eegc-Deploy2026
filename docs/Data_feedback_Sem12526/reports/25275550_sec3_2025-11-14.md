        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
It is nndeniable that migrants issues has become a highly
debated topicin contemporary society. While there are valid arguments supporting the stance that migrants are not the part of those countries so government doesn't need to protect those migrants' right, I firmly believe that both native-born population and migrants should be protect under the law represents a more neasonable perspective.
In my view, migrants will help those countries reduce the
most of	pressure about labour problems, Those countries are all developed countries	
their native-bom population had received high level's education. So they don't want to do the labor job which is really hard In their view. At the same time, those migrants may all comes from some poor area, they don't mind to be a labor so I think ithey will help those developed countries. On the other hand , those migrants also have human rights, and we need to protect everyone's human right without there skin color an nationality. Everyone's dignity should be protect well. After that , our society will become more harmony and stability In the future,
In conclusion, I strongly suggest government eforce strcter laws to safeguard migrants rights. Those laws will not only protect native-born population and migrants rights but also enhance the social control. It will help those countries make a good role in the world and
to follow them , some small countries will pay mfocus on human	more	
rights. Then a harmony and stability atmosphere will be built. At that time, both native-born population and migrants will all have a better life. All in all,I think every law's ending target is to build a better society, so I think to promote a law that can protecting migrants rights is really important and useful

Revised:
It is undeniable that migrant issues have become a highly debated topic in contemporary society. There is no doubt that migrants should be protected by national laws. From a human rights perspective, the rights of both migrants and native residents must be safeguarded, and from a national perspective, migration contributes positively to a country’s development.
Immigration will help these countries solve their labor shortages, allowing them to reap greater profits. Many of these are developed nations with highly educated populations. Therefore, their citizens are often unwilling to engage in physically demanding jobs, which they consider extremely strenuous. Additionally, these immigrants may come from impoverished areas and are not averse to essential low-skilled positions. If the labor shortage problem is solved, the economies of these countries will grow rapidly.
On the other hand, migrants also have basic human rights and dignity that must be protected, regardless of their skin color or nationality. Ensuring everyone’s rights are respected will contribute to greater harmony and stability in society. By upholding these values, countries set an example for others and promote a fair and just environment for all.
In conclusion, I strongly suggest that governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrants’ rights. These laws will not only protect both native-born populations and migrants but also enhance social stability. By taking a leading role, developed countries can inspire smaller nations to focus more on human rights. In this way, a harmonious and stable society can be built, giving everyone, native or migrant, the opportunity for a better life. Ultimately, the goal of every law should be to create a better society, so protecting migrants’ rights is both important and beneficial.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.

My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:11:25.527Z

**You:** the topic you had shown is wrong, the true topic is "Should governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights?"

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:15:56.549Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for clarifying the essay topic! Let's start with the **Preliminary Stage** of our revision workflow.

The essay has basic structure (introduction, body, conclusion), but paragraph organization and flow need improvement. Some sentences are disjointed or repetitive.

- **Vocabulary:**  
You use some relevant terms (migrants, rights, government), but vocabulary is sometimes basic or inaccurate. Try to use more precise, academic words.

- **Grammar and Sentence Structure:**  
There are several grammatical errors and awkward sentences. Aim for more accurate and varied sentences.

*Just reply with your revision priorities or let me know what you want to work on first!*

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:16:02.427Z

**You:** Which areas would you most like to work on today?Grammar and sentence structure,Vocabulary (using precise, topic-specific words).which two areas would you like to focus on most for revision in today’s session?Grammar and vocabulary and Thesis statement and clarity.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:18:37.723Z

**Assistant:** Great choices! Your priorities for this revision will be:
1. **Grammar and vocabulary** (using more precise, accurate language and correcting sentence structure)
2. **Thesis statement and clarity** (making your main point clear and strong)

Let’s begin the structured revision process, focusing on these areas.

---

## **Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**

**Please copy and paste your current thesis statement here, or write it out again below so we can revise it together:**  
*(The thesis is usually the main claim or argument, found at the end of your introduction. In your essay, it looks like this part:)*

> "While there are valid arguments supporting the stance that migrants are not the part of those countries so government doesn't need to protect those migrants' right, I firmly believe that both native-born population and migrants should be protect under the law represents a more neasonable perspective."

Let's look at this together. I notice:
- The sentence is long and a bit unclear.
- There are grammar errors (e.g., “should be protect”, “represents a more neasonable perspective”).
- The argument (“both native-born population and migrants should be protect under the law”) is clear, but the language can be sharper.

**Here are some questions to help you revise:**
- What exactly do you think: Should migrants’ rights be protected under the law, equally to native-born people?
- Could you use clear, strong words like “all people,” “legal protection,” “regardless of nationality or origin”?

**Try rewriting your thesis statement so it:**
- Directly answers the essay question.
- Uses confident, formal language (avoid “I think” or “maybe”).
- Previews the main reasons (for example: benefits to society, human rights, etc. — if you plan to discuss them).

**Would you like to try writing a new version of your thesis statement now?**  
*(Write your new thesis statement below, or ask for a model/example if you need help!)*

---

Once you share your revised thesis, I’ll give supportive feedback and we’ll move on to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:18:44.529Z

**You:** Would you like to try writing a new version of your thesis statement now?There is no doubt that immigrants should be protected by local laws.From a human rights perspective, the human rights of immigrants and native residents should be protected. From a national perspective, immigration contributes to national development.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:23:27.828Z

**Assistant:** Great job! Your revised thesis is much clearer and more confident. You have included both a human rights perspective and the national benefit—this provides a strong preview of your main points. Let’s fine-tune it just a little for grammar, vocabulary, and academic style.

**Here’s some feedback and suggestions:**

- Consider using “migrants” or “immigrants” consistently (choose one for the whole essay).
- “Local laws” could be replaced by “the law” or “national laws” for clarity and formality.
- Try combining your points into one flowing statement.
- You can use “should be safeguarded” or “deserve legal protection” for a more formal tone.

**Here’s a slightly refined version as a model:**

> There is no doubt that migrants should be protected by national laws. From a human rights perspective, the rights of both migrants and native residents must be safeguarded, and from a national perspective, migration contributes positively to a country’s development.

**Now, would you like to:**
- Use my model,
- Make your own version based on my feedback,
- Or make further changes?

Let me know your final revised thesis statement. Once you confirm, we’ll move on to Step 2 – revising a topic sentence in one of your body paragraphs!

Would you like to revise the thesis further, or are you happy with this version?

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:23:34.429Z

**You:** I’m happy with this version.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:24:56.382Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic! Your revised thesis statement is now:

> There is no doubt that migrants should be protected by national laws. From a human rights perspective, the rights of both migrants and native residents must be safeguarded, and from a national perspective, migration contributes positively to a country’s development.

This is clear, confident, and academic. Well done!

---

## Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision

Let’s move on to your first body paragraph.

**Please choose one body paragraph you’d like to work on.**  
Here’s the main body paragraph from your essay:

> In my view, migrants will help those countries reduce the most of pressure about labour problems, Those countries are all developed countries their native-bom population had received high level's education. So they don't want to do the labor job which is really hard In their view. At the same time, those migrants may all comes from some poor area, they don't mind to be a labor so I think ithey will help those developed countries.

Let’s look at the first sentence–this is your topic sentence:
> In my view, migrants will help those countries reduce the most of pressure about labour problems,

### Feedback:
- The meaning is a little unclear.
- Some grammar and vocabulary improvements are needed.
- It should directly connect to the new thesis—focus on how migrants benefit the country (especially in the workforce).

**Guiding Question:**  
How can you rewrite your topic sentence to clearly show that migrants help the country by addressing labor issues (as your thesis previews)?

**Tips:**
- Mention “migrants” and “labor shortages” directly.
- Use clear, formal, academic language.
- Link to the idea of national benefit (from the thesis).

---

**Would you like to try revising this topic sentence now?**  
*(Write your revised sentence below, or ask for hints or an example!)*

Once you post your new topic sentence, I’ll give you supportive feedback and help revise the rest of this paragraph for clarity and grammar.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:25:01.777Z

**You:** Immigration will help these countries solve their labor shortages, allowing them to reap greater profits. These countries are all developed nations with highly educated populations. Therefore, they are unwilling to engage in manual labor, which they consider extremely strenuous. Furthermore, these immigrants may come from impoverished areas and are not averse to manual labor.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T14:28:56.455Z

**Assistant:** Great job revising your topic sentence! You’ve made your main idea much clearer and connected it well to your thesis. Let’s continue refining your paragraph for grammar, coherence, and vocabulary.

Here’s your current revised topic sentence and supporting ideas:

> Immigration will help these countries solve their labor shortages, allowing them to reap greater profits. These countries are all developed nations with highly educated populations. Therefore, they are unwilling to engage in manual labor, which they consider extremely strenuous. Furthermore, these immigrants may come from impoverished areas and are not averse to manual labor.

---

## Step 3: Revising the Rest of the Chosen Paragraph

Let’s improve the clarity, unity, and grammar in your supporting sentences. We’ll focus on connecting each idea smoothly and avoiding repetition or awkward sentences.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Do all sentences support your topic sentence about labor shortages and the benefit to the country?
- Can we use more academic vocabulary (e.g., "workforce," "economic growth," "opportunities")?
- Do any sentences need clearer connections or explanations?

Let’s refine step by step. Here’s your paragraph again for reference:

> Immigration will help these countries solve their labor shortages, allowing them to reap greater profits. These countries are all developed nations with highly educated populations. Therefore, they are unwilling to engage in manual labor, which they consider extremely strenuous. Furthermore, these immigrants may come from impoverished areas and are not averse to manual labor.

**Suggestions & Questions:**

1. **Sentence flow and transitions:**  
   - Can you use words like “As a result,” “Additionally,” or “This means…” to make your ideas flow better?

2. **Vocabulary improvements:**  
   - Instead of “manual labor,” you could say “physically demanding jobs” or “essential low-skilled positions.”
   - “Impoverished areas” instead of “poor area.”

3. **Expanding explanation:**  
   - Can you add one sentence to explain **why** having migrants take these jobs benefits the country overall (for example, keeping businesses running or contributing to economic growth)?

**Would you like to try revising one sentence at a time?**  
Let’s start with this sentence:  
> “These countries are all developed nations with highly educated populations.”

How could you make this sentence more precise or connect it closely to the topic sentence?

*Here's an example for inspiration (but you should try your own version first!):*  
> "Many developed countries face labor shortages because their citizens often prefer high-skilled or professional jobs."

---

**Please rewrite one sentence at a time, and I’ll give you feedback as we go!**  
Whenever you’re ready, post your first revised supporting sentence below.

Once you finish revising this paragraph, I’ll provide your fully updated essay with all your changes!

If the labor shortage problem is solved, the economies of these countries will grow rapidly.**

**On the other hand, migrants also have basic human rights and dignity that must be protected, regardless of their skin color or nationality. Ensuring everyone’s rights are respected will contribute to greater harmony and stability in society. By upholding these values, countries set an example for others and promote a fair and just environment for all.**

**In conclusion, I strongly suggest that governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrants’ rights. These laws will not only protect both native-born populations and migrants but also enhance social stability. By taking a leading role, developed countries can inspire smaller nations to focus more on human rights. In this way, a harmonious and stable society can be built, giving everyone, native or migrant, the opportunity for a better life. Ultimately, the goal of every law should be to create a better society, so protecting migrants’ rights is both important and beneficial.**

From a human rights perspective, the rights of both migrants and native residents must be safeguarded, and from a national perspective, migration contributes positively to a country’s development.**

**Immigration will help these countries solve their labor shortages, allowing them to reap greater profits. Many of these are developed nations with highly educated populations.

If the labor shortage problem is solved, the economies of these countries will grow rapidly.**
