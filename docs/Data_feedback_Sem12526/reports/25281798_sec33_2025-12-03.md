            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing the full context and your draft paragraphs along with the revision process so far. Here is a detailed overall assessment and guidance to help you finalize your essay revision effectively:

---

### Summary of Current Status

- **Thesis statement:** You successfully revised it to a clear, formal, and well-focused sentence that outlines your position and previews your arguments.
  
- **Body paragraphs:**  
  - **Paragraph 1 (Historical example):** You created an excellent topic sentence and revised supporting sentences to be clearer, more formal, and more cohesive.  
  - **Paragraph 3 (Challenges & government role):** You developed a clear topic sentence and added supporting ideas, though this paragraph still needs polishing for grammar, clarity, cohesion, and vocabulary.
  
- **Paragraph 2 (Current new jobs by automation):** The full paragraph text wasn’t finalized or provided in the chat log, so it’s your next key revision step.

---

### Final Recommendations and Steps to Complete Your Revision

#### 1. **Complete Revision of the Second Body Paragraph**

Since the historical example (P1) and the government role paragraph (P3) are progressing well, I recommend you finalize your paragraph on **how automation today creates new jobs**.

- Draft a clear topic sentence linking explicitly back to your thesis.
- Develop supporting sentences that explain examples like robot operators, AI data trainers.
- Use formal, precise vocabulary and varied sentence structures.
- Ensure smooth logical flow and effective transitions.

If you want, I can help you draft or polish this paragraph based on your initial ideas — just paste what you have or let me know if you'd like to create it from scratch.

---

#### 2. **Polish and Integrate Third Paragraph**

You shared a very good topic sentence for paragraph 3:

> *Despite the benefits of automation, some groups—such as older workers—face difficulties adapting, which highlights the important role governments play in supporting workforce transitions.*

Now, focus on polishing the rest of the paragraph by:

- Expanding with specific examples of government support:  
  e.g., retraining programs, skill development courses, financial aid.

- Clarifying and polishing the explanation of productivity gains and how those gains fund social welfare.

- Using clear transitions like:  
  *Moreover*, *Therefore*, *Consequently*, *By investing in human capital*.

- Writing a strong concluding sentence linking back to your thesis about the overall positive employment impact of automation with proper support.

Feel free to share a new draft whenever you want feedback.

---

#### 3. **Enhance Transitions Between Paragraphs**

To improve organization and flow, add clear transition sentences or phrases at the end/start of paragraphs, for example:

- End P1 with a sentence preparing for current examples in P2.
- Start P2 referencing historical precedent mentioned in P1.
- Use linking phrases like “Building on historical examples,” or “Similarly,” or “In modern times,” etc.

---

#### 4. **Review and Refine Vocabulary and Grammar**

- Replace informal phrases with formal counterparts (e.g., “no reason to worry” → “no cause for concern”).
- Check for mass nouns vs. count nouns (e.g., “automation” not “automations”).
- Vary sentence structures to combine short sentences and avoid repetition.
- Scrutinize verb tense consistency and article usage.
- Seek opportunities to use academic synonyms or precise terms (e.g., “productivity gains” instead of “AI outcomes”).

---

### How I Can Support You Going Forward:

- **Full paragraph revision:** Share your draft of the second paragraph, or your revised full third paragraph, and I will help polish the content, coherence, style, and grammar.

- **Transition crafting:** I can help you write smooth transitions between all paragraphs.

- **Final polishing:** After you finish all main content revisions, I can help with a final read-through to eliminate lingering errors and improve style.

---

### Encouragement

You have made **great progress** in:

- Strengthening your thesis,
- Creating clear and formal topic sentences,
- Improving clarity and cohesion in paragraphs.

Completing your essay with full, clear body paragraphs and smooth transitions will solidify your improvements and showcase your command of academic writing.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Automations, like robots in industry and AI tool as in daily life, have been highly developed. Some people worry about whether it will replace human jobs and have a bad effect on the global employment market. In my point of view, there's no need to worry. Human beings will not be replaced by automations, and in the long term, it will enhance the global employment.
There were some times people when people faced technology revolutions in human history. In 1805, horse feeders also worried that they would finally be replaced by trains, and they did. But the development of technology means not only the end of an era but also new opportunities. After they lost their horses, they got jobs in city factories. Automations, like AI tools and robots, also create new jobs, for instance, robot operators or AI data trainers. The ones who do not embrace the new technology lose their jobs.
But in reality, in fact, many people cannot accept or master the application of automation, indeed due to their age or other problems. The government should be responsible for that. While automation increases the efficiency, the capacity of the society also increases. Higher efficiency means more outcome with less effort. To view the society as a whole, some of the outcome may could be used to increase the societal welfare, like official courses teaching people how to deal with automation or working skills enhancement So, in conclusion, it the state is functioning well, there is no worry about the automation. Embrace it instead of keeping it away.

Revised:
Automation, like robots in industry and AI tool as in daily life, have been highly developed. Some people worry about whether it will replace human jobs and have a bad effect on the global employment market. In my point of view, there's no need to worry. Human beings will not be replaced by automation, and in the long run, automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects.
Historical technological changes show that while some jobs disappear, new opportunities also emerge, supporting the idea that automation will ultimately benefit employment. Throughout history, people have faced technological revolutions that transformed the nature of work. In 1805, coachmen worried that trains would replace their jobs, which eventually occurred. Technological development signals not only the end of an era but also the creation of new opportunities. After losing their jobs with horses, they found employment in urban factories. Automation, like AI tools and robots, also create new jobs, for instance, robot operators or AI data trainers. Workers who fail to adapt to new technologies risk losing their employment opportunities.
Despite automation’s benefits, some groups, such as older workers, struggle to adapt, highlighting the government’s important role in supporting their transition. Governments should provide comprehensive support to help affected workers adapt to new technologies. This can include offering retraining programs, skills development courses, and financial assistance to facilitate career transitions. Moreover, automation increases productivity and efficiency, resulting in economic gains that can be reinvested into social welfare programs designed to assist workers during periods of technological change. Higher efficiency means more outcome with less effort. By investing in human capital and social support, governments can ensure that automation’s positive impact on employment is accessible to all members of society. Therefore, with effective government intervention, concerns about automation’s impact on jobs can be mitigated, allowing society to fully benefit from technological advancements.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-03T10:20:56.153Z

**You:** a quick diagnosis

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:18:29.043Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your essay draft! Here's a quick diagnostic overview based on the rubric categories, highlighting strengths and areas you might focus on:

**Content and Ideas:**  
Your essay presents a clear viewpoint: that automation will ultimately enhance global employment. You provide relevant examples like historical technological shifts and potential new job types. However, some ideas are a bit underdeveloped or unclear—for instance, how exactly society benefits or the government’s role could be explained more fully.

**Organization and Logical Progression:**  
The essay has a basic structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Some paragraph transitions and sentence connections could be smoother, and the logical flow is occasionally disrupted by unclear phrases or repetition.

**Vocabulary:**  
Your vocabulary is adequate and appropriate for the topic, but some word choices are repeated or imprecise (“automations” should be “automation” as a mass noun, for example). There is room to include more varied and precise academic language.

**Grammar and Sentence Structure:**  
There are frequent grammatical errors and awkward sentence constructions (e.g., “In my point of view,” “may could be used,” “it the state is functioning well”). Sentence variety is limited, and some sentences are confusing or incomplete.

Now, before we start revising, could you tell me which one or two areas you'd most like to focus on today? For example, do you want to work on making your thesis clearer and stronger, improving sentence structure and grammar, strengthening paragraph organization, or something else?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:18:37.394Z

**You:** you may tell me how this could be graded in IELTS writing test part 2.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:19:45.860Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for your thoughtful question! Based on the essay draft you shared and the IELTS Writing Task 2 assessment criteria, here’s an approximate evaluation and explanation aligned with the IELTS band descriptors:

---

### IELTS Writing Task 2 Estimated Band Score: **5.0 to 5.5**

**Here is the breakdown by IELTS criteria:**

1. **Task Response (5.0)**  
- You address the question and present a clear opinion that automation will enhance employment in the long term.  
- Examples and ideas are relevant but basic and often underdeveloped or unclear in places.  
- Some points need further explanation or stronger connection to the main argument.  
- The response sometimes loses focus or uses repetitive reasoning.

2. **Coherence and Cohesion (5.0)**  
- The essay has a recognizable structure (introduction, body, conclusion).  
- Paragraphing is attempted but transitions between ideas and sentences are often abrupt or confusing.  
- Some sentences and phrases lack clarity, which interrupts the logical progression.  
- Repetitive connectors or unclear referencing occur (e.g., “in my point of view,” “there were some times people when people”).

3. **Lexical Resource (5.0)**  
- Vocabulary is sufficient to discuss the topic but limited and sometimes inaccurate (e.g., plural “automations” instead of “automation”).  
- Word choice is sometimes imprecise or awkward, and there is noticeable repetition.  
- Limited variety of academic vocabulary; some informal or conversational phrasing.

4. **Grammatical Range and Accuracy (4.5 - 5.0)**

- Revising and strengthening your thesis statement to make your position clearer and more confident?  
- Improving the topic sentence and organization of one paragraph to enhance coherence?  
- Working on grammar and sentence structure to reduce errors and increase variety?  
- Enhancing vocabulary for more precise and academic word choices?

Let me know your priority, and we can begin Step 1 of the revision process!

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:19:58.288Z

**You:** a bad result
, how can I improve my thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:24:06.265Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thoughts! It’s great that you want to improve your thesis statement—that’s an important step because a clear and strong thesis can guide the rest of your essay and make your argument more convincing.

Before we dive into revising your thesis, let’s look closely at what you currently have. Could you please share your current thesis statement again? I want to make sure we’re working with the exact sentence.

Once I see it, I’ll give you some feedback on clarity, strength, and focus, and then I’ll encourage you to try rewriting it yourself. How does that sound?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:24:10.398Z

**You:** could you explain the exact meaning of thesis statement for me?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:24:50.967Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! A thesis statement is one clear, strong sentence (usually near the end of your introduction) that tells your reader exactly what your essay is about. It answers the question or topic directly and shows your position or opinion. It also previews the main points or arguments you will explain in your essay.

Think of it like a roadmap for your whole essay. It helps guide your reader and keeps your writing focused.

For example, if the essay question is about automation's impact on jobs, a strong thesis might be:

*"Despite concerns about job losses, automation ultimately creates new employment opportunities and enhances global economic efficiency, benefiting society in the long term."*

This tells us:
- Your position (automation is positive overall),
- That you will talk about job creation and economic efficiency,
- And that you believe the impact is good for society.

Does this explanation make sense? Would you like to try sharing your current thesis statement again, and then we can work on making it clearer and stronger together?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:24:54.855Z

**You:** here it is: Human beings will not be replaced by automations, and in the long term, it will enhance the global employment.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:25:30.145Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing your thesis statement! It has a clear position—that automation will not replace humans but will enhance global employment long term. That’s a great start!

Now, let’s think together about how to make it even stronger and clearer:

1. **Clarity:**  
- "Automations" should be "automation" (mass noun without "s").  
- "Human beings will not be replaced" is clear but could sound more confident and formal if rephrased slightly.  
- Instead of “in the long term,” you might say “in the long run” or “over time” for variety.

2. **Strength and Focus:**  
- Try to preview the main points your essay will cover (job creation, economic efficiency, government’s role, etc.).  
- Avoid vague pronouns like “it.” Instead, specify what “automation” will do.

3. **Style:**  
- Use precise and academic language. For example, “automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects” sounds more formal and confident.

Here’s a suggestion to guide your rewrite (but don’t copy it verbatim — try to put it in your own words):

*"Although automation raises concerns about job loss, it will ultimately enhance global employment prospects by creating new job opportunities and increasing economic efficiency over time."*

Would you like to try revising your thesis now using this advice? I’m here to help if you want to share your attempt!

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:25:35.287Z

**You:** Let's review topic sentences next

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:30:34.028Z

**Assistant:** Great! Thank you for your effort with the thesis revision so far. Before we move on to topic sentences, did you want to share your revised thesis draft based on my feedback? Or would you like me to help you start with a fresh attempt?

If you're ready, we can also start looking at one of your body paragraphs to work on its topic sentence. This will help ensure it clearly connects back to your thesis and guides the paragraph logically.

Which paragraph would you like to focus on? You can tell me by mentioning the first sentence or what the paragraph is about. 

Once I see the topic sentence, I’ll give you some feedback and then ask you to try a revision. How does that sound?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:30:37.916Z

**You:** But the development of technology means not only the end of an era but also new opportunities.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:31:35.843Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for your thoughtful work so far! To keep making strong improvements, let’s choose one body paragraph to focus on next. 

Looking at your essay, here are the main body paragraphs:  
1. The historical example about horse feeders and technological shifts.  
2. The current creation of new jobs by automation (robot operators, AI data trainers).  
3. The challenges some people face adopting automation and the government’s role.

Which paragraph would you like to work on first? Or, if you prefer, I can help pick one that would benefit most from revision right now.

Once you pick, please share the paragraph’s topic sentence (the first sentence) with me. We’ll review how well it connects to your thesis and how to strengthen it. Then you’ll try revising it with my support.

What do you think? Ready to pick a paragraph?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:31:39.719Z

**You:** 1

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:32:10.285Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for choosing the first paragraph to work on! That’s the one about the historical example of horse feeders and technological change.

Please share the current topic sentence of this paragraph with me (usually the first sentence), and then we can look at how well it links to your thesis. After we discuss, you can try revising it to make the connection stronger and clearer. 

Go ahead whenever you’re ready!

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:32:12.694Z

**You:** actually there's no topic sentence

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:32:26.195Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for letting me know! Having a clear topic sentence is very important because it tells the reader what the paragraph will be about and connects the paragraph logically to your thesis.

Since the first paragraph currently has no topic sentence, let’s work together to create one.

Here’s the first paragraph’s main idea as I understand it:

- People have faced technological revolutions in history.
- The example of horse feeders worried about trains replacing their jobs.
- Although jobs were lost, new jobs were created in factories.
- This shows how technology can end old jobs but also create new opportunities.

Your task now is to write one clear, simple sentence at the beginning of this paragraph that:

- Summarizes this main idea.
- Links it to your thesis about automation creating new opportunities, not just threats.

Here’s a guiding question to help you think:  
**How does this historical example support your argument that automation will ultimately enhance employment prospects?**

Would you like to give it a try now? What sentence might work as this paragraph’s topic sentence? I’m here to support you!

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:32:29.999Z

**You:** technology can end old jobs but also create new opportunities.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:33:26.828Z

**Assistant:** You’re right—that’s the main idea we want to express in your topic sentence. Let’s try putting that into one clear sentence that connects directly to your thesis about automation.

Here are two guiding prompts to help you draft:

- **Think about the positive side of technology:** It replaces some jobs but also creates new ones.  
- **Make a clear connection:** This history shows how fears about job loss are understandable but technology ultimately opens new opportunities.

How about trying a sentence like this in your own words:

*"Historical technological changes show that while some jobs disappear, new opportunities also emerge, supporting the idea that automation will ultimately benefit employment."*

Would you like to try writing your own version now? Please share your attempt—I’m here to help you shape it!

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:34:53.442Z

**Assistant:** Great! You’re ready to move on to the next paragraph. That’s the one where you talk about how automation currently creates new types of jobs, like robot operators and AI data trainers.

Could you please share the topic sentence (the first sentence) of this paragraph with me? Once I see it, I’ll give you feedback on how clearly it connects to your thesis and how it might be strengthened.

Looking forward to your topic sentence!

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:34:56.404Z

**You:** no, the third paragraph

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:35:13.114Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for letting me know that you want to work on the third paragraph! That’s the one about the challenges some people face with automation and the government’s role.

Please share the current topic sentence (usually the first sentence) of that paragraph with me. Once I see it, I’ll help you review how well it connects to your thesis and then guide you in revising it to be clearer and stronger.

Go ahead when you’re ready!

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:35:15.785Z

**You:** But in reality, in fact, many people cannot accept or master the application of automation, indeed due to their age or other problems.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:35:29.891Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing that topic sentence! I see you want to focus on the paragraph that discusses people struggling to accept or master automation and the government’s role.

Right now, the topic sentence:  
**"But in reality, in fact, many people cannot accept or master the application of automation, indeed due to their age or other problems."**  

It identifies a real issue but could be clearer and stronger, especially in how it links back to your thesis about automation ultimately benefiting employment. Remember, the topic sentence should also guide the paragraph’s content and connect to your main argument.

Here are some thoughts to improve it:  
- Remove filler words like “But,” “in reality,” and “in fact” — they weaken clarity.  
- Be more specific about who “many people” are or what “other problems” might mean.  
- Connect the challenge clearly to your broader argument—perhaps by mentioning the need for support or government intervention.

As a guide, your revised topic sentence could look something like this (just as a model, not for you to copy exactly):  

*"Despite automation’s benefits, some groups, such as older workers, struggle to adapt, highlighting the government’s important role in supporting their transition."*

Would you like to try revising this topic sentence now, using this feedback? Give it a shot in your own words, and I’ll help you polish it!

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:35:34.422Z

**You:** How's my body paragraph?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:36:21.687Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for your effort in writing that paragraph! Before I give detailed feedback, could you please share exactly which paragraph or which sentences you want me to focus on? For example, are you asking for feedback on the entire third paragraph (about people struggling with automation and the government’s role) or just the current topic sentence you wrote?

Once I know your focus, I can give you targeted guidance on:

- How well it connects to your thesis  
- Clarity and logical flow  
- Vocabulary and grammar  
- Suggestions for improvement  

Looking forward to your reply!

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:36:24.596Z

**You:** all of my paragraphs

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:36:40.724Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for your openness and decision to work on all your paragraphs! That’s ambitious and very commendable.

To keep our revision session focused and effective—remembering our guidelines—I suggest we proceed step-by-step with the established three-step revision process:

1. Revise the thesis statement first, making it clear, strong, and focused.  
2. Then choose one body paragraph to revise: start by improving its topic sentence to connect clearly to the thesis.  
3. Finally, revise the rest of that paragraph’s content for clarity, unity, and coherence.

Then, you can repeat the process for each paragraph in your own time.

This stepwise approach will help develop your skills gradually and ensure each part is well polished.

---

### First, could you please share your current thesis statement again or your best attempt at one?  
If you like, I can help you make it even clearer and stronger before we move on to paragraphs.

---

When you share it, I’ll give you quick feedback and encourage you to try a revision.

Sound good? Whenever you’re ready, please send over your thesis statement!

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:36:44.566Z

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:37:31.358Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for your request! I’m happy to help you improve your body paragraph.  

Could you please share the exact paragraph you want feedback on? Or let me know which paragraph it is (for example, the one about the historical example, or the one about government support and challenges)?  

Once I have the paragraph, I’ll:  
- Review how well it connects to your thesis,  
- Check clarity, unity, and coherence,  
- Identify strengths and areas to improve,  
- Guide you on how to revise it with some focused suggestions.

Please paste the paragraph here, and we’ll get started!

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:37:35.419Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing that you want to focus on the historical example paragraph! To make progress, please paste the full paragraph here exactly as it is in your draft (including the current first sentence or any opening lines). That way, I can see the paragraph in context, check how well it connects to your thesis, and guide you in revising it step-by-step.

Once I review it, we’ll:  
- Check the topic sentence or create one if it’s missing,  
- See how clearly the paragraph supports your thesis,  
- Work on clarity, flow, and sentence variety,  
- Help you try your own revision with guidance.

Go ahead and send me the paragraph text!

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:37:53.691Z

**You:** There were some times people when people faced technology revolutions in human history. In 1805, horse feeders also worried that they would finally be replaced by trains, and they did. But the development of technology means not only the end of an era but also new opportunities. After they lost their horses, they got jobs in city factories. Automations, like AI tools and robots, also create new jobs, for instance, robot operators or AI data trainers. The ones who do not embrace the new technology lose their jobs.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:38:14.352Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing the paragraph! Let’s review it carefully together:

---

**Current paragraph:**  
*There were some times people when people faced technology revolutions in human history. In 1805, horse feeders also worried that they would finally be replaced by trains, and they did. But the development of technology means not only the end of an era but also new opportunities. After they lost their horses, they got jobs in city factories. Automations, like AI tools and robots, also create new jobs, for instance, robot operators or AI data trainers. The ones who do not embrace the new technology lose their jobs.*

---

### How well does this paragraph support your thesis?

- The paragraph attempts to give a historical example to support your thesis that automation creates new opportunities.
- The example of horse feeders being replaced by trains but then moving into factory jobs helps show that technology change can bring new employment options.
- You also connect this to modern examples of automation creating new roles.

### What works well?

- The general idea is clear and relevant—you are illustrating that technology shifts do not only eliminate jobs but also open new ones.
- Including the historical example alongside a modern comparison is a strong approach.

### Areas for improvement aligned with your revision targets:

1. **Topic sentence:**  
   The paragraph currently has no clear topic sentence introducing its main idea or linking explicitly to your thesis.  
   A strong topic sentence would preview the paragraph’s focus and connect it to your main argument about automation’s impact on jobs.

2. **Clarity and grammar:**  
   Some sentences are awkward or unclear:  
   - “There were some times people when people faced technology revolutions…” is confusing and grammatically incorrect.  
   - “Automations” should be “automation” (mass noun).  
   - “The ones who do not embrace the new technology lose their jobs” could be more formally phrased.  

3. **Coherence and flow:**  
   Transitions between ideas could be smoother. For example, moving from horse feeders to modern automation jobs feels abrupt.

4. **Vocabulary:**  
   Some phrases are informal or repetitive. Using more academic and precise words would help.

---

### Now, your task is to try revising this paragraph, starting with its **topic sentence**.  

Remember: a topic sentence should:  
- Clearly state the paragraph’s main idea.  
- Connect directly to your thesis about automation creating new job opportunities.  
- Be formal and clear.

As a reminder, here’s a model topic sentence we discussed earlier:  
*"Historical technological changes show that while some jobs disappear, new opportunities also emerge, supporting the idea that automation will ultimately benefit employment."*

Could you try writing your own version of the topic sentence for this paragraph? Try to write it in your own words but keep these points in mind.

Would you like to try now? Please share your draft topic sentence! I’m here to give you feedback and help you refine it.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:38:22.561Z

**You:** Historical technological changes show that while some jobs disappear, new opportunities also emerge, supporting the idea that automation will ultimately benefit employment.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:39:02.201Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! Your topic sentence is clear, focused, and connects well to your thesis. It sets the stage for your paragraph by explaining that technological change includes both job loss and job creation, which supports your overall argument about automation. Well done!

Now, the next step is to revise the rest of the paragraph to ensure the supporting sentences:

- Clearly relate to your topic sentence,
- Are expressed in clear, grammatically correct English,
- Flow logically from one idea to the next, and
- Use a slightly more academic and precise style.

Here is your current paragraph again for reference:

> There were some times people when people faced technology revolutions in human history. In 1805, horse feeders also worried that they would finally be replaced by trains, and they did. But the development of technology means not only the end of an era but also new opportunities. After they lost their horses, they got jobs in city factories. Automations, like AI tools and robots, also create new jobs, for instance, robot operators or AI data trainers. The ones who do not embrace the new technology lose their jobs.

---

### Let’s work together on revising this paragraph now—sentence by sentence:

- How could you rewrite the very first sentence—“There were some times people when people faced technology revolutions in human history”—to make it clearer and grammatically correct?  
- Think: “Throughout history, people have faced technological revolutions that changed the nature of work.”

Would you like to try rewriting that first sentence? Please give it a go in your own words! I’m here to support you.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:39:07.822Z

**You:** There were some times when people faced technological revolutions in history.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:39:57.522Z

**Assistant:** You’re definitely on the right track with that revision! Your version is clearer and almost correct—but to be fully natural and grammatically smooth, here’s a small suggestion:

**“There were some times when people faced technological revolutions in history.”**  

This sentence is good but sounds a little indirect or informal for an academic essay. We can make it stronger and more precise by saying:

**“Throughout history, people have faced technological revolutions that transformed the nature of work.”**

This version:  
- Uses “Throughout history” to give a broader, more formal tone,  
- “Have faced” (present perfect) connects the past with ongoing relevance,  
- Specifies that revolutions “transformed the nature of work,” which relates directly to jobs and supports your main topic.

Would you like to try rewriting your sentence now using these ideas, or would you prefer to keep your original with just minor fixes? Feel free to share your new sentence!

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:40:01.090Z

**You:** Throughout history, people have faced technological revolutions that transformed the nature of work.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:41:05.884Z

**Assistant:** That’s an excellent revision! Your new first sentence,

**“Throughout history, people have faced technological revolutions that transformed the nature of work,”**

is clear, grammatically correct, and formal—perfect for your academic essay. It sets the tone well for the rest of the paragraph.

---

### Let’s move on to the next sentence:

Original:  
*“In 1805, horse feeders also worried that they would finally be replaced by trains, and they did.”*

This sentence has a good historical example, but it can be clearer and more formally phrased. Here are some points to consider:  
- Use "horse feeders" or a more precise term like "workers who cared for horses."  
- The phrase “and they did” is a bit informal and abrupt; consider rephrasing to explain the outcome more clearly.  
- Avoid “also” here unless you are comparing to something in the prior sentence.

Would you like to try rewriting this sentence now based on these tips? Give it a go in your own words! I’m here to help you refine it.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:41:10.497Z

**You:** Coachmen, in 1805, worried that they would be replaced by trains, and they finally did.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:42:43.647Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing your revision attempt! Your sentence is getting clearer and closer to natural phrasing:

**"Coachmen, in 1805, worried that they would be replaced by trains, and they finally did."**

Here are a couple of gentle suggestions to make it even smoother and more formal for academic writing:

1. Remove the commas around “in 1805” because the date is integral to the sentence, not extra information.
2. Replace “finally did” with something a bit more precise, such as “and their work was eventually replaced by trains.”
3. Consider specifying “coachmen” as “workers who cared for horses and carriages” if you want more clarity, but “coachmen” itself is fine if your reader is familiar with the term.

Putting these ideas together, here’s a polished example you might use or adapt:

**"In 1805, coachmen worried that their jobs would be replaced by trains, and this eventually happened."**

Or more formal:

**"In 1805, workers who cared for horses and carriages feared that trains would replace their jobs, which eventually occurred."**

Would you like to try revising your sentence again with these points in mind? You can also keep it simple if you prefer! Whenever you’re ready, please share your next version.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:42:48.801Z

**You:** In 1805, coachmen worried that trains would replace them, which finally happened.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:43:58.448Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for your revision! Your sentence is clear and much improved:

**“In 1805, coachmen worried that trains would replace them, which finally happened.”**

This works well—it’s concise and connects the workers’ fear to the outcome. Just one small suggestion to make the phrasing slightly more formal and precise:  
- Instead of “finally happened,” you might say “which eventually occurred” or “which eventually became a reality.”  
- Also, “replace them” is understandable but “replace their jobs” or “replace their roles” is a bit clearer for academic writing.

So a slightly polished version could be:  
**“In 1805, coachmen worried that trains would replace their jobs, which eventually occurred.”**

Would you like to keep this version, or try one more revision with that phrase? Or are you happy to move on to the next sentence in the paragraph?  

Your paragraph is shaping up well! Let me know how you’d like to proceed.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:44:03.348Z

**You:** next

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:45:06.868Z

**Assistant:** Great! You’re making very good progress with revising this paragraph step by step.

Here’s your polished paragraph so far with the first two sentences revised for clarity, correctness, and formality:

---

**Revised paragraph opening:**  
*Throughout history, people have faced technological revolutions that transformed the nature of work. In 1805, coachmen worried that trains would replace their jobs, which eventually occurred.*

---

Now, let’s move on to revising the next sentence:

**Original sentence:**  
*“But the development of technology means not only the end of an era but also new opportunities.”*

This sentence has a clear main idea but could be made more formal and precise for academic style:

- Remove the conjunction “But” at the beginning—starting a sentence with “But” is generally avoided in formal writing.  
- Consider changing “development of technology” to “technological development” or simply “technological progress.”  
- The phrase “means not only the end of an era but also new opportunities” is good but could be made smoother with parallel structure, e.g., “signals not only the end of an era but also the creation of new opportunities.”

Would you like to try revising this sentence now using these tips? Please give it a try in your own words! I’m happy to help polish it after.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:45:10.930Z

**You:** Technological development signals not only the end of an era but also the creation of new opportunities.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:46:34.469Z

**Assistant:** Excellent revision! Your sentence,

**"Technological development signals not only the end of an era but also the creation of new opportunities,"**

is clear, formal, and nicely balanced with parallel structure. It fits well as a logical continuation after your previous two sentences.

---

To keep the paragraph coherent and on track, let’s now look at the next sentences:

**Original:**

*“After they lost their horses, they got jobs in city factories. Automations, like AI tools and robots, also create new jobs, for instance, robot operators or AI data trainers. The ones who do not embrace the new technology lose their jobs.”*

Some quick feedback on these:

1. “After they lost their horses” — could be clearer as “After losing their jobs with horses” or “After their roles related to horses disappeared.”

2. “they got jobs in city factories” — could be more formal: “they found employment in urban factories.”

3. “Automations” — use “automation” (mass noun, no “s”).

4. “also create new jobs, for instance, robot operators or AI data trainers” — good idea but could be smoother with a clearer lead-in: “Similarly, automation creates new job categories, such as robot operators and AI data trainers.”

5. “The ones who do not embrace the new technology lose their jobs.” — This sentence is a bit abrupt and informal. Could be improved by saying: “Workers who fail to adapt to new technologies risk losing their employment opportunities.”

Would you like to try revising this portion now? Break it into two or three sentences if that helps, and put it into your own words with these suggestions in mind.

Give it a go! Share your revision when ready, and I’ll help you polish it if needed.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:46:41.658Z

**You:** next paragraph

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:50:22.104Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic! You’ve done well refining your thesis and working on your first body paragraph. Now, as you asked, let’s move on to the next paragraph—the one about how automation currently creates new types of jobs (robot operators, AI data trainers, etc.).

### Please share the full text of that paragraph exactly as it appears in your draft (or as close as possible). 

Once I see the paragraph, I will:  
- Review its current topic sentence and overall coherence,  
- Give you feedback on clarity, connection to your thesis, grammar, and style,  
- Help you revise the topic sentence first,  
- Guide you to revise the rest of the paragraph for clarity, unity, and smooth flow.

Go ahead and paste the paragraph you want to focus on!

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:50:26.734Z

**You:** But in reality, in fact

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:57:13.391Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing! It looks like your message got cut off at “But in reality, in fact”—I’m guessing you were about to paste the paragraph you want to work on next.

Could you please send me the full paragraph you want to focus on now? For example, is it the second body paragraph about how automation creates new jobs like robot operators and AI data trainers? Or the third one about challenges with adaptation and government roles?

Once I have the complete text of the paragraph, we can start Step 2 by looking at your current topic sentence and then revising it to connect clearly with your thesis.

Looking forward to your next message!

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:57:17.766Z

**You:** But in reality, in fact, many people cannot accept or master the application of automation, indeed due to their age or other problems. The government should be responsible for that. While automation increases the efficiency, the capacity of the society also increases. Higher efficiency means more outcome with less effort. To view the society as a whole, some of the outcome may could be used to increase the societal welfare, like official courses teaching people how to deal with automation or working skills enhancement So, in conclusion, it the state is functioning well, there is no worry about the automation. Embrace it instead of keeping it away.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:57:32.396Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing the full paragraph! Let’s start Step 2 by focusing on the **topic sentence** of this paragraph:

---

**Current topic sentence:**  
*“But in reality, in fact, many people cannot accept or master the application of automation, indeed due to their age or other problems.”*

---

### Feedback on this topic sentence:
- It needs to be clearer and stronger.
- Avoid filler or redundant words like “But,” “in reality,” and “in fact.” These weaken the sentence.
- Be more specific about who “many people” are and what “other problems” might include.
- Make a clear connection to your thesis about how automation is beneficial but some people need support.
- Use more formal, academic language to improve the style.

---

### Your task:  
Try revising this topic sentence now to clearly state that although automation brings benefits, some groups face challenges adapting, which signals the need for government support.

Here is a guiding model to inspire you (please rewrite in your own words):

> “Despite its benefits, automation poses challenges for some groups, such as older workers, emphasizing the government’s role in facilitating their transition.”

Would you like to try writing a revision of the topic sentence now? Go ahead and share your version—I’ll help you refine it!

Once the topic sentence is strong, we can work together on revising the rest of the paragraph. Sound good?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:57:37.427Z

**You:** Despite automation’s benefits, some groups, such as older workers, struggle to adapt, highlighting the government’s important role in supporting their transition.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:59:05.209Z

**Assistant:** That’s an excellent revision of your topic sentence! It’s clear, focused, connected to your thesis, and introduces the paragraph’s main idea well.

Now, let’s move on to revising the rest of this paragraph so the supporting sentences relate clearly to your topic sentence, flow logically, and use clear, formal language.

Here is the paragraph you wrote earlier (slightly edited for grammar to show what we might improve):

---
*But in reality, in fact, many people cannot accept or master the application of automation, indeed due to their age or other problems. The government should be responsible for that. While automation increases the efficiency, the capacity of the society also increases. Higher efficiency means more outcome with less effort. To view the society as a whole, some of the outcome may could be used to increase the societal welfare, like official courses teaching people how to deal with automation or working skills enhancement So, in conclusion, it the state is functioning well, there is no worry about the automation. Embrace it instead of keeping it away.*
---

### Let’s work together through it step-by-step:

1. The first sentence repeats filler phrases (“But in reality, in fact,”) and is somewhat awkward:  
   You’ve replaced it with a strong topic sentence, so you can now remove these fillers and use your new sentence to start the paragraph.

2. The next sentence is:  
   *“The government should be responsible for that.”*  
   - This is very brief and vague. You could expand it to explain *how* the government should act (e.g., provide training, support services).  
   - Also, “responsible” can sound like blame—better to say “play a key role” or “should support.”

3. Following sentences:  
   *“While automation increases the efficiency, the capacity of the society also increases. Higher efficiency means more outcome with less effort.”*  
   - These are somewhat unclear and repetitive.  
   - Maybe explain: automation improves productivity, which can support social welfare investments.

4. Next:  
   *“To view the society as a whole, some of the outcome may could be used to increase the societal welfare, like official courses teaching people how to deal with automation or working skills enhancement”*  
   - Grammar needs fixing (“may could be” is incorrect).  
   - Also, “outcome” is vague—perhaps “productivity gains” or “efficiency savings.”  
   - The examples could be clearer and phrased more formally.

5. Finally, your conclusion sentence is a bit confusing:  
   *“So, in conclusion, it the state is functioning well, there is no worry about the automation. Embrace it instead of keeping it away.”*  
   - Fix grammar (“if the state is functioning well,” not “it the state”).  
   - “No worry about the automation” is informal; better to say “no reason for concern about automation’s impact on employment.”  
   - “Keeping it away” is informal; perhaps “resisting automation” or “avoiding technological progress.”

---

### Now your task:  
Please try revising this paragraph by:  
- Starting with your improved topic sentence (your clear revision).  
- Expanding and clarifying the government’s role in supporting workers.  
- Explaining how automation’s increased efficiency benefits society.  
- Giving specific, formal examples of government support (e.g., training programs).  
- Writing a clear, formal concluding sentence that ties back to your thesis.

Go ahead and give it a try! I’m here to help you polish it once you share your draft. Would you like to start revising now?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:59:18.702Z

**You:** The government should provide support. Automation improves productivity, which can support social welfare investments. Some of the AI outcomes could be used to improve the social welfare. If the state is functioning well, there's no reason for people to concern about automation's impact on employment.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:02:18.689Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your revision! This is a solid start—it’s clear you understand the key ideas.

Now, let’s work together to make these sentences stronger, clearer, and more formal. I’ll guide you with some questions and suggestions to help you expand and connect your ideas more smoothly. Remember, you take the lead on revising, and I’ll support you step-by-step!

---

### Here’s what we want to do next:

1. **Add your improved topic sentence** (the clear, focused sentence about challenges and government support) at the start.

2. **Expand the government’s role:**  
- How should the government support workers who struggle with automation?  
- What specific programs or policies could it provide? (e.g., retraining courses, financial aid, public awareness campaigns)

3. **Clarify how automation benefits society:**  
- Instead of “some of the AI outcomes,” could you say productivity gains or efficiency savings?  
- How do these gains create resources for social welfare?

4. **Make sentences more formal and connected:**  
- Use linking words to help flow (e.g., “Furthermore,” “Moreover,” “Therefore,” “Consequently”)  
- Avoid informal phrases like “no reason for people to concern about” and rephrase more academically.

5. **Write a clear concluding sentence:**  
- How does this paragraph connect back to your thesis that automation ultimately enhances global employment prospects?

---

### To help, here is a **guided outline** you can try to put into your own words:

**Topic sentence (your improved version):**  
> Despite the benefits of automation, some groups—such as older workers—face difficulties adapting, which highlights the important role governments play in supporting workforce transitions.

**Expanded government role:**  
> Governments should provide comprehensive support to help affected workers adapt to new technologies. This can include offering retraining programs, skills development courses, and financial assistance to facilitate career transitions.

**How automation benefits society:**  
> Moreover, automation increases productivity and efficiency, resulting in economic gains that can be reinvested into social welfare programs designed to assist workers during periods of technological change.

**Clear formal connection:**  
> By investing in human capital and social support, governments can ensure that automation’s positive impact on employment is accessible to all members of society.

**Concluding sentence:**  
> Therefore, with effective government intervention, concerns about automation’s impact on jobs can be mitigated, allowing society to fully benefit from technological advancements.

### Step 3 — Revising the Third Paragraph: Guided Revision

#### 1. Start with your improved **topic sentence** (or if you like, revise it once more now):  
You wrote earlier something like:  
> *Despite the benefits of automation, some groups—such as older workers—face difficulties adapting, which highlights the important role governments play in supporting workforce transitions.*

This is clear and well-focused. Let me know if you want to adjust it further!

#### 2. Expand on the government’s role clearly and specifically:  
- What should governments do? (retraining, skills courses, financial support)  
- Why is this necessary? (to help workers adapt and avoid unemployment)

#### 3. Explain briefly how automation increases productivity and how those gains create resources to support affected workers.

#### 4. Use linking words to ensure smooth flow (e.g., “Moreover,” “Therefore,” “By investing in…”).

#### 5. End with a concluding sentence connecting back to your thesis that with proper support, automation overall benefits employment prospects.

### Here is a **model outline** you can follow and put into your own words:

**Topic sentence:**  
Despite the benefits of automation, some groups—such as older workers—face difficulties adapting, which highlights the important role governments play in supporting workforce transitions.

**Government role:**  
Governments should provide comprehensive programs to help affected workers adjust to technological changes. This could include retraining courses, skill development workshops, and financial assistance to ease career transitions.

**Productivity benefits:**  
Moreover, automation improves productivity and efficiency, generating economic gains that governments can reinvest into social welfare programs designed to support workers affected by these changes.

**Concluding sentence:**  
By investing in human capital and social support, governments can ensure that the positive impacts of automation on employment are shared broadly across society.
