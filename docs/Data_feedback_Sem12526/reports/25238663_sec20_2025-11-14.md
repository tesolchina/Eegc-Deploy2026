            ## Contribution Analysis

            Based on the provided chat history and the training assessment report, here is a concise summary of the student’s interaction and performance with targeted guidance for future use:

---

**Summary of Student-AI Interaction:**

- The student’s engagement was limited and fragmented, providing minimal input (e.g., a very brief thesis statement: "Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today") and not responding directly to the assistant’s prompts for more detailed or specific content.
- The student made a general request to "Help me rephrase the topic sentence" and "Help me change the paragraph into formal tone" without specifying which paragraph or providing the actual text, which limited the assistant’s ability to offer precise revision suggestions.
- Despite being guided step-by-step by the assistant (starting from thesis revision before moving to tone and paragraph changes), the student skipped critical revision steps and did not engage in multi-exchange feedback or iterative improvements.
- The revised essay was essentially unchanged except for minor rephrasing in the opening sentence, missing opportunities to improve clarity, organization, vocabulary, grammar, and the formal tone of the essay.

**Key Points for Improvement:**

- Provide specific excerpts or sentences you want revised—this helps the AI give precise feedback.
- Follow the process the assistant lays out: revise thesis first, then move on to topic sentences and body paragraphs.
- Engage actively by responding to assistant questions, clarifying when unclear, and attempting drafts for revision.
- Treat AI interaction as a dialogue aimed at iterative improvement rather than one-step fixes.

**Next Steps for Practice:**

- Practice writing a clear thesis that states your position and previews the two main points.
- Share that thesis with the assistant for focused revision.
- Select a body paragraph and either paste it or describe which one you want to improve, asking for help with formality and grammar.
- Reflect on the suggestions and try to produce a revised version to share back.

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- **Content and Ideas**: 19/25 — The essay covers the key topic and shows some basic understanding of climate change challenges and the debate about individual vs. government actions. Ideas are somewhat developed but lack depth, nuance, or novel insights.
- **Organization**: 18/25 — The essay follows a logical progression (introduction, body, conclusion), and paragraphs are generally clear. Some transitions are weak or repetitive, and ideas could be organized more effectively for impact.
- **Vocabulary**: 17/25 — Vocabulary is generally adequate and understandable but basic. There are noticeable repetition and missed opportunities for topic-specific terms, with some informal phrasing.
- **Grammar and Sentence Structure**: 16/25 — There are frequent minor grammatical errors and awkward sentences (e.g., “so is not always working well,” “it not really enough to help”), which affect clarity and formality.

- **Original Essay Total**: 70/100

#### Revised Essay Scores:
*Note: The “revised” essay presented is nearly identical to the original, except for a slight rephrasing of the opening sentence. There is no evidence of meaningful revision to the thesis, topic sentence, or body paragraph as required.*

- **Content and Ideas**: 19/25 — No substantive changes were made; the ideas and structure remain essentially untouched.
- **Organization**: 18/25 — Paragraphing and order are unchanged.
- **Vocabulary**: 17/25 — Vocabulary remains limited and lacks improvement; formal tone not addressed.
- **Grammar and Sentence Structure**: 16/25 — No edits; errors persist.

- **Revised Essay Total**: 70/100

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement**: +0 points
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Only a slight variation in the opening sentence (adding “governments and companies play the largest role,” but the rest repeats the original phrasing)
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Thesis not properly revised for clarity or two-point structure
  - No topic sentence revision
  - No substantive body paragraph revision or formal tone improvements

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges**: 6 exchanges
- **Conversation Quality**: Limited; the student skips the expected revision steps and repeatedly requests changes without providing the information the AI requests (e.g., posting thesis statement, selecting a body paragraph), thus the chat remains superficial and fragmented.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 — Only basic prompts and requests; student does not respond to assistant’s guiding questions or engage in a multi-level conversation.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 — No evaluation or discussion of AI feedback; suggestions are neither accepted nor rejected, student does not engage critically.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 — No evidence of revision cycles or iterative process; student’s output is unchanged, and requests do not result in edits.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total**: 4/15

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- *Initial engagement*: Student attempted to initiate revision by requesting changes and rephrasings, and provided the thesis statement after prompting.
- *Willingness to use AI*: Student participated in the module and provided basic responses.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- **Essay Revision Process**: Student must complete each step: revising the thesis, a topic sentence, and a body paragraph.
- **Depth of Collaboration**: Should answer assistant prompts, provide specific text for revision, and engage more deeply in dialogue.
- **Critical Thinking**: Needs to ask clarifying questions, reflect on AI recommendations, and make independent changes showing understanding.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement — Student did not provide sufficient context or specify goals for each revision step.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement — No evidence of structured revision or planning, skipped expected steps.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement — No evaluation, reflection, or discussion of AI feedback.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement — No meaningful edits made beyond superficial changes.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing Skills**: Practice revising thesis statements to ensure clarity and coverage of both required points; work on paraphrasing topic sentences and expanding body paragraphs for formality and depth.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills**: Actively respond to AI questions, provide context, and ask for clarification when you are unsure. Reflect on feedback before revising.
3. **Overall Improvement**: Treat the process as a dialogue; aim for multi-exchange conversations and iterative revision (not one-step changes).

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student did not complete the required revision tasks (thesis, topic sentence, body paragraph).
- Intervention may be needed to teach the importance and process of stepwise, interactive revision.
- Consider guiding the student in a live setting on how to structure a revision session and interact with AI productively.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:59:16.872Z

**You:** Help me rephrase the topic sentence

*Time:* 2025-11-14T09:04:35.103Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely, I'm happy to help you step-by-step!

**Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**

First, let's focus on your thesis statement. Please share your current thesis statement here (the sentence where you clearly express your main point or argument for the whole essay).

Once you post it, I'll give you feedback on its clarity, strength, and focus so we can make it as effective as possible!

Go ahead and copy your current thesis statement, please.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T09:05:19.099Z

**You:** Help me change the paragraph into formal tone.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T09:07:46.662Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your request! Before we work on formal tone, let's follow the structured revision process. We'll start with your thesis statement, then move step by step to address tone in your chosen paragraph.

**Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**

Please copy your current thesis statement here (the sentence that presents your main argument in the essay).

Once I see it, I’ll give you focused feedback to help you improve clarity, focus, and confidence. After we revise your thesis, we’ll move on to your chosen body paragraph and work on making the tone more formal there.

Could you please paste your thesis statement now?

*Time:* 2025-11-14T09:07:54.831Z

**You:** Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today

*Time:* 2025-11-14T09:08:34.132Z

**Assistant:** Great, thank you for sharing your thesis statement:  
**“Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today.”**

Here’s my quick feedback:

- **Clarity**: The sentence is clear, but it does not show your position or the specific focus of your essay.  
- **Strength & Focus**: It’s a general statement. An effective thesis should:
  - Clearly answer the essay question (about the role of individual vs. government/company actions on climate change).
  - Preview your main points or structure.
  - Use strong, confident language.

**Suggestions:**  
Try to clearly state your viewpoint and the main reasons behind it. For example, do you think individual actions are important, or is it mainly up to governments/companies?

Would you like to try revising your thesis to make your position and main points clearer?  
(For example: “While governments and companies play the largest role in fighting climate change, individual actions are also important because [reason 1] and [reason 2].”)

Go ahead and have a try! I’m here if you want more hints or a model sentence.
