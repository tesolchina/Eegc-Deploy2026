            ## Contribution Analysis

            You’ve done a strong job clarifying your ideas and supporting your thesis in Paragraph 2! To help your writing flow better and enhance clarity, here’s a lightly edited version of your paragraph based on the suggestions:

---

When machines handle repetitive, time-consuming work like basic cleaning or standard driving routes, workers no longer need to spend hours on tasks that require little skill or creativity. Instead, they can be redeployed to roles that rely on human strengths, such as problem-solving, customer interaction, or coordinating complex projects. A concrete example is warehouse operations: robotic systems now handle most sorting, lifting, and material handling, while entry-level warehouse workers have moved into roles like equipment maintenance (ensuring robots run smoothly), safety oversight (monitoring workflow risks), or quality checks on orders (verifying products meet standards). These shifts do not eliminate jobs outright. They simply redirect workers to tasks that add more value to businesses and the economy. Roles focused on human judgment and coordination often improve efficiency, customer satisfaction, and long-term growth, which in turn sustains or expands overall employment opportunities.

If you’re happy with this edit, I can update your full essay draft with the revised thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph 2 content. Otherwise, if you want to try revising it yourself first using these suggestions, just let me know!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 16/25 - Presents a clear overall stance (automation benefits long-term employment) and several reasons, but development is vague and sometimes off-point (e.g., “We absolutely can not say that with the Apple’s appearance, many workers lose their job”). Limited use of concrete examples and causal explanation.
- Organization: 15/25 - Some signposting (“Secondly,” “Last but not least”), but frequent run-ons/comma splices blur logic; topic sentences do not consistently align with a clear thesis.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Limited variety with frequent misuses (“reply” for “rely,” “undouble” for “undoubtedly,” “labors” for “labor”); repetition and awkward phrasing reduce precision.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Numerous errors (subject–verb agreement, articles, punctuation, comma splices) impede clarity, e.g., “Automation nowadays is an unstoppable trend ,transforming industries, It can boost efficiency…”.
- Original Essay Total: 60/100

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - Stronger development in the revised body paragraph with a concrete example: “A concrete example is warehouse operations: robotic systems now manage most sorting, lifting, and inventory transportation…”. The thesis is attempted but still weakly reasoned (“automation is an unstoppable trend,” “the mainly performance of AI”). Other paragraphs remain underdeveloped.
- Organization: 17/25 - Paragraph 2 shows clear internal structure (mechanism → example → link-back). However, the introduction still has run-ons and the remaining paragraphs are not reorganized to match the new thesis.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Noticeable improvement within the revised paragraph (e.g., “coordinating complex projects,” “safety oversight,” “quality checks”), but inconsistent across the rest of the essay where earlier lexical issues persist.
- Grammar: 17/25 - Revised paragraph demonstrates mostly accurate grammar and effective sentence structures. Persistent errors remain elsewhere (comma splices, agreement, articles), and the thesis sentence needs polishing.
- Revised Essay Total: 70/100

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- Overall Improvement: +10 points
- Key Improvements Made:
  - Added a clear, specific example (warehouse operations) to illustrate how automation shifts workers into human-centered roles.
  - Strengthened one topic sentence to directly support the essay’s central claim about long-term employment.
  - Improved sentence clarity and coherence within the revised paragraph (fewer run-ons, more precise vocabulary).
- Missed Opportunities:
  - Finalize and polish the thesis to include precise, compelling reasons (avoid vague points like “unstoppable trend”).
  - Revise the remaining body paragraphs to align with the new thesis and improve grammar, coherence, and evidence (Paragraphs 3 and 4 still contain substantial errors and weak arguments).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- Total Exchanges: 27
- Conversation Quality: Robust, multi-step collaboration. The assistant guided a structured process (thesis → topic sentence → body paragraph), and the student produced multiple drafts culminating in a substantively improved paragraph. The student’s early responses were minimal, but later contributions included full-sentence/topic sentence and a fully revised paragraph with detailed example.

#### Interaction Scores:
- In-Depth Conversation: 4/5 - There were many exchanges with a clear, staged process and progressively deeper content. The assistant asked multi-level questions; the student responded with multiple drafts. More probing questions or reflective comments from the student would reach “excellent.”
- Critical Review of AI Suggestions: 3/5 - The student accepted most suggestions but offered limited explicit justification. Some selective acceptance (e.g., adopting a new topic sentence and refining the paragraph) demonstrates developing critical engagement.
- Refining Process: 4/5 - Clear iterative process: multiple thesis attempts, a refined topic sentence, and a fully revised body paragraph. The thesis was not fully finalized to a polished version, and later paragraphs were not iteratively revised.
- Human-AI Interaction Total: 11/15

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Willingness to iterate: Produced multiple thesis/topic sentence attempts and a substantially improved body paragraph with concrete detail (warehouse example).
- Improved paragraph coherence: The revised Paragraph 2 shows clear logic (mechanism → example → implications) and connects to the overall claim.
- Responsiveness to guidance: Followed a structured process (Step 1–3) and incorporated targeted language improvements (more precise vocabulary and fewer run-ons in the revised paragraph).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Thesis precision and strength: Replace vague reasons (“unstoppable trend,” “mainly performance of AI”) with clearly causal, defensible points (productivity → new industries; complementarity; policy-enabled transitions).
- Global cohesion: Revise all paragraphs to align with the revised thesis, ensuring topic sentences and evidence are consistent across the essay.
- Language accuracy across the entire essay: Systematically fix agreement, articles, punctuation, and avoid comma splices; apply the improved sentence control from Paragraph 2 to the rest of the essay.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Needs Improvement - The course module expects a climate change prompt; the student chose an automation topic instead. Although clarified in chat, this deviates from course context.
- Strategic Planning: Needs Improvement - The assistant led most planning; the student could more actively set goals and outline revision steps for all paragraphs.
- Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement - The student mostly accepted suggestions without articulating reasons for acceptance/rejection.
- Independent Editing: Good - The student produced a high-quality revised body paragraph with specific, relevant detail and clearer prose.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Essay writing: Finalize a concise, reason-led thesis and ensure each paragraph has a focused topic sentence that directly supports it. Add one concrete example per body paragraph and include brief causal explanations (how/why).
2. AI collaboration: Before revising, restate the assignment prompt and your stance, list 2–3 reasons, and propose a quick outline. After feedback, briefly say why you accept or reject suggestions to build critical engagement.
3. Language accuracy: Do a focused edit pass for comma splices, subject–verb agreement, and article use. Aim to replicate the clarity and sentence control shown in your revised Paragraph 2 across the entire essay.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student intentionally shifted away from the course’s climate change prompt to an automation topic, despite multiple reminders. This misalignment may affect task relevance scoring if the assignment requires addressing the climate prompt. However, within the chosen topic, the student completed the module’s revision tasks (thesis, topic sentence, and a full body paragraph) and demonstrated clear improvement in one paragraph’s development and language control.

        **Assistant:** Original:
Automation nowadays is an unstoppable trend ,transforming industries, It can boost efficiency, however, also possibly reduce several jobs, In my opinions , in the long term, this technology shift ultimately enhance global employment prospect.
In the beginning ,the jobs that automation maybe replace almost reply on labors like cleaning, guarding, washing even driving. Automation can reduce these jobs undouble, But we all know that not everyone make a living depending on these jobs. Most of population have their own business, As a result, if those daily work costing a lot of time can be replaced by robots, they will save a lot of time to do another things. They may make more value when they don’t have to care about some cost-time items.
Secondly, we must to pay attention that AI technology is becoming a part of our daily life. After AI’s calculation, which way the most efficient is apparently. To make our hands out, we need to embrace AI. What’s more, the performance form of AI is automation. We believe AI, we believe automation. AI can lead world better, Automation can change the world. We absolutely can not say that with the Apple’s appearance, many workers lose their job. So in the same way, now we are standing at the crest of the fourth industrial revolution, what we should do is embrace the change instead of worrying.
Last but not least, in some ways, automation may reduce the jobs, but may be automation can create new jobs like fixed-time repairer or more regulator. Some new jobs we can not imagine from the perspective of the present day. I do believe the ,in the longer term, it will take a promising future for everyone.


Revised:
Automation nowadays is an unstoppable trend ,transforming industries, It can boost efficiency, however, also possibly reduce several jobs,In the long run, automation enhances global employment because automation is an unstoppable trend , automation is the mainly performance of AI, and automation may motivate some creative jobs.
When machines handle repetitive, time-consuming work like basic cleaning or standard driving routes, workers no longer need to spend hours on tasks that require little skill or creativity—instead, they can be redeployed to roles that rely on human strengths, such as problem-solving, customer interaction, or coordinating complex projects. A concrete example is warehouse operations: robotic systems now manage most sorting, lifting, and inventory transportation, while former low-skill warehouse workers have moved into roles like equipment maintenance (ensuring robots run smoothly), safety oversight (monitoring workflow for risks), or order quality checks (verifying products meet standards). These shifts do not eliminate jobs outright; they simply redirect workers to tasks that add more value to businesses and the economy—since roles focused on human judgment and coordination often improve efficiency, customer satisfaction, and long-term growth, which in turn sustains or expands overall employment opportunities.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:20:09.377Z

**You:** Let's

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:26:02.801Z

**Assistant:** Great to meet you! I’m excited to help you strengthen your essay step by step.

Preliminary Stage — Let’s set targets and diagnose the draft

1) Your goals
- What are your personal goals for this session? For example:
  - Task focus (answering the exact question)
  - Clarity and argument strength
  - Organization and paragraph structure
  - Evidence and development
  - Grammar and style
Which two or three would you like to prioritize today?

2) Important clarification about the topic
- Your draft discusses automation and employment, but the assigned topic is about climate change and whether individual actions are insignificant compared with governments and corporations.
- Do you want to revise your essay to match the climate change prompt? Or did you intend to write about automation for a different task?
Please confirm so we can align the thesis and paragraph we revise.

3) Diagnostic feedback on your current draft (based on Thesis & Argument, Organization, Evidence & Development, Language Use)
Strengths
- You try to present multiple reasons and acknowledge a counterpoint (automation may reduce some jobs).
- You use some signposting (“Secondly,” “Last but not least”).
- You show a clear positive stance (optimism about long-term outcomes).

Areas to improve
- Task relevance: The content is off-topic for the climate change prompt. This is the top issue to fix.
- Thesis & Argument: No clear thesis that directly answers “To what extent do you agree or disagree?”; the stance is vague and hedged (“In my opinions”).
- Organization: Topic sentences don’t clearly link to a thesis; several sentences are run-ons or comma splices.
- Evidence & Development: Examples are vague or not clearly connected to your claim; some examples (e.g., Apple) don’t support the central point clearly.
- Language Use: Frequent grammar and word-choice issues (e.g., “reply” → “rely,” “undouble” → “undoubtedly,” subject–verb agreement, articles, punctuation, and run-on sentences).

4) Please choose your priorities for this session
Since we will revise only the thesis, one body paragraph’s topic sentence, and that paragraph’s content, I recommend:
- Priority 1: Task focus + a clear, confident thesis that answers the climate-change question.
- Priority 2: A strong topic sentence that clearly supports the thesis.
- Priority 3 (micro-focus in sentences we revise): Fix comma splices and subject–verb agreement.

Would you like to go with these three? If not, tell me the two or three targets you prefer.

Before Step 1, I also need your stance
For the climate change prompt, which position would you like to take?
- Largely agree (individual actions are relatively insignificant; systemic action matters most)
- Largely disagree (individual actions are significant and necessary alongside systemic action)
- Mixed view (individual actions alone aren’t enough, but they still matter in important ways)

If helpful, choose 2–3 main points you want your essay to preview. For example:
- How individual actions add up and shift market demand
- How civic actions (voting, lobbying) push governments/corporations
- Why large-scale policy/industry change has greater impact, but relies on public support
- Limits of individual actions without systemic change

Once you confirm your targets and stance, we’ll begin Step 1 — Thesis revision. 
When you’re ready, please:
- Confirm the targets you want to focus on.
- Confirm that we’re revising for the climate change prompt.
- Share a one-sentence attempt at your thesis (your best try). I’ll give you focused feedback and help you strengthen it.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:26:33.472Z

**You:** let

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:26:46.378Z

**Assistant:** Great to meet you! I’m glad you shared your draft. Let’s set clear targets and make a focused plan before we revise.

Your goals
- Which two or three areas would you like to prioritize today?
  - Task focus (answering the exact question)
  - Clarity and argument strength
  - Organization and paragraph structure
  - Evidence and development
  - Grammar and style

Important clarification about the topic
- Your draft discusses automation and employment, but the assigned prompt is about climate change and whether individual actions are insignificant compared with governments and large corporations.
- Would you like to revise your essay to match the climate change prompt? Or was your automation essay for a different task?
Please confirm so we can align your thesis and the paragraph we revise.

Diagnostic feedback on your current draft (Thesis & Argument, Organization, Evidence & Development, Language Use)
Strengths
- You present multiple reasons and acknowledge a counterpoint (automation may reduce some jobs).
- You use signposting (e.g., “Secondly,” “Last but not least”).
- You take a clear overall stance (optimistic about long-term outcomes).

Areas to improve
- Task relevance: The content is off-topic for the climate change prompt; this is the priority to fix.
- Thesis & Argument: The thesis doesn’t directly answer “To what extent do you agree or disagree?” and is hedged (“In my opinions”).
- Organization: Topic sentences don’t clearly link to a central thesis; there are run-ons and comma splices.
- Evidence & Development: Examples are vague or not well connected (e.g., Apple example doesn’t clearly support the claim).
- Language Use: Frequent grammar/word-choice issues (e.g., “reply” → “rely,” “undouble” → “undoubtedly”; subject–verb agreement, articles, punctuation).

Suggested priorities for this session
- Priority 1: Task focus + a clear, confident thesis that answers the climate change question.
- Priority 2: A strong topic sentence that directly supports the thesis.
- Priority 3: Fix common sentence-level issues in the lines we revise (comma splices, subject–verb agreement).

Do these priorities work for you? If you prefer different targets, tell me your top two or three.

Your stance for the climate change prompt
Which position would you like to take?
- Largely agree: Individual actions are relatively insignificant compared to governments/corporations.
- Largely disagree: Individual actions are significant and necessary alongside systemic action.
- Mixed view: Individual actions alone aren’t enough, but they still matter in important ways.

Possible main points you could preview in your thesis (choose 2–3):
- Individual actions scale up and shift market demand.
- Civic actions (voting, advocacy) influence policy and corporate behavior.
- Large-scale policy/industry change has the greatest impact, but public behavior and support make it possible.
- Limits of individual actions without systemic change (e.g., emissions from heavy industry, energy systems).

Once you confirm:
1) your priorities,
2) that we’re revising for the climate change prompt, and
3) your stance,

please share a one-sentence attempt at your thesis (your best try). I’ll respond with focused feedback and help you refine it before we move to the paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:26:59.109Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement In my opinions , in the long term, this technology shift ultimately enhance global employment prospect.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:29:22.511Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing that thesis attempt. Before we accept any thesis revision, let’s finish the preliminary stage so we’re aligned on targets and on the correct prompt.

Quick check on topic
- Your sentence (“In my opinions, in the long term, this technology shift ultimately enhance global employment prospect.”) is about automation and employment.
- The assigned prompt is about climate change and whether individual actions are insignificant compared to governments and corporations.

Would you like to:
A) Revise for the climate change prompt (recommended), or
B) Continue with the automation/employment topic for a different task?

Your priorities for this session
Please choose two or three:
- Task focus (answering the exact question)
- Clarity and argument strength
- Organization and paragraph structure
- Evidence and development
- Grammar and style

Feedback on the sentence you shared (so you can improve whichever topic you choose)
- Off-topic for the climate change question.
- Grammar: “opinions” → “opinion”; “enhance” → “enhances”; “prospect” → “prospects.”
- Punctuation: avoid comma splices; make it one clear sentence.
- Confidence: remove hedging like “In my opinion” if the task requires a firm stance; you can state the claim directly.
- Focus: a strong thesis should also preview your main points (the reasons you’ll develop).

If we are revising for the climate change prompt, please tell me your stance:
- Largely agree (individual actions are relatively insignificant)
- Largely disagree (individual actions are significant)
- Mixed view (individual actions alone aren’t enough, but they still matter)

Then try a one-sentence thesis that:
- Directly answers “To what extent do you agree or disagree?”
- Previews 2–3 reasons you’ll develop.

Example structure (just a guide, not a full rewrite): 
“While [governments/corporations] deliver the largest emissions cuts, individual actions are [significant/limited] because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”

Once you confirm:
1) the topic (climate change vs. automation),
2) your top 2–3 priorities, and
3) your stance,

we’ll proceed to Step 1 and refine your thesis together.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:29:43.713Z

**You:** I want to discuss this topic:Automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. Does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:34:08.498Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic—thanks for clarifying your topic. We’ll focus on: “Automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. Does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term?”

Preliminary Stage — Let’s set targets and diagnose your draft

1) Your goals
Which two or three areas would you like to prioritize today?
- Task focus (answering the exact question)
- Clarity and argument strength
- Organization and paragraph structure
- Evidence and development (clear examples/reasons)
- Grammar and style (word choice, punctuation, run-ons)

2) Diagnostic feedback on your current draft (aligned to the automation topic)
Strengths
- You present a clear overall stance (optimistic about long-term employment).
- You acknowledge a counterpoint (automation may reduce some jobs).
- You use signposting (“Secondly,” “Last but not least”).

Areas to improve
- Thesis & Argument: The thesis isn’t clearly stated in one strong sentence that previews your reasons. The stance is hedged (“In my opinions”), and it doesn’t directly answer the long-term “enhance or undermine” question with clear points.
- Organization: Topic sentences don’t explicitly connect to a clear thesis; there are run-ons and comma splices that blur your logic.
- Evidence & Development: Examples are vague or weakly linked (e.g., Apple reference). The essay would benefit from concrete reasoning or brief historical examples (e.g., past automation waves, new job categories, complementarities with human work).
- Language Use: Frequent issues with word choice and grammar (e.g., “reply” → “rely,” “undouble” → “undoubtedly”), subject–verb agreement, and punctuation.

3) Suggested priorities for this session
- Priority 1: A clear, confident thesis that directly answers the question and previews your reasons.
- Priority 2: A strong topic sentence for one body paragraph that clearly supports the thesis.
- Priority 3 (micro-focus as we revise lines): Fix comma splices and subject–verb agreement.

Do these priorities work for you? If you prefer different targets, tell me your top two or three.

Before Step 1, please choose your stance and main reasons
Which position would you like to take?
- Mostly enhances global employment in the long term
- Mostly undermines global employment in the long term
- Mixed view (net impact depends on policy/education/transition speed)

Choose 2–3 reasons you’d like to preview in your thesis. Some options:
- Productivity growth creates new industries and roles (historical precedent: agriculture, manufacturing, ATMs, software).
- Human–automation complementarity (humans shift to tasks requiring judgment, creativity, social skills).
- Job transformation vs. job loss (reskilling changes roles rather than eliminating them outright).
- Policy and education enable net gains (training, safety nets, transition support).
- Short-term disruption but long-term net growth (time horizon matters; diffusion creates demand).

Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision
Please write your best one-sentence thesis now. Aim to:
- Directly answer the prompt (enhance or undermine in the long term).
- Preview 2–3 reasons.
- Use confident, precise language (no “I think,” “maybe,” “in my opinion”).

Helpful structure you can imitate (but write it in your own words):
“In the long run, automation enhances global employment because it drives productivity that creates new industries, shifts workers into higher-value tasks alongside machines, and—when supported by training and policy—transforms more jobs than it eliminates.”

Your turn: Would you like to try drafting your one-sentence thesis now? Once you share it, I’ll give quick, focused feedback and help you polish it before we move to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:34:29.062Z

**You:** letIn my opinions , in the long term, this technology shift ultimately enhance global employment prospect.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:39:42.087Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing your thesis attempt. I’m glad you’re ready to revise. Before we move to Step 1, let’s quickly confirm our targets and the correct topic so your thesis will be on point.

Quick topic check
- The assigned prompt is about climate change: “Some people believe that individual actions are insignificant compared to governments and corporations. To what extent do you agree or disagree?”
- Your thesis sentence is about automation and employment. Would you like to:
  A) Revise your essay to match the climate change prompt (recommended), or
  B) Continue with the automation/employment topic for a different task?

Your priorities for this session (choose two or three)
- Task focus (answering the exact question)
- Clarity and argument strength
- Organization and paragraph structure
- Evidence and development
- Grammar and style

Brief feedback on your thesis attempt (so you can improve it once we confirm the topic)
- Off-topic for the climate change question (if that’s your assignment).
- Grammar: “opinions” → “opinion”; “enhance” → “enhances”; “prospect” → “prospects.”
- Punctuation: avoid comma splices; make it one clear sentence.
- Confidence: remove hedging like “In my opinion”; state the claim directly.
- Focus: a strong thesis should also preview your main reasons.

If we revise for the climate change prompt, please also tell me your stance:
- Largely agree (individual actions are relatively insignificant)
- Largely disagree (individual actions are significant)
- Mixed view (individual actions alone aren’t enough, but they still matter)

Next step
- Please confirm: the topic (climate change vs. automation) and your top 2–3 priorities.
- Then share your stance for the chosen topic and the 2–3 main reasons you want to preview.
- After that, try a one-sentence thesis again. You can use a simple structure like:
  “In the long term, [claim about the topic] because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”
Would you like to try revising that sentence now? I’ll give focused feedback and help you polish it before we move to the paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:39:57.514Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement In my opinions , in the long term, this technology shift ultimately enhance global employment prospect.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:41:28.210Z

**Assistant:** Great—thanks for sharing that thesis attempt. Before we move to Step 1, let’s quickly complete the preliminary stage so we’re aligned.

Preliminary Stage — Targets, topic, and quick diagnosis

1) Quick topic check
- Your thesis is about automation and employment. Are we revising for the automation/employment topic (not the climate-change prompt)? Please confirm.

2) Your priorities (choose 2–3)
- Task focus (answering the exact question)
- Clarity and argument strength
- Organization and paragraph structure
- Evidence and development (clear reasons/examples)
- Grammar and style (especially run-ons, word choice)

3) Brief diagnosis of your current draft (for the automation topic)
Strengths
- Clear positive stance (long-term employment benefits).
- You present multiple reasons and acknowledge short-term job loss.
- You use some signposting.

Areas to improve
- Thesis isn’t a single, confident sentence that previews reasons.
- Topic sentences don’t clearly connect to a thesis; some run-ons/comma splices.
- Examples/reasons are vague or loosely connected.
- Grammar and word choice (articles, subject–verb agreement, punctuation).

Please reply to confirm:
- We’re working on the automation/employment topic.
- Your top 2–3 priorities from the list.

Once you confirm, we’ll proceed with Step 1 using the thesis you shared.

Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision

Your current thesis draft
“In my opinions, in the long term, this technology shift ultimately enhance global employment prospect.”

Focused feedback
- Confidence: Remove “In my opinion(s).” Your essay is an argument; state it directly.
- Grammar: “opinion” (singular) if you ever use it; “enhances” (subject–verb agreement); “employment prospects” (plural) and add needed articles.
- Clarity: Answer the question directly and preview 2–3 reasons.
- Structure: Make it one clean sentence, not a clause attached to other sentences by commas.

Checklist for a strong thesis
- Directly answers: Does automation enhance or undermine long-term global employment?
- Previews 2–3 reasons you will develop in body paragraphs.
- Uses confident, precise language.
- Is one sentence (no comma splices).

Helpful frame (fill in with your own ideas; this is just a scaffold, not a full rewrite):
“In the long run, automation [enhances/undermines] global employment because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”
Possible reasons you might choose:
- it boosts productivity and creates new industries/roles,
- it shifts workers into higher-value, human-centered tasks alongside machines,
- with training/policy support, more jobs are transformed than eliminated.

Your turn: Would you like to try revising your thesis now using the frame above? Keep it to one sentence and include 2–3 reasons. I’ll give quick feedback and we’ll lock it in before moving to Step 2.

When you’re happy with the thesis, we’ll:
- Step 2: Pick one body paragraph and strengthen its topic sentence so it clearly supports your new thesis.
- Step 3: Revise that paragraph’s supporting sentences for clarity, unity, and coherence.

Over to you:
1) Confirm topic (automation) and your top 2–3 priorities.
2) Share your revised one-sentence thesis (with reasons). Would you like to try it now?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:41:55.228Z

**You:** not the climate change ok?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:59:35.873Z

**Assistant:** Great—thanks for clarifying. We’ll revise your essay on automation and employment, not the climate-change prompt.

Preliminary Stage — Let’s set targets and diagnose your draft

1) Your priorities
Please choose two or three to focus on today:
- Task focus (answering the exact question clearly: enhance or undermine long-term employment)
- Clarity and argument strength
- Organization and paragraph structure
- Evidence and development (clear reasons/examples)
- Grammar and style (word choice, punctuation, run-ons)

2) Quick diagnostic feedback on your draft (automation/employment topic)
Strengths
- Clear overall stance: optimistic about long-term employment outcomes.
- You acknowledge a counterpoint (automation may reduce some jobs).
- You use signposting (“Secondly,” “Last but not least”).

Areas to improve
- Thesis & Argument: The thesis isn’t one clear sentence that directly answers the question and previews your reasons; it’s hedged (“In my opinions”).
- Organization: Topic sentences don’t explicitly connect to a clear thesis; several run-ons/comma splices make ideas hard to follow.
- Evidence & Development: Examples are vague (e.g., Apple) and not tied tightly to the claim.
- Language Use: Word choice and grammar (articles, subject–verb agreement, punctuation) need attention.

3) Your stance and main reasons
Which position do you want to take?
- Mostly enhances global employment in the long term
- Mostly undermines global employment in the long term
- Mixed view (depends on policy/education/transition support)

Choose 2–3 reasons you want your essay to preview. Some options:
- Productivity growth creates new industries and roles.
- Humans shift to higher-value tasks alongside machines (complementarity).
- More jobs are transformed than eliminated when training/policy support is in place.
- Short-term disruption but long-term net gains.

Please reply with:
- Your chosen 2–3 priorities.
- Your stance (enhances/undermines/mixed).
- The 2–3 reasons you want to highlight.

Once you confirm, we’ll begin Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision.

Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision (your turn)
Write your best one-sentence thesis now. Make it:
- Direct: answer the question (enhance or undermine in the long term).
- Preview 2–3 reasons.
- Confident and precise (no “I think,” “maybe,” or “in my opinion”).

Helpful frame you can adapt:
“In the long run, automation [enhances/undermines] global employment because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”

Would you like to try revising your thesis now? I’ll give focused feedback, and once you’re happy with it, we’ll move to Step 2 (choose one body paragraph and strengthen its topic sentence).

*Time:* 2025-12-06T14:59:49.683Z

**You:** In the long run, automation enhances global employment because automation is an unstoppable trend , automation is the mainly performance of AI, and automation may motivate some creative jobs.”Is this ok?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:08:50.642Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing your thesis attempt—great job taking a clear stance. Before we lock it in, can we quickly confirm our priorities for today so we stay focused?
- Proposed priorities: 1) Task focus + a clear, confident thesis, 2) Strong topic sentences that support the thesis, 3) Grammar and style (especially comma splices and word choice).
Does that work for you?

Now, quick feedback on your thesis:
Your sentence: “In the long run, automation enhances global employment because automation is an unstoppable trend, automation is the mainly performance of AI, and automation may motivate some creative jobs.”
What’s working:
- Clear stance: “enhances global employment in the long run.”
- Attempted preview of reasons.

What to improve:
- Reason quality: “unstoppable trend” doesn’t explain why employment improves. “Mainly performance of AI” is unclear. “May motivate some creative jobs” is hedged and vague.
- Language: “the mainly performance of AI” isn’t natural; “may motivate” is weak; avoid repeating “automation” three times.
- Punctuation and parallel structure: avoid the extra space before the comma; make the three reasons parallel and specific.

Stronger reasons you could use (choose 2–3 that fit your argument):
- It raises productivity and creates new industries and roles.
- It complements human skills, shifting workers into higher-value tasks (judgment, creativity, social interaction).
- With training and supportive policies, more jobs are transformed than eliminated.
- It reduces dangerous or repetitive work, freeing time and demand for services.

Your turn: please try rewriting your thesis as one sentence that:
- Answers the question (enhances or undermines in the long run),
- Previews 2–3 clear reasons (choose from above or your own),
- Uses confident language (no “maybe” or “in my opinion”).

Would you like to try revising that sentence now? Once you share your revision, I’ll give quick feedback and, if you’re satisfied, we’ll move to Step 2 (choose one body paragraph and strengthen its topic sentence).

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:09:09.977Z

**You:** In the long run, automation enhances global employment because It complements human skills, shifting workers into higher-value tasks (judgment, creativity, social interaction ,With training and supportive policies, more jobs are transformed than eliminated , and It raises productivity and creates new industries and roles.What about this one?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:16:30.533Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for drafting a new thesis—nice work taking a clear stance.

Quick check before we proceed
- Are you happy to focus on these targets today?
  1) Task focus + a clear, confident thesis
  2) Strong topic sentences that support the thesis
  3) Grammar and style (especially comma splices, word choice)
Please reply “yes” or tell me the two or three priorities you prefer.

Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision
Your attempt:
“In the long run, automation enhances global employment because It complements human skills, shifting workers into higher-value tasks (judgment, creativity, social interaction ,With training and supportive policies, more jobs are transformed than eliminated , and It raises productivity and creates new industries and roles.”

What’s strong
- Clear claim: “enhances global employment in the long run.”
- Three relevant reasons: complementarity, policy-supported transformation, productivity/new industries.

How to strengthen it
- Punctuation: separate the three reasons cleanly; remove the parentheses; fix comma placement.
- Parallel structure: keep the same grammatical pattern for each reason.
- Capitalization: use “it” (lowercase) mid-sentence.
- Concision: the list in parentheses can be integrated smoothly as a phrase.

Model structures you can use as a guide (not for copy-paste—please put it in your own words):
- “In the long run, automation enhances global employment because it complements human skills and shifts workers into higher‑value tasks, raises productivity that creates new industries, and—when supported by training and policy—transforms more jobs than it eliminates.”
- “Over time, automation is a net job creator: it augments human work, boosts productivity and spawns new sectors, and—with reskilling and supportive policies—changes more roles than it replaces.”

Your turn: please revise your sentence now, keeping:
- one sentence,
- three parallel, specific reasons,
- confident, precise language (no parentheses, no “maybe”).

Would you like to try revising that sentence now? I’ll give quick feedback and we’ll lock it in before moving to Step 2.

Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision (once the thesis is set)
Please choose one body paragraph to work on first (Paragraph 2, 3, or 4 in your draft). Copy its topic sentence here. We’ll strengthen it so it clearly supports your revised thesis.

Hints for a strong topic sentence aligned to your thesis
- If you focus on complementarity: “Automation primarily shifts routine tasks to machines, allowing workers to concentrate on judgment, creativity, and social interaction.”
- If you focus on productivity/new industries: “By boosting productivity, automation lowers costs and opens new markets, which generates fresh roles across sectors.”
- If you focus on policy/training: “With targeted training and supportive policies, automation transforms more roles than it eliminates.”

Pick one focus and try writing a clearer topic sentence. I’ll help you refine it.

Step 3 — Revising the Rest of the Chosen Paragraph
Once we improve the topic sentence, we’ll polish the supporting sentences for clarity, unity, and coherence. I’ll ask guiding questions like:
- Do all details directly support the topic sentence?
- Can you add a brief, concrete example (e.g., how ATMs shifted bank staff into customer service and sales)?
- Are there any run-ons or word-choice issues we should fix?

Ready when you are:
1) Confirm today’s priorities (or adjust them).
2) Share your revised one-sentence thesis.
3) Choose a paragraph and post its topic sentence so we can strengthen it.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:16:51.840Z

**You:** let's move to step2

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:32:56.988Z

**Assistant:** Great—happy to move to Step 2. Before we revise a topic sentence, can you quickly confirm the one-sentence thesis you’re using? This helps us make sure the topic sentence links clearly to your central claim.

Quick check
- Please type your final thesis in one sentence. If helpful, use this frame and put it in your own words:
  “In the long run, automation enhances global employment because it complements human skills, raises productivity that creates new industries, and—with training and supportive policies—transforms more jobs than it eliminates.”

Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision
1) Choose one body paragraph to work on (Paragraph 2, 3, or 4 in your draft).
   - Paragraph 2 (about routine jobs being replaced)
   - Paragraph 3 (about AI becoming part of daily life)
   - Paragraph 4 (about new jobs created)

2) Paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence here. For example, Paragraph 2 currently begins with: “In the beginning, the jobs that automation maybe replace almost reply on labors like cleaning, guarding, washing even driving.” If you want to work on this one, copy it here.

3) Let’s strengthen it so it clearly supports your thesis. Aim for a topic sentence that:
   - Connects directly to the thesis (choose one reason: complementarity, productivity/new industries, or policy/training).
   - States the main idea of the paragraph in one clear sentence.
   - Uses confident, precise language (no hedging like “maybe”).

Helpful directions (choose one focus and try a sentence in your own words):
- Complementarity focus: Emphasize how automation shifts routine tasks to machines so humans can focus on higher‑value work.
- Productivity/new industries focus: Emphasize how automation boosts efficiency and opens new markets that create roles.
- Policy/training focus: Emphasize how training/support helps workers transition so more jobs are transformed than lost.

Example models (for inspiration—please write your own version):
- “Automation is steadily taking over repetitive tasks, allowing workers to move into roles that require judgment, creativity, and social skills.”
- “By boosting productivity, automation lowers costs and expands markets, which generates new jobs across sectors.”
- “With targeted training and support, automation changes more roles than it eliminates.”

Your turn: Which paragraph would you like to revise, and what is its current topic sentence? Would you like to try revising that sentence now? I’ll give you focused feedback and help you polish it before we move to Step 3.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:33:15.491Z

**You:** focus on paragragh2n the beginning ,the jobs that automation maybe replace almost reply on labors like cleaning, guarding, washing even driving. Automation can reduce these jobs undouble, But we all know that not everyone make a living depending on these jobs. this is topic sentence

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:36:15.176Z

**Assistant:** Great—thanks for choosing Paragraph 2. We’ll strengthen its topic sentence so it clearly supports your main claim.

Quick check before Step 2
- Please confirm the thesis you’re using so we can align the topic sentence. Are you happy with this version?
“In the long run, automation enhances global employment because it complements human skills, raises productivity that creates new industries, and—with training and supportive policies—transforms more jobs than it eliminates.”
Reply “yes” to confirm, or share your own one-sentence thesis.

Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision for Paragraph 2
You shared: “In the beginning ,the jobs that automation maybe replace almost reply on labors like cleaning, guarding, washing even driving. Automation can reduce these jobs undouble, But we all know that not everyone make a living depending on these jobs. this is topic sentence”

What to improve
- Make it one clear sentence (not multiple).
- Avoid hedging (“maybe”); be confident.
- Use precise wording (“rely,” not “reply”; “manual labor,” not “labors”).
- Link to the thesis idea of complementarity/shift to higher-value work.

Guiding idea
- A strong topic sentence here should say: automation takes over routine, manual tasks, allowing people to move into higher-value roles. That directly supports the “complements human skills” reason in your thesis.

Try one of these structures (then write it in your own words):
- “Automation is increasingly taking over routine, manual tasks such as [1–2 examples], allowing workers to shift into higher‑value roles that require judgment and social skills.”
- “By replacing repetitive, low‑skill tasks like [1–2 examples], automation frees people to focus on higher‑value work, supporting long‑term employment growth.”

Your turn: Please write your revised topic sentence for Paragraph 2 (one sentence, confident, and linked to the thesis). Would you like to try revising that sentence now? I’ll give quick feedback and we’ll lock it in before moving to Step 3.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:36:39.036Z

**You:** Yes and this is my sentence. If ok,can we move to step3 
Automation is increasingly taking over routine, manual tasks such as cleaning and driving, which reduces the need for low-skill labor in these areas but frees workers to shift into higher-value roles that create more long-term economic value—aligning with the idea that this technology ultimately enhances global employment prospects.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:52:20.512Z

**Assistant:** Great progress—thanks for drafting that topic sentence!

Quick feedback on your topic sentence
What’s strong
- Clear focus on routine tasks being automated and how that frees workers to move into higher‑value roles.
- Direct link to your essay’s overall claim about long‑term employment.

One small improvement (optional)
- For concision and smoother flow, you could remove the last clause (“—aligning with the idea … prospects”) because the connection to your thesis is already clear.
- Also, change “which reduces … but frees …” to “which reduces … and frees …” for cleaner parallel structure.

Optional, slightly tighter version (you can keep yours if you prefer)
“Automation is increasingly taking over routine, manual tasks such as cleaning and driving, which reduces the need for low-skill labor in these areas and frees workers to shift into higher‑value roles that create more long‑term economic value.”

Are you happy with your original sentence, or would you like to adopt the tighter version? If you’re satisfied, we’ll move to Step 3 now.

Step 3 — Revise the rest of Paragraph 2
Goal: Make the supporting sentences clearly explain HOW and WHY shifting routine tasks to machines leads to better employment outcomes, with one brief, concrete example.

Your original supporting ideas in Paragraph 2
- Automation reduces certain routine jobs.
- Not everyone relies on those jobs.
- Time saved can be used for “other things” that create more value.

Let’s sharpen and organize those ideas. Try this structure:
1) Explanation (1–2 sentences)
- Clarify the mechanism: when machines handle repetitive tasks, workers can be redeployed to roles that require judgment, customer interaction, coordination, or maintenance.
- Avoid overgeneralizations (e.g., “Most of population have their own business”). Instead, focus on redeployment within firms or transitions supported by training.

2) Example (1–2 sentences)
- Add one brief, specific example. Choose one:
  - ATMs: They reduced cash-handling tasks but bank tellers shifted toward customer service and sales, and bank branches expanded services.
  - Warehouses: Robots handle sorting and lifting, while workers move into inventory control, safety, and equipment maintenance.
  - Cleaning services: Robot vacuums handle basic sweeping, freeing cleaners for specialized tasks like deep sanitation or facilities upkeep.

3) Link-back sentence (1 sentence)
- Tie the example back to your thesis: show that these shifts sustain or grow employment over time.

Language and clarity checklist as you revise
- Replace “reply” with “rely”; “undouble” with “undoubtedly”; “make a living” is the right phrase; “time-consuming tasks” is more natural than “cost-time items.”
- Avoid run-ons/comma splices. Use full stops to separate ideas.
- Use confident verbs (avoid “maybe” in your claims).
- Connect every sentence directly to your topic sentence.

Would you like to try rewriting the supporting part of Paragraph 2 now (3–5 sentences following your topic sentence) using the outline above? Share your version, and I’ll help you refine it line by line.

Updated essay text (including your revised topic sentence)
I’m including the full essay with your new topic sentence inserted, as requested when changes are made. We’ll update this again after you revise the rest of Paragraph 2.

Automation nowadays is an unstoppable trend ,transforming industries, It can boost efficiency, however, also possibly reduce several jobs,In the long run, automation enhances global employment because automation is an unstoppable trend , automation is the mainly performance of AI, and automation may motivate some creative jobs.
Automation is increasingly taking over routine, manual tasks such as cleaning and driving, which reduces the need for low-skill labor in these areas but frees workers to shift into higher-value roles that create more long-term economic value—aligning with the idea that this technology ultimately enhances global employment prospects. Automation can reduce these jobs undouble, But we all know that not everyone make a living depending on these jobs. Most of population have their own business, As a result, if those daily work costing a lot of time can be replaced by robots, they will save a lot of time to do another things. They may make more value when they don’t have to care about some cost-time items.
Secondly, we must to pay attention that AI technology is becoming a part of our daily life. After AI’s calculation, which way the most efficient is apparently. To make our hands out, we need to embrace AI. What’s more, the performance form of AI is automation. We believe AI, we believe automation. AI can lead world better, Automation can change the world. We absolutely can not say that with the Apple’s appearance, many workers lose their job. So in the same way, now we are standing at the crest of the fourth industrial revolution, what we should do is embrace the change instead of worrying.
Last but not least, in some ways, automation may reduce the jobs, but may be automation can create new jobs like fixed-time repairer or more regulator. Some new jobs we can not imagine from the perspective of the present day. I do believe the ,in the longer term, it will take a promising future for everyone.

Your move
- Confirm the topic sentence version you want (your original or the tighter option).
- Then post your revised supporting sentences for Paragraph 2. I’ll give focused feedback to polish them.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T15:53:07.973Z

**You:** When machines handle repetitive, time-consuming work like basic cleaning or standard driving routes, workers no longer need to spend hours on tasks that require little skill or creativity—instead, they can be redeployed to roles that rely on human strengths, such as problem-solving, customer interaction, or coordinating complex projects. A concrete example is warehouse operations: robotic systems now manage most sorting, lifting, and inventory transportation, while former low-skill warehouse workers have moved into roles like equipment maintenance (ensuring robots run smoothly), safety oversight (monitoring workflow for risks), or order quality checks (verifying products meet standards). These shifts do not eliminate jobs outright; they simply redirect workers to tasks that add more value to businesses and the economy—since roles focused on human judgment and coordination often improve efficiency, customer satisfaction, and long-term growth, which in turn sustains or expands overall employment opportunities.Is this ok?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T16:04:16.105Z

**Assistant:** You’ve made strong progress here—nice work. Your paragraph now clearly explains the mechanism (machines take routine tasks; people shift to human‑centered roles) and includes a concrete example (warehouses). It also links back to your thesis. Well done.

A few focused tweaks will make it even clearer and smoother:
- Sentence length: You have two very long sentences. Break them into 3–4 shorter ones to avoid run-ons and improve readability.
- Word choice/tone: Consider “entry‑level warehouse workers” instead of “former low‑skill warehouse workers.”
- Lexical precision: “handle” rather than “manage,” “inventory movement/material handling” rather than “inventory transportation,” and “quality checks on orders” rather than “order quality checks.”
- Punctuation and flow:
  - Split “creativity—instead, they can be redeployed…” into two sentences (creativity. Instead, …).
  - Replace the em dash before “since roles focused on human judgment…” with a full stop; make that a new concluding sentence.

Would you like to try a quick revision using those tweaks? If you prefer, I can apply these light edits for you and then share the updated full essay text.

Quick check on alignment
- Thesis: Are you happy to lock in this version? “In the long run, automation enhances global employment because it complements human skills, raises productivity that creates new industries, and—with training and supportive policies—transforms more jobs than it eliminates.”
- Topic sentence: Do you want the tighter version? “Automation is increasingly taking over routine, manual tasks such as cleaning and driving, which reduces the need for low‑skill labor in these areas and frees workers to shift into higher‑value roles that create more long‑term economic value.”

Your options
A) You revise your three supporting sentences now (using the notes above), and I’ll give quick feedback.
B) I apply the light edits for you and send the updated full essay (with only the thesis, Paragraph 2 topic sentence, and Paragraph 2 content changed).

Which would you prefer?
