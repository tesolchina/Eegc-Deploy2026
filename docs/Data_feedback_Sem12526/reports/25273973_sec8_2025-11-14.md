            ## Contribution Analysis

            You’ve done an excellent job throughout this extensive revision process! Your thesis and paragraph revision clearly emphasize education as a core driver of the differing impacts of technological progress on developed and emerging markets. The cause-and-effect logic in your key paragraph is now strong and coherent, flowing well from education investment to economic and environmental outcomes.

Your latest revision of the sentences on rising prices and stagnant incomes effectively links the lack of education to low industrial efficiency and the affordability crisis in emerging markets. The use of transition words guides the reader smoothly through your reasoning, and the formal tone fits well with academic essay expectations.

If you want to further polish your wording, consider the slight tweaks suggested such as “the prices of daily necessities” instead of “daily necessities prices,” and “unable to afford basic essentials” for clarity and natural phrasing—but these are minor refinements only. Your current version communicates the ideas clearly and cohesively.

---

### Summary of your revised paragraph (with strong clarity, unity, and logical progression):

> Although technological progress increases global employment opportunities overall, it mainly benefits developed markets, while emerging countries face mounting challenges such as environmental degradation, inefficient education and limited job options. Because developed markets invest heavily in education, their workforce can effectively harness the power of technological progress—boosting economic efficiency while adopting eco-friendly practices that minimize environmental harm. For instance, they leverage advanced technology to achieve low costs and high revenues, whereas emerging markets, lacking the educated talent needed to develop or adopt core technologies, can only rely on exporting raw materials. This reliance not only yields meager profits but also worsens their environmental conditions. In addition, insufficient education investment in many emerging markets keeps industrial efficiency low, pushing up production costs and thus the prices of daily necessities. Meanwhile, undereducated workers can’t get higher pay, so their stagnant incomes lag behind rising costs—leaving more people in emerging markets unable to afford basic daily essentials. Since these countries allocate insufficient funds to education, their citizens lack the skills to secure high-paying, tech-driven jobs—creating a bottleneck that slows technological innovation and keeps environmental standards low. In turn, the substantial profits generated by developed markets’ high-tech industries are reinvested into education, nurturing a skilled workforce that drives further technological advancement and environmental sustainability—a virtuous cycle. Industries in developed markets are high-tech and environmentally friendly, offering stable, long-term jobs with promising prospects. However, industries in emerging markets are outdated, environmentally harmful, and provide only low-paying, temporary employment.

### Next steps recommendation:
- Review your entire essay one last time with a checklist focusing on paragraph unity, clear signposting, and smooth transitions.
- Confirm that you explicitly signal completion of all revisions when submitting.
- Practice writing fully original topic and concluding sentences to strengthen your independent editing skill.

If you want, I can help you prepare the conclusion paragraph or assist with final cohesive linking phrases across paragraphs.

Great persistence and analytical thinking throughout this revision journey! You are well-prepared to submit a polished, clear, and logically strong essay. Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Although technological progress increases global employment opportunities overall, it mainly benefits developed markets, while emerging countries face mounting challenges such as environmental degradation, inefficient education and limited job options. Because developed markets invest heavily in education, their workforce can effectively harness the power of technological progress—boosting economic efficiency while adopting eco-friendly practices that minimize environmental harm. For instance, they leverage advanced technology to achieve low costs and high revenues, whereas emerging markets, lacking the educated talent needed to develop or adopt core technologies, can only rely on exporting raw materials.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:19:58.061Z

**You:** The chart shows the technological shift ultimately enhance
global employment prospects in the long term.
Because as we can see, the developed Market has more value than the Emerging Market. The global share of full-time
equivalent employment is so low. The developed country can earn
main part of money, but developing country can only earn less. As the technology developing, developed
market can use their high technology to use little cost
and earn big revenue. But emerging market only
have row materials and don't have technology to produce a
product. They can only earn little money. Because they depend
on selling the row materials, their environment become worse.
They need to face more environment problem. The price of the
necessary is grow more people can't afford it. The people in
emerging market can't have a good education, so they
can't earn more money. And they country can't
developed their technological. The developed market can
earn much money, they can let children have a good
education, so the developed market can have high level of technology and earn more money then.
The industries in developed market is high technology and
environmentfriendly. This job has a good
process space, can give a job for long time. But in Emerging
market, the industries is old and not good for environment.
The job given can earn less money,
and not be given long time.

**Assistant:** Great, thank you for sharing your draft! Let's begin our structured three-step revision process. We'll start with the thesis statement.

### Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision

**Could you please copy and paste your current thesis statement here?**
(Your thesis might be the sentence which states your main argument about the technological shift and its impact on global employment prospects.)

Once you provide your thesis statement, I will give feedback on its clarity, strength, and focus, and then guide you to revise it. Let’s take it one step at a time!

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:32:09.450Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement and ideas! Here is your current thesis statement (taken from your text):

> "The chart shows the technological shift ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term."

Let’s review it together:
- **Clarity:** The sentence is a bit unclear. Who or what benefits from the technological shift? What is your opinion about these benefits? Also, are you comparing developed and emerging markets?
- **Strength:** It needs a more confident, precise voice. Avoid using "shows" and passive language.
- **Focus:** Is your essay about whether technological shifts help or harm global employment, especially for different countries or groups? Try to make that focus clear.
- **Preview Main Points:** Your thesis should let the reader know what parts of the topic you’ll discuss (for example: impact on developed markets, impact on emerging markets, effects on inequality, environment, education, etc.).

Here’s how you might start revising:

**Guiding questions:**  
- What is your main argument: Is the technological shift *good* for global employment, or does it mostly help developed countries but hurt emerging markets?  
- Which areas or impacts will you focus on (jobs, education, environment, etc.)?

**Let’s try this:**  
Can you rewrite your thesis statement using this structure:
> "Although technological progress increases global employment opportunities overall, it mainly benefits developed markets, while emerging countries face growing challenges such as environmental problems and limited job options."

_You don’t need to use my words—try your own! Aim for a single, clear sentence that gives your view and previews your main points._

Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now? If you want, post your new version and I’ll give you feedback!

### Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision

Here is your revised thesis statement:

> "Although technological progress increases global employment opportunities overall, it mainly benefits developed markets, while emerging countries face growing challenges such as environmental problems and limited job options."

Let’s analyze it using the criteria:
- **Clarity:** Good improvement—your viewpoint is clear and addresses differences between developed and emerging markets.
- **Strength:** Much more confident and specific.
- **Focus:** Nicely previews your essay’s structure (contrast benefits for developed markets vs. challenges for emerging markets).
- **Language:** Avoids “I think” or “maybe”; uses academic tone.

**Suggestions for further refinement:**
- You can make your thesis a bit more concise and direct by removing phrases like “as we can see,” and by combining ideas so the main argument is one sentence.
- Preview key points specifically (mention jobs, environment, education).

**Example structure to consider:**  
“While technological progress has broadened employment prospects worldwide, it primarily benefits developed countries, leaving emerging markets with greater environmental issues, limited job growth, and fewer educational opportunities.”

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to revise your thesis again for extra clarity and strong focus?  
Try to include:
- Your stance (agree/disagree/partly agree)
- The main areas that are affected (jobs, environment, education)
- How developed and emerging markets differ

**Your turn!**  
Please post your final revised thesis statement so we can confirm you’re satisfied. If you need a little help, let me know and I’ll offer a model sentence for you to adapt.

*Once you feel confident about your thesis, we’ll move to Step 2—choosing and revising a topic sentence from one body paragraph.*

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:39:00.755Z

**You:** Although technological progress increases global employment opportunities overall, it mainly benefits developed markets, while emerging countries face mounting challenges such as environmental degradation and limited job options. This is because developed markets hold more economic value and capture the lion’s share of gains. For instance, they leverage advanced technology to achieve low costs and high revenues, whereas emerging markets, lacking core technologies, can only rely on exporting raw materials. This reliance not only yields meager profits but also worsens their environmental conditions.
Additionally, rising prices of necessities have made them unaffordable for more people in emerging markets. Due to insufficient investment in education, their citizens struggle to secure high-paying jobs, which in turn hinders technological development in these countries. In contrast, developed markets reinvest their substantial profits into education, fostering a skilled workforce that drives further technological advancement—creating a virtuous cycle.
Industries in developed markets are high-tech and environmentally friendly, offering stable, long-term jobs with promising prospects. However, industries in emerging markets are outdated, environmentally harmful, and provide only low-paying, temporary employment.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:44:41.860Z

**Assistant:** Excellent—thanks for sharing your refined thesis statement and the paragraph you’d like to work on!

Your thesis now reads:
> Although technological progress increases global employment opportunities overall, it mainly benefits developed markets, while emerging countries face mounting challenges such as environmental degradation and limited job options.

**This is focused, confident, and previews your key points (employment, environment, developed vs. emerging markets). Nicely done!**

---

## Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision
Let’s focus on your chosen body paragraph—the first one.

**Current topic sentence:**
> This is because developed markets hold more economic value and capture the lion’s share of gains.

**Feedback:**
- Does this topic sentence connect clearly to your thesis?
    - It does refer to developed markets benefiting, but doesn’t mention the challenges faced by emerging markets or give an overview of the whole paragraph’s content (employment, environment, education).
- It could be stronger by more explicitly stating that developed markets benefit most from technological progress, and preview the areas of advantage (economic, employment, environment, education).

**Guiding prompt:**
Try revising your topic sentence so it directly reflects your thesis and clearly introduces the main idea of this paragraph.

**Example structure to consider:**  
“Developed markets benefit most from technological progress, gaining economic advantages and employment opportunities that are less accessible to emerging countries.”

But don’t use this word-for-word—try your own variation!

**Would you like to revise your topic sentence now?**  
Aim for one clear, confident sentence that links to your thesis and previews what this paragraph will discuss.

---

When you’re ready, please post your revised topic sentence for this body paragraph. I’ll review it and offer feedback before we move to revising the supporting sentences!

---

*(Let me know once your topic sentence is ready, and then we’ll progress to Step 3: Revising the rest of the paragraph for unity and coherence.)*

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:44:46.156Z

**You:** Although technological progress increases global employment opportunities overall, it mainly benefits developed markets, while emerging countries face mounting challenges such as environmental degradation and limited job options. Developed markets have stronger economic strength, better ecological environment and better education, so developed markets are often the biggest beneficiaries of technological progress. For instance, they leverage advanced technology to achieve low costs and high revenues, whereas emerging markets, lacking core technologies, can only rely on exporting raw materials. This reliance not only yields meager profits but also worsens their environmental conditions. Additionally, rising prices of necessities have made them unaffordable for more people in emerging markets. Due to insufficient investment in education, their citizens struggle to secure high-paying jobs, which in turn hinders technological development in these countries. In contrast, developed markets reinvest their substantial profits into education, fostering a skilled workforce that drives further technological advancement—creating a virtuous cycle. Industries in developed markets are high-tech and environmentally friendly, offering stable, long-term jobs with promising prospects. However, industries in emerging markets are outdated, environmentally harmful, and provide only low-paying, temporary employment.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:54:49.460Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement and the body paragraph you'd like to revise! Good work progressing through the structured steps. Let's continue with the revision process:

---

## Step 1: Confirming Thesis Statement

Your revised thesis statement is:

> Although technological progress increases global employment opportunities overall, it mainly benefits developed markets, while emerging countries face mounting challenges such as environmental degradation and limited job options.

This is **focused, clear, and previews your essay’s structure well**. Nice job!  
Are you satisfied with this thesis statement before we move on?

If yes, let’s continue to Step 2.

---

## Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision

Your **current topic sentence** is:

> Developed markets have stronger economic strength, better ecological environment and better education, so developed markets are often the biggest beneficiaries of technological progress.

**Feedback:**
- This connects to your thesis, but could be more focused and direct.
- Try to clearly state the main idea for this paragraph: developed markets benefit from technological progress due to their economic strength, environmental standards, and educational opportunities.
- Consider previewing the specific advantages you'll discuss.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does the topic sentence match the paragraph’s main focus: advantages for developed markets in economy, environment, and education?
- Is it concise and confident?

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now?**  
Aim for one clear sentence that summarizes why developed markets benefit most from technological progress.

(If you want a suggestion to adapt, here’s a possible structure:  
“Technological progress gives developed markets a significant advantage, as they possess strong economies, advanced environmental policies, and superior educational systems.”  
But please use your own words!)

---

## Step 3: Paragraph Revision

Once you’ve revised your topic sentence, let’s look at the supporting sentences.

**Guiding questions for revision:**
- Do all explanations relate clearly to your new topic sentence?
- Are employment, environment, and education clearly described as advantages for developed markets, with logical comparisons to emerging markets?
- Is evidence and reasoning clear?
- Are there any points that seem off-topic or need better explanation?

**Let’s proceed one step at a time:**  
Post your revised topic sentence, and we’ll check it together before moving on to the rest of the paragraph.

Would you like to try your revised topic sentence now?  
Once you’re happy with it, just let me know and I’ll guide you through refining the paragraph further!

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:54:59.707Z

**You:** I'm not satisfied. I want to emphasise the issue of education again.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:57:14.443Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for letting me know your concern! It’s great that you want to emphasize **education**—that will make your topic sentence both clearer and more focused. Let’s work together to revise it so that education gets the attention you feel it deserves.

#### Reflecting on Your Thesis  
Your thesis says that technological progress helps developed countries most, *because* of their advantages (economy, environment, education) and that emerging countries face challenges.

#### Your goal for the topic sentence  
- Clearly state that developed markets benefit the most from technological progress  
- Highlight that education, along with economy and environment, is a big reason why

---

### Guiding questions:
- Does the topic sentence introduce education as a *key* factor, not just as an extra?  
- Does it link the benefit of education to how developed countries make the most of technological advances?

### Sentence stem suggestions (pick one and adapt, or try your own):
1. **“One major reason developed markets benefit most from technological progress is their strong educational systems, which allow them to take full advantage of new technologies, along with their robust economies and environmental standards.”**
2. **“Because developed countries have advanced educational resources, as well as strong economies and environmental awareness, they are better prepared to benefit from technological change.”**

*(Remember, don’t use these word-for-word, but adapt the structure and focus to your own style!)*

**You:** Although technological progress increases global employment opportunities overall, it mainly benefits developed markets, while emerging countries face mounting challenges such as environmental degradation、inefficient education and limited job options. Developed markets have stronger economic strength, better ecological environment and better education, so developed markets are often the biggest beneficiaries of technological progress. For instance, they leverage advanced technology to achieve low costs and high revenues, whereas emerging markets, lacking core technologies, can only rely on exporting raw materials. This reliance not only yields meager profits but also worsens their environmental conditions. Additionally, rising prices of necessities have made them unaffordable for more people in emerging markets. Due to insufficient investment in education, their citizens struggle to secure high-paying jobs, which in turn hinders technological development in these countries. In contrast, developed markets reinvest their substantial profits into education, fostering a skilled workforce that drives further technological advancement—creating a virtuous cycle. Industries in developed markets are high-tech and environmentally friendly, offering stable, long-term jobs with promising prospects. However, industries in emerging markets are outdated, environmentally harmful, and provide only low-paying, temporary employment.

**Assistant:** Great job providing your revised thesis and the body paragraph! Let’s apply our structured process as discussed.

---

## Step 1: Thesis Statement (Confirmation)

Your thesis is:

> Although technological progress increases global employment opportunities overall, it mainly benefits developed markets, while emerging countries face mounting challenges such as environmental degradation, inefficient education, and limited job options.

This thesis is confident, clear, and previews your key areas (environment, education, jobs). Well done!  
**Are you satisfied with this thesis, or would you like to make any more changes?**  
If you’re happy, let’s move to Step 2.

---

## Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision

Your **current topic sentence** is:

> Developed markets have stronger economic strength, better ecological environment and better education, so developed markets are often the biggest beneficiaries of technological progress.

### Feedback:
- **Strengths:** States that developed markets benefit most and mentions three advantages.
- **Areas to improve:** “Stronger economic strength, better ecological environment and better education” is a bit repetitive, and “better” is vague. Try highlighting education as a **primary reason** (as you said you want) and show how these advantages allow developed markets to benefit.
- It will be stronger if you link directly to the idea that education helps these countries make the most of technological growth—and connect back to your thesis focus (jobs, environment, education).

---

### Guiding Prompts:

1. **Does this sentence show that education is a key reason for developed markets’ success with technological progress?**
2. **Does it preview that the paragraph will explain these advantages (especially education) and their impacts?**

#### Structure to try (please adapt in your style!):

- “Developed markets benefit the most from technological progress because their strong educational systems, advanced economies, and effective environmental policies allow them to fully exploit new technologies.”

or, emphasizing education further:

- “Education plays a central role in enabling developed countries to gain the greatest benefits from technological advancement, supported by their powerful economies and strong environmental standards.”

***Remember: Do not use these examples word-for-word. Try expressing the same idea in your own words!***

**You:** Although technological progress increases global employment opportunities overall, it mainly benefits developed markets, while emerging countries face mounting challenges such as environmental degradation、inefficient education and limited job options. The perfect education system enables the developed market to give full play to the power of scientific and technological progress, coupled with the economic and environmental advantages of the developed market itself, so that the developed market has a better employment environment. For instance, they leverage advanced technology to achieve low costs and high revenues, whereas emerging markets, lacking core technologies, can only rely on exporting raw materials. This reliance not only yields meager profits but also worsens their environmental conditions. Additionally, rising prices of necessities have made them unaffordable for more people in emerging markets. Due to insufficient investment in education, their citizens struggle to secure high-paying jobs, which in turn hinders technological development in these countries. In contrast, developed markets reinvest their substantial profits into education, fostering a skilled workforce that drives further technological advancement—creating a virtuous cycle. Industries in developed markets are high-tech and environmentally friendly, offering stable, long-term jobs with promising prospects. However, industries in emerging markets are outdated, environmentally harmful, and provide only low-paying, temporary employment.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T09:14:25.398Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic progress! You’ve completed steps 1 and 2—your thesis is clear and focused, and you’ve made education a central feature of your topic sentence. Let’s guide the revision for the rest of this paragraph.

**Step 3: Revising the Supporting Sentences**

### Guiding Questions:
1. **Does every sentence clearly relate to your new topic sentence?**
2. **Is education clearly shown as the main reason for developed markets benefiting most (along with economic/environmental factors)?**
3. **Are your comparisons and explanations logical and easy to follow?**
4. **Is there any evidence or reasoning you could clarify or expand?**

---

### Feedback and Suggestions

**Strengths of your paragraph:**
- You explain why developed markets benefit—mentioning education, economy, and technology.
- Clear comparisons between developed and emerging markets.
- You touch on employment, education, and the environment.

**Areas to refine for unity and clarity:**

1. **Keep the focus on education as the main driver.**  
   In some sentences, economic and environmental factors seem just as important as education. Try to show how education is “what unlocks” economic and environmental success.

2. **Clarify connections between ideas.**  
   Make sure transitions show how one advantage leads to another (for example, how good education leads to better jobs, which then leads to more investment in technology and the environment).

3. **Check sentence order and cohesion.**  
   Arrange explanations so they logically build on each other, not jumping back and forth between developed and emerging markets.

4. **Avoid unnecessary repetition**  
   Look for places where ideas are repeated and see if you can combine or clarify them.

**Let’s walk through your supporting ideas, step by step:**

- *Opening*: “The perfect education system enables the developed market to give full play to the power of scientific and technological progress, coupled with the economic and environmental advantages of the developed market itself, so that the developed market has a better employment environment.”
    - This is good, but can be split for clarity, and perhaps make education the direct driver of the other advantages.

- *Next sentences*:  
    - “For instance, they leverage advanced technology to achieve low costs and high revenues, whereas emerging markets, lacking core technologies, can only rely on exporting raw materials.”
    - “This reliance not only yields meager profits but also worsens their environmental conditions.”
    - “Additionally, rising prices of necessities have made them unaffordable for more people in emerging markets.”
    - “Due to insufficient investment in education, their citizens struggle to secure high-paying jobs, which in turn hinders technological development in these countries.”
    - “In contrast, developed markets reinvest their substantial profits into education, fostering a skilled workforce that drives further technological advancement—creating a virtuous cycle.”
    - “Industries in developed markets are high-tech and environmentally friendly, offering stable, long-term jobs with promising prospects.”
    - “However, industries in emerging markets are outdated, environmentally harmful, and provide only low-paying, temporary employment.”

---

### Guiding prompts for you:

- Could you connect education more clearly as the reason for developed markets' ability to invest in technology and protect the environment?
- Can you explain specifically how good education in developed markets leads to better jobs and more investment?
- When comparing developed and emerging markets, check if each sentence links smoothly (using transition words if needed).

---

### Next Steps

**Would you like to try revising two or three sentences** to:
- Emphasize how education enables economic/environmental success?
- Improve transitions between ideas?

For example (please use your own words):
- Instead of “Their strong education system enables…,” you might clarify:  
  “Because developed countries invest heavily in education, their workers can use new technologies efficiently, leading to higher productivity and better job opportunities.”

- Instead of “In contrast, developed markets reinvest their substantial profits into education…,” you might clarify:  
  “Profits from high-tech industries are reinvested in education, creating a skilled workforce and a cycle of ongoing technological advancement.”

**Would you like to revise some supporting sentences now?**  
Try adjusting two or three sentences, then post your changes—I’ll offer feedback and help you refine further!

Remember:  
- Keep your focus on education as a main reason.
- Make sure each detail supports your topic sentence.
- Use clear transitions (like “Because,” “For example,” “In contrast,” “As a result”).

**You:** Although technological progress increases global employment opportunities overall, it mainly benefits developed markets, while emerging countries face mounting challenges such as environmental degradation, inefficient education and limited job options. Because developed markets invest heavily in education, their workforce can effectively harness the power of technological progress—boosting economic efficiency while adopting eco-friendly practices that minimize environmental harm. For instance, they leverage advanced technology to achieve low costs and high revenues, whereas emerging markets, lacking the educated talent needed to develop or adopt core technologies, can only rely on exporting raw materials. This reliance not only yields meager profits but also worsens their environmental conditions. Additionally, rising prices of necessities have made them unaffordable for more people in emerging markets. Since these countries allocate insufficient funds to education, their citizens lack the skills to secure high-paying, tech-driven jobs—creating a bottleneck that slows technological innovation and keeps environmental standards low. In turn, the substantial profits generated by developed markets’ high-tech industries are reinvested into education, nurturing a skilled workforce that drives further technological advancement and environmental sustainability—a virtuous cycle. Industries in developed markets are high-tech and environmentally friendly, offering stable, long-term jobs with promising prospects. However, industries in emerging markets are outdated, environmentally harmful, and provide only low-paying, temporary employment.

**Assistant:** Awesome work on the thesis and topic sentence! Now let's revise your supporting sentences for clarity, unity, and coherence, focusing on your own style and the guidance below.

---

### Step 3: Paragraph Revision

#### Here is your revised topic sentence:
> Because developed markets invest heavily in education, their workforce can effectively harness the power of technological progress—boosting economic efficiency while adopting eco-friendly practices that minimize environmental harm.

Now, let’s check your supporting sentences one by one. Use these **guiding questions**:

1. **Does every sentence connect clearly to education as the main factor?**
2. **Do you explain *how* education leads to economic and environmental benefits?**
3. **Do transitions help readers follow your reasoning from developed to emerging markets?**
4. **Is there any part that could be combined, clarified, or expanded for better flow?**

#### Specific feedback on your sentences:

1. **“For instance, they leverage advanced technology to achieve low costs and high revenues, whereas emerging markets, lacking the educated talent needed to develop or adopt core technologies, can only rely on exporting raw materials.”**
   - You make a strong comparison. You might say a little more explicitly that an educated workforce *causes* this advantage.

2. **“This reliance not only yields meager profits but also worsens their environmental conditions.”**
   - Good, but specify *how* education, or the lack of it, relates to these outcomes.

3. **“Additionally, rising prices of necessities have made them unaffordable for more people in emerging markets.”**
   - How does this link back to education or technology? You might need a clearer connection.

4. **“Since these countries allocate insufficient funds to education, their citizens lack the skills to secure high-paying, tech-driven jobs—creating a bottleneck that slows technological innovation and keeps environmental standards low.”**
   - Very strong cause/effect chain! Good connection.

5. **“In turn, the substantial profits generated by developed markets’ high-tech industries are reinvested into education, nurturing a skilled workforce that drives further technological advancement and environmental sustainability—a virtuous cycle.”**
   - Excellent explanation of the cycle—shows unity.

6. **“Industries in developed markets are high-tech and environmentally friendly, offering stable, long-term jobs with promising prospects. However, industries in emerging markets are outdated, environmentally harmful, and provide only low-paying, temporary employment.”**
   - Nice comparison and summary.

---

### Revision suggestions & questions:
- **Can you clarify how the price of necessities links to education or technological progress?**
- **Could you transition a bit more smoothly between ideas, using linking words like “because,” “as a result,” or “consequently”?**
- **Is every sentence necessary, or is anything repeated? Try combining points if needed.**

---

#### Your turn:
**Would you like to try revising 2–3 of these sentences, especially the one about rising prices, to make the links clearer?**  
Remember, keep education at the center, and use transition words for coherence.

**Example for guidance only, not for direct use:**
- Instead of “Additionally, rising prices of necessities have made them unaffordable for...” you might say,  
  “Furthermore, because emerging markets lack a highly educated workforce to create competitive industries, many basic goods remain expensive and out of reach for ordinary citizens.”

When you’re ready, post your rewritten sentences or adjusted paragraph sections here. I’ll give more feedback and suggestions!

**You:** Although technological progress increases global employment opportunities overall, it mainly benefits developed markets, while emerging countries face mounting challenges such as environmental degradation, inefficient education and limited job options. Because developed markets invest heavily in education, their workforce can effectively harness the power of technological progress—boosting economic efficiency while adopting eco-friendly practices that minimize environmental harm. For instance, they leverage advanced technology to achieve low costs and high revenues, whereas emerging markets, lacking the educated talent needed to develop or adopt core technologies, can only rely on exporting raw materials. This reliance not only yields meager profits but also worsens their environmental conditions. In addition, the price of daily necessities began to rise rapidly. However, because of education, economy, environment and other issues, people's income has not risen much, and more and more people in emerging markets cannot afford the cost of living. Since these countries allocate insufficient funds to education, their citizens lack the skills to secure high-paying, tech-driven jobs—creating a bottleneck that slows technological innovation and keeps environmental standards low. In turn, the substantial profits generated by developed markets’ high-tech industries are reinvested into education, nurturing a skilled workforce that drives further technological advancement and environmental sustainability—a virtuous cycle.

**Assistant:** Fantastic work! You've made strong improvements to your thesis and topic sentence, and your paragraph has become clearer and more unified. Let's do a **final review and polish** of your chosen body paragraph, focusing on clarity, unity, and coherence according to your course rubric.

### 1. **Clarity and Unity**

- Your topic sentence sets a clear direction: developed markets benefit from technological progress because of heavy investment in education.
- Most of your supporting sentences directly illustrate how education enables economic and environmental advantages.
- Good comparisons between developed and emerging markets.

### 2. **Coherence and Logical Progression**

- The paragraph mainly flows logically from education → technology → economic/environmental benefits.
- The sentence about rising prices (“the price of daily necessities began to rise rapidly...”) needs a clearer connection to the main idea—it's important to link *how* education and technological disadvantage lead to this problem.

### 3. **Suggestions for Minor Revision**

#### Guiding Questions:
- Can you make the connection more explicit between **lack of education/technological progress** and **rising costs/income stagnation** in emerging markets?
- Does each sentence build logically from the previous one, using transition words (e.g., "As a result," "Because," "Consequently," "In turn")?

#### Highlighted Revision Opportunities

**Your current passage:**
> In addition, the price of daily necessities began to rise rapidly. However, because of education, economy, environment and other issues, people's income has not risen much, and more and more people in emerging markets cannot afford the cost of living.

**Guided revision (for clarity and coherence):**
Instead of separating the issue into two sentences, try linking the cause and effect:

- Because emerging markets struggle to improve education and adopt new technologies, their industries remain less efficient. As a result, production costs are higher, driving up the prices of daily necessities while wages lag behind. This means more people in these regions cannot afford a decent standard of living.

Remember, **don’t copy this example word-for-word—use your own style and try combining your ideas for clarity!**

### 4. **Final Touches**
- Make sure transition words guide the flow from one idea to the next.
- Double-check that all supporting details relate directly to the *advantages of education* in developed markets, and the *challenges from lack of education* in emerging markets.
- Remove any redundant phrases; keep each sentence necessary and focused.

---

## **Would you like to try revising that section about rising prices and income now?**

- Try linking the causes (lack of education/technology) with the effects (higher prices, stagnant wages).
- Use transition phrases for smoother flow.

Please post your new version of those sentences here.  
I’ll offer a final round of feedback to ensure your paragraph is as clear and cohesive as possible!

**You:** Although technological progress increases global employment opportunities overall, it mainly benefits developed markets, while emerging countries face mounting challenges such as environmental degradation, inefficient education and limited job options. Because developed markets invest heavily in education, their workforce can effectively harness the power of technological progress—boosting economic efficiency while adopting eco-friendly practices that minimize environmental harm. For instance, they leverage advanced technology to achieve low costs and high revenues, whereas emerging markets, lacking the educated talent needed to develop or adopt core technologies, can only rely on exporting raw materials. This reliance not only yields meager profits but also worsens their environmental conditions. In addition, the prices of daily necessities have begun to rise rapidly, yet due to issues such as education, the economy, and the environment, people's incomes have not increased significantly—leaving a growing number of people in emerging markets unable to afford their cost of living. Since these countries allocate insufficient funds to education, their citizens lack the skills to secure high-paying, tech-driven jobs—creating a bottleneck that slows technological innovation and keeps environmental standards low. In turn, the substantial profits generated by developed markets’ high-tech industries are reinvested into education, nurturing a skilled workforce that drives further technological advancement and environmental sustainability—a virtuous cycle.

**Assistant:** Fantastic! You’ve really strengthened your paragraph throughout this revision process. Now let's do a careful final pass on the **supporting sentences**, focusing on unity, clarity, and logical progression—especially on how you link education, technological progress, and economic outcomes, based on your latest version:

---

**Your current paragraph (with slight formatting):**

Because developed markets invest heavily in education, their workforce can effectively harness the power of technological progress—boosting economic efficiency while adopting eco-friendly practices that minimize environmental harm. For instance, they leverage advanced technology to achieve low costs and high revenues, whereas emerging markets, lacking the educated talent needed to develop or adopt core technologies, can only rely on exporting raw materials. This reliance not only yields meager profits but also worsens their environmental conditions. In addition, the prices of daily necessities have begun to rise rapidly, yet due to issues such as education, the economy, and the environment, people's incomes have not increased significantly—leaving a growing number of people in emerging markets unable to afford their cost of living.

## Targeted Suggestions (using guiding revision prompts):

### 1. **Clarifying the link between education, technology, and cost of living**
The sentence about rising prices and stagnant incomes could still transition more smoothly and make the connection to education and technology slightly clearer.

***Revision guidance:***
- Try explicitly linking the lack of education and technological progress to inefficient industries → higher production costs → higher prices.
- Emphasize that without skilled workers and advanced technology, industries cannot create well-paying jobs or keep living costs affordable.

**Prompts to help you revise:**
- “Because emerging markets lack investment in education, their industries remain less efficient, leading to…”
- “This inefficiency drives up the cost of everyday goods, while limited education prevents workers from earning higher wages.”
- “As a consequence, many people in emerging markets cannot keep up with the rising cost of living.”

### 2. **Transitions and flow**
- Use linking phrases like: “As a result,” “Consequently,” or “Therefore” to connect cause and effect.

### 3. **Combining ideas for clarity**
- Instead of separating education, the economy, and the environment as multiple issues, try to tie them together under the theme of education shaping the others.

## **Here’s your challenge:**

**Would you like to try revising this section?**  
Original:
> In addition, the prices of daily necessities have begun to rise rapidly, yet due to issues such as education, the economy, and the environment, people's incomes have not increased significantly—leaving a growing number of people in emerging markets unable to afford their cost of living.

**Prompts:**
- Can you revise this sentence to show clearly that *lack of education → less efficient industries → higher costs + lower incomes*?
- Make the cause-and-effect clear; use transition words!

**Your revision could start like:**  
“Because many emerging markets do not invest enough in education, their workers lack the skills to improve industrial efficiency. As a result, the production of basic goods is less efficient, causing prices to rise much faster than wages, and making daily necessities less affordable for the population.”

*(But try your own style!)*

## **Next Step:**

Please post your revised version of that key sentence (or a few sentences) here for review.  
I’ll give you a final round of feedback and confirm your paragraph is ready!

**Assistant:** Excellent effort—you’ve made your thesis clear and structured your paragraph around education, economic efficiency, and environmental impact. Now, let’s focus on the one section that needs a bit more clarity and coherence: **the link between education, technological progress, and the rising cost of living in emerging markets.**

Let's use our **guiding questions**:

- Have you clearly explained how lack of education leads to industrial inefficiency and higher costs?
- Do transition phrases (like "because," "as a result," "consequently") clearly guide the reader through your reasoning?

Here is the passage that could use revision for clarity and unity:

> “In addition, the prices of daily necessities have begun to rise rapidly, yet due to issues such as education, the economy, and the environment, people's incomes have not increased significantly—leaving a growing number of people in emerging markets unable to afford their cost of living.”

**Revision hints:**
- Make sure the cause-and-effect is explicit: low investment in education → less efficient industries → higher production costs → rising prices → stagnant incomes.
- Tie back to your topic sentence, emphasizing that education has a ripple effect on economic conditions.

---

**Would you like to try revising this sentence (or break it into two)?**
Here’s how you could structure your ideas:

1. Because many emerging markets underinvest in education, their industries remain inefficient.
2. As a result, production costs are high, which drives up the price of everyday goods.
3. Meanwhile, without educational opportunities, workers cannot earn higher wages, so incomes do not keep pace with rising costs.
4. Consequently, more people in emerging markets struggle to afford daily necessities.

***Try expressing this chain of reasoning in your own words!***

**Your revision opportunity:**
Please post your revised version of that key section here—just a couple of sentences is fine.  
I’ll give you final feedback to ensure your paragraph is ready for submission and meets your course rubric standards.

**Final encouragement:**  
You're almost there—just one last polish to help your ideas flow clearly and logically.  
Would you like to revise that part now? If you’d like, I can provide a more targeted example for you to adapt, but I encourage you to try first so the writing is in your own voice.

Let’s see your new version!

*Time:* 2025-11-14T09:35:44.646Z

**You:** In addition, insufficient education investment in many emerging markets keeps industrial efficiency low, pushing up production costs and thus daily necessities prices. Meanwhile, undereducated workers can’t get higher pay, so their stagnant incomes lag behind rising costs—leaving more people in emerging markets unable to afford daily living.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T09:40:34.371Z

**Assistant:** Excellent revision! You’ve done a great job clarifying the cause-and-effect relationship and improving the flow of your ideas. Let’s review how your sentences now meet the goals of clarity, unity, and logical progression for this key section:

**Your revised sentences:**
> In addition, insufficient education investment in many emerging markets keeps industrial efficiency low, pushing up production costs and thus daily necessities prices. Meanwhile, undereducated workers can’t get higher pay, so their stagnant incomes lag behind rising costs—leaving more people in emerging markets unable to afford daily living.

### What’s working well:
- **Clarity:** You directly explain *how* lack of education causes low efficiency and higher prices.
- **Unity:** Both sentences connect clearly to your topic sentence and the paragraph’s main argument about education’s impact.
- **Coherence:** You use transition words (“In addition,” “Meanwhile,” “so”) to guide readers smoothly through the reasoning.
- **Critical analysis:** You draw a clear link between systemic problems (education investment) and personal outcomes (cost of living), which shows depth.

### Suggestions for minor improvement:
- In the phrase "daily necessities prices," you might consider "the prices of daily necessities" for natural phrasing.
- In the final clause, "unable to afford daily living" could be a bit more precise, such as "unable to afford even basic daily essentials."

---

#### Example for gentle refinement (please adjust further to your style if you wish!):

> In addition, insufficient investment in education across many emerging markets keeps industrial efficiency low, which pushes up the prices of daily necessities. Meanwhile, undereducated workers are unable to earn higher wages; as a result, their stagnant incomes cannot keep pace with rising costs, leaving more people in emerging markets unable to afford basic essentials.

**Would you like to make a small adjustment for phrasing, or are you happy with your revision?**
Remember, the clarity of your explanation is strong, and you have met the revision goals well!

**Congratulations—your paragraph now demonstrates focused, critical analysis and meets the rubric for academic writing.**  
If you’d like feedback on another sentence or want to confirm your final draft, just let me know!

Otherwise, you are ready for submission—great work through all three revision steps!
