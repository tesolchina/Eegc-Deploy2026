            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for your thoughtful work so far! Let’s move forward with revising the two key sentences you chose in Paragraph 2. This focused revision will help your argument be clearer and more precise.

---

### Please try revising these two sentences now:

**1) Birth rate and Japan example — rewrite clearly and concisely:**
Try something like:  
*“In recent years, birth rates have declined sharply in many developed countries. Japan, for example, faces a serious shortage of young workers due to its extremely low birth rate.”*

Feel free to use that draft or create your own version that is clear, grammatically correct, and concise.

**2) Concluding sentence that links legal protections to retention and labour shortage solutions:**  
Try to write a sentence that shows cause and effect, e.g.:  
*“Therefore, stronger legal protections make migrant workers feel safer and more valued, encouraging them to stay and helping to fill critical labour shortages.”*

---

**Please paste your revised versions of these two sentences.** I’ll give you focused feedback and help with polishing them further before you integrate them fully into your paragraph.

If you prefer, I can provide model versions to edit instead—just let me know!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The essay has a clear position and two relevant reasons (cultural exchange/global mindset and labour shortages) but ideas are general and underdeveloped. Example: "First, migrant workers are the most important source for residents to enhance their global mindset..." is a claim with little development.
- Organization: 17/25 - Basic paragraph structure with two body paragraphs, but the introduction lacks a concise thesis that previews the points; transitions are weak (“Here are the reasons.”).
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Repetition and awkward phrasing reduce clarity (e.g., “shrink of young labours,” “globalisation on Earth is establishing quickly”).
- Grammar: 15/25 - Frequent errors (possessives, articles, word order) that impede clarity: “those workers rights” (should be “workers’ rights”), “As they suffering from lack of young labour force…”.
- **Original Essay Total: 65/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised draft improves specificity of the two reasons and connects protections to cultural exchange and labour shortages (e.g., “...preserves cultural exchange that strengthens locals’ global mindset and helps fill critical labour shortages”). Still needs stronger evidence and more concise claims.
- Organization: 20/25 - Topic sentences are clearer and align more closely to the reasons. However, the introduction/thesis in the revised essay remains the weaker original phrasing and does not preview the points effectively.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Vocabulary choices are improved and more academic in places (e.g., “adopt stronger legal protections”), but there are still awkward collocations and some repetition.
- Grammar: 19/25 - Grammar and sentence structure have improved (more complex sentences appear), but errors remain: inconsistent articles/word forms and some awkward sentences persist (e.g., “In the recent years, birth rate has been declining vigorously…”).
- **Revised Essay Total: 80/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +15 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Topic sentences and paragraph focus were clarified (e.g., paragraph 2 begins: “By guaranteeing legal rights and safety, governments can encourage migrant workers to remain…”).
  - The second body paragraph was expanded with clearer causal logic (legal protections → retention → mitigate shortages).
  - More formal, academic language used in places (“adopt stronger legal protections,” “alleviate severe workforce gaps”).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The introduction/thesis was not replaced with a single concise thesis that previews the two reasons — the revised essay still opens with the original weak thesis (“Some may claim... However, I cannot agree with them. Here are the reasons.”).
  - Lack of concrete evidence or specific statistics to support claims (e.g., cite numbers or sectors affected).
  - Remaining grammatical and stylistic issues (article usage, pluralization, awkward adverbs) need further editing.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 13** (13 messages in the provided chat log; multiple assistant prompts and student replies).
- **Conversation Quality:** Focused, structured, and goal-directed. The assistant used a three-step revision plan and offered explicit models. The student selected targets (strengthen argument, work on paragraph 2, accept Model 2 topic sentence) and followed through. The student did not, however, implement a revised thesis in the final essay despite assistant guidance.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 4/5 - The chat shows a focused, multi-step interaction with clear scaffolding from the assistant and repeated decisions from the student (e.g., choosing to strengthen reasons, selecting paragraph 2, selecting Model 2). The exchange is substantial though not as long as the "extensive" category.
  - Evidence: assistant provided stepwise plan, two thesis examples, three model topic sentences, and stepwise guidance for paragraph revision.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - The student actively made choices among AI suggestions (chose Example 1 as working thesis to skip revising it at that time; later chose Model 2 for topic sentence). The student accepted and applied many suggestions but did not demonstrate deep critique or rejection of suggestions beyond choosing options.
  - Evidence: user replied "1. yes 2.paragraph. 3. B. yes. enhance local people's global mindset and replace the lack of labour force." and later "model 2", indicating selection and partial adoption.
- **Refining Process**: 4/5 - There is evidence of iteration: the assistant requested drafts, offered models, and the student revised paragraphs in the revised essay. However, the full three-step cycle (revise thesis → revise topic sentence → revise paragraph) was not completed because the thesis was not updated in the revised essay.
  - Evidence: assistant’s plan (Step 1–3) and the student’s application to paragraph 2; the revised essay shows paragraph rewrites and improved topic sentences.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 12/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear stance and two coherent reasons were present from the start and were developed further in revision (evidence: both essays argue protections preserve cultural exchange and address labour shortages).
- Effective use of the assistant’s structured process: the student clearly answered the assistant’s guided prompts and followed model suggestions (e.g., chose Model 2 and adopted its theme in paragraph 2).
- Improved topic sentences and clearer causal language in the revised body paragraphs (quote: “By guaranteeing legal rights and safety, governments can encourage migrant workers to remain and thus alleviate severe workforce gaps in key industries.”).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Thesis statement: rewrite as one concise sentence that directly answers the task and previews the two main reasons. The revised essay still uses the original weak introduction (“Some may claim... However, I cannot agree with them. Here are the reasons.”).
- Evidence and specificity: include data, concrete sector examples, or citations to support claims (e.g., which sectors face shortages, numeric examples).
- Grammar and proofreading: address remaining issues (possessives, articles, verb forms, awkward adverbs) to improve clarity and correctness.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student clearly stated revision goals early (“Make my argument stronger”) and selected which paragraph to work on.
  - Evidence: Chat messages where student chose targets and paragraph 2.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student followed a structured plan and selected model responses to apply.
  - Evidence: Student accepted stepwise approach and chose Model 2 for the topic sentence.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Developing - The student made choices among AI suggestions but did not deeply critique or adapt the thesis suggestion; some acceptance was uncritical.
  - Evidence: Student skipped thesis revision (chose to use Example 1 as working thesis but did not integrate it into the revised essay).
- **Independent Editing**: Good - Student implemented substantive paragraph-level revisions and clearer topic sentences, showing independent application of AI guidance.
  - Evidence: Revised paragraph 2 and updated topic sentences in the revised essay.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise the thesis now: write one concise sentence that directly answers the prompt and previews the two reasons (use the assistant’s Example 1 or 2 as a model, then integrate it into the introduction).
2. Add specific evidence: include at least one concrete example or statistic (e.g., labour shortage percentages or a cited sector in a named country) to strengthen claims and move from assertion to evidence-based argument.
3. Do a focused grammar pass: correct possessives (“workers’ rights”), pluralization, article use, and simplify awkward phrases. Read sentences aloud or use sentence-level AI checks, then re-edit manually.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student engaged productively with the AI and improved paragraph-level clarity and topic sentences but did not complete the planned thesis revision. The instructor may require the student to submit a final version with an updated thesis and one additional round of proofreading.
- Encourage the student to include concrete evidence and to perform a final pass for grammar and coherence before submission.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Exploitation in migrant workers is always a complicated issue because of varied factors. For example, weak regulations, enduring long hours and unfair pay. Some may claim that the government should not enforce stricter laws to protect those workers rights because the government should always put the local workers in the priority. However, I cannot agree with them.
Here are the reasons.

First, migrant workers are the most important source for residents to enhance their global mindset as the locals can interact with people from different countries in their place. Nowadays, global mindset becomes more and more important for every global citizen as globalisation on Earth is establishing quickly. Hence, stricter laws to protect migrant workers rights can avoid them from leaving the country they used to work in. The presence of migrant workers benefits the local workers.

Second, migrant workers can replace the shrink of young labours. In the recent years, birth rate has been declining vigorously among developed countries. Japan is one of the significant example. As they suffering from lack of young labour force seriously because of the extremely low birth rate in Japan, they urgently require a large amount of it. The migrant workers can hence perfectly tackle this kind of issue. Hence the government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers rights for the sake of rescuing their labour force especially those countries with low birth rate as stricter laws can let the migrant workers feel safe and stay to work in a foreign country.

In conclusion, enforcement of strict laws to safeguard the migrant workers is beneficial for the foreign workers, local workers and even the whole country. Every stakeholder should be aware of this kind of issue in order to grasp the advantages bring from migrant workers.


Revised:
Exploitation in migrant workers is always a complicated issue because of varied factors. For example, weak regulations, enduring long hours and unfair pay. Some may claim that the government should not enforce stricter laws to protect those workers rights because the government should always put the local workers in the priority. However, I cannot agree with them.
Here are the reasons.

First, governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers because doing so preserves cultural exchange that strengthens locals’ global mindset. Nowadays, global mindset becomes more and more important for every global citizen as globalisation on Earth is establishing quickly. Hence, stricter laws to protect migrant workers rights can avoid them from leaving the country they used to work in. The presence of migrant workers benefits the local workers.

Second, governments must adopt stronger legal protections for migrant workers to address labour shortages that threaten key sectors of the economy. By guaranteeing legal rights and safety, governments can encourage migrant workers to remain and thus alleviate severe workforce gaps in key industries. In the recent years, birth rate has been declining vigorously among developed countries for example like Japan. As they suffering from lack of young labour force seriously because of the extremely low birth rate in Japan, they urgently require large numbers of workers. The migrant workers can hence perfectly tackle this kind of issue. Hence the government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers rights for the sake of rescuing their labour force especially those countries with low birth rate. Therefore, stronger protections make migrant workers more likely to stay, helping to fill labour shortages.

In conclusion, enforcement of strict laws to safeguard the migrant workers is beneficial for the foreign workers, local workers and even the whole country. Every stakeholder should be aware of this kind of issue in order to grasp the advantages bring from migrant workers.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:39:49.445Z

**You:** let's revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:44:23.779Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m glad you want to focus on the thesis. Before we jump in, let’s do the quick negotiating + diagnostic steps so we have clear targets.

1) Quick goals check
Which of these would you most like to improve today? (Pick one or two.)
- Make my thesis clearer and more specific
- Make my argument stronger (give clearer reasons)
- Improve grammar and word choice in the introduction
- Improve paragraph structure and linking between points

2) Brief diagnostic feedback (based on the rubric categories)
- Content & Ideas: Developing. Your essay has a clear position (you disagree with the view that governments shouldn’t act), but the reasons are general and need clearer, more precise claims.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Developing. You have two body paragraphs with relevant ideas, but the essay would benefit from a thesis that previews those two reasons so readers know the structure from the start.
- Vocabulary: Developing. Some repetition and awkward word choices (e.g., “shrink of young labours,” “globalisation on Earth is establishing quickly”).
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Basic–Developing. There are errors and awkward phrases that reduce clarity (e.g., missing possessive apostrophes, subject-verb problems, and run-on sentences).

Strengths to keep: You have a clear overall stance and two coherent reasons (migrant workers help local/global mindset; they address labor shortages). Those are good building blocks.

3) Choose revision priorities
Do you want to focus only on the thesis now, or thesis plus one of these: clarity of reasons, or fixing grammar in the introduction? (Confirm exactly what you want to work on before we start Step 1.)

Once you confirm “thesis only” (or thesis + something), we’ll move to Step 1.

Step 1 — Thesis feedback and revision (I’ll start once you confirm)
- Current thesis in your draft: “Some may claim that the government should not enforce stricter laws to protect those workers rights because the government should always put the local workers in the priority. However, I cannot agree with them. Here are the reasons.”
- Quick feedback: This is understandable but weak. It doesn’t clearly answer the question in one concise sentence, and it doesn’t preview the main points. It also has grammar problems (“those workers rights” → “those workers’ rights”; “put the local workers in the priority” → “prioritize local workers”). A stronger thesis should:
  - Directly answer the prompt: Yes or No (should governments enforce stricter laws?)
  - State your main reasons (brief preview of the two or three points you will develop)
  - Use confident, precise language

Try rewriting the thesis now in one sentence. If you want prompts, try one of these stems:
- “Yes — governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers because … and … .”
- “Governments should enforce stricter protections for migrant workers, since … and … .”
- “To safeguard workers and strengthen national labor markets, governments must … , because … and … .”

Would you like to: (A) try writing a new thesis now, or (B) see one or two example thesis sentences I suggest to help you edit?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:44:47.184Z

**You:** 1. Make my argument stronger (give clearer reasons)

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:45:44.025Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing to focus on making your argument stronger (clearer reasons). Before we begin Step 1, let’s confirm the exact revision targets so we stay focused.

1) Confirmed targets
- Is this correct? You want to revise the thesis AND strengthen the clarity of your main reasons (so the thesis clearly previews them), then revise one body paragraph to match the new thesis. Reply “Yes” if that’s right or specify any change.

2) Which body paragraph would you like to work on in Step 2–3?
- Paragraph 1 (global mindset / cultural benefits)
- Paragraph 2 (labour shortage / replacing young workers)
Tell me which one you prefer.

3) Thesis next — your choice
Would you like to:
A) Try writing a new one-sentence thesis now, or
B) See one or two example thesis sentences I suggest so you can edit them?

Quick reminder of what a strong thesis must do:
- Directly answer the prompt (Yes/No: should governments enforce stricter laws?)
- Preview your main reasons (briefly name the two points)
- Use confident, precise language (no “I think” or hedging)

When you reply, also paste your attempt if you choose A — I’ll give targeted feedback and then ask you to revise again.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:45:53.805Z

**You:** 1. yes 2.paragraph. 3. B. yes. enhance local people's global mindset and replace the lack of labour force.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:51:04.356Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming your targets and choosing paragraph 2 (labour shortage) to work on. I’ll give two clear example thesis sentences you can edit or adapt. Both include your two main reasons: enhancing locals’ global mindset and addressing labour shortages.

Example 1 (direct and simple):
Yes—governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers because doing so preserves cultural exchange that strengthens locals’ global mindset and helps fill critical labour shortages.

Why this works: It answers the question directly, previews the two reasons, and uses confident language.

Example 2 (slightly more formal/academic):
Governments must adopt stronger legal protections for migrant workers to safeguard cultural exchange that enhances local residents’ global perspectives and to address labour shortages that threaten key sectors of the economy.

Why this works: It’s a bit more formal and connects the second reason to economic consequences, which can help you develop the paragraph later.

Which would you like to: (A) adapt one of these now, editing words/word order to match your voice, or (B) try writing your own one-sentence thesis using these as models? Paste your attempt when you’re ready — I’ll give focused feedback and we’ll revise until you’re satisfied.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:51:10.983Z

**You:** Revise topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:57:29.832Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for saying what you want to work on. A quick check before we start so we stay focused:

1) Confirm targets
- Do you want to (A) revise the thesis first then the topic sentence, or (B) skip thesis and only revise a topic sentence + that paragraph? (Pick A or B.)

Reminder: the process normally does thesis first so the topic sentence links clearly to it. If you pick B, I’ll ask you to paste the current thesis so we can still check alignment.

2) Which paragraph do you want to work on?
- Paragraph 1: cultural exchange / global mindset
- Paragraph 2: labour shortages / replacing young workers
(Reply “1” or “2”.)

3) Paste these two things (or tell me which example thesis you prefer)
- Your current thesis (or type “use Example 1” or “use Example 2” from my earlier message).
- The current topic sentence from the paragraph you chose.

Next step options
- Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence yourself first? (Yes — I’ll try) — I’ll give focused feedback and suggestions.
- Or would you like me to show 1–2 short model topic sentences you can edit? (Show models)

A quick reminder of what a strong topic sentence should do:
- Clearly connect to the thesis (same claim, smaller focus).
- Preview the paragraph’s main point.
- Be specific and concise.

Your turn: pick A or B, choose paragraph 1 or 2, and paste the thesis + current topic sentence (or say you want model sentences). I’ll guide you from there.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:57:44.552Z

**You:** 1. B second body paragraph. 2. 2 3. example 1 show models.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:07:54.425Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for the clear choices. Just to confirm before we continue:

- You want to skip revising the thesis for now (option B) but use Example 1 as the working thesis. I’ll paste that here so we both have it:
  Yes — governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers because doing so preserves cultural exchange that strengthens locals’ global mindset and helps fill critical labour shortages.

- You want to work on Paragraph 2 (the labour-shortage paragraph) and asked me to show model topic sentences. Good plan.

Quick feedback on your current topic sentence for paragraph 2:
- Your current sentence: “Second, governments must adopt stronger legal protections for migrant workers to address labour shortages that threaten key sectors of the economy.”
- That already connects to the thesis, but it’s slightly long and abstract. You can make it clearer and tighter by naming the mechanism (legal protections → retention/recruitment) or the consequence (helps fill gaps in specific sectors).

Here are three short model topic sentences you can choose from or edit to match your voice:

- Model 1 (direct, concise):
  Stricter protections for migrant workers are essential because they help fill critical labour shortages in ageing societies.

- Model 2 (focus on mechanism: retention/recruitment):
  By guaranteeing legal rights and safety, governments can encourage migrant workers to remain and thus alleviate severe workforce gaps in key industries.

- Model 3 (more specific / consequences):
  To prevent damaging shortages in sectors such as healthcare and construction, governments should strengthen legal protections that make migrant work safer and more sustainable.

Which would you like to do next?
- Try rewriting your topic sentence now (paste your attempt) — I’ll give focused feedback. (Recommended)
- Or tell me which model you prefer and I’ll help you adapt it to fit your paragraph’s content.

When you’re ready, paste your new topic sentence (or pick a model), and we’ll move to Step 3 to revise the supporting sentences in Paragraph 2.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:08:13.141Z

**You:** model 2

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:11:00.908Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. Quick recap and next step before we revise:

- Working thesis (you asked to keep Example 1):  
  Yes — governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers because doing so preserves cultural exchange that strengthens locals’ global mindset and helps fill critical labour shortages.

- Chosen topic sentence for Paragraph 2 (you picked Model 2):  
  By guaranteeing legal rights and safety, governments can encourage migrant workers to remain and thus alleviate severe workforce gaps in key industries.

Now let’s work on the supporting sentences in that paragraph. First, here is the paragraph as it currently stands (so you can edit from this):

Current Paragraph 2:
Second, governments must adopt stronger legal protections for migrant workers to address labour shortages that threaten key sectors of the economy. By guaranteeing legal rights and safety, governments can encourage migrant workers to remain and thus alleviate severe workforce gaps in key industries. In the recent years, birth rate has been declining vigorously among developed countries. Japan is one of the significant example. As they suffering from lack of young labour force seriously because of the extremely low birth rate in Japan, they urgently require a large amount of it. The migrant workers can hence perfectly tackle this kind of issue. Hence the government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers rights for the sake of rescuing their labour force especially those countries with low birth rate as stricter laws can let the migrant workers feel safe and stay to work in a foreign country.

Guiding questions to help you revise (focus on clarity, unity, and grammar):
- Do each of these sentences clearly explain how legal protections lead to retention/recruitment of migrant workers?
- Are the examples (e.g., Japan) specific and grammatically correct?
- Is there unnecessary repetition (words like “hence,” “hence the government,” and “for the sake of”) that you can cut?
- Do you have clear linking phrases that show cause → effect (e.g., Because…, As a result…, For example…)?

Three focused suggestions (short, actionable — not a full rewrite):
1. Combine and simplify the birth-rate/Japan details into 1–2 clear sentences: use “In recent years” (not “In the recent years”), “birth rates have fallen,” and “Japan, for example,”. Example phrase to adapt: “In recent years, birth rates have fallen sharply in many developed countries; Japan, for example, faces a serious shortage of young workers.”
2. Fix grammar and word choice: change “labour force” → “labour force” is fine (choose British spelling consistently), use possessive: “migrant workers’ rights,” and avoid awkward phrases like “a large amount of it” (say “large numbers of workers”).
3. End the paragraph with a clear linking sentence that ties back to the thesis and topic sentence: show that legal protections increase safety → increase retention → fill labour gaps. Use a concise causal connector: “Therefore, stronger protections make migrant workers more likely to stay, helping to fill labour shortages.”

Would you like to try revising two specific sentences now?
- Option A (recommended): Rewrite the two places I flagged:
  1) The sentence(s) about birth rates and Japan.
  2) The final sentence that ties the example back to the claim (explain how protections lead to staying and filling gaps).
Paste your attempt and I’ll give focused feedback.

- Option B: If you prefer, I can show one short model version of those two sentences for you to edit. (I’ll keep them short — not a full paragraph.)

Which do you prefer?
