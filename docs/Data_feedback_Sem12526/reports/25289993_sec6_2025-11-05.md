## HUMAN-AI COLLABORATION SKILLS ASSESSMENT

Although the student has not completed the required revision tasks, some preliminary evidence about their collaboration process can be evaluated based on the available chat history.

### Interaction Overview

- The student engaged with the AI assistant, providing their draft thesis and responding to AI prompts.
- The AI provided detailed feedback, guidance, and suggestions for strengthening the thesis statement.

### Preliminary Interaction Rubric Scores

#### 1. In-Depth Conversation with AI (5-point scale)
- **Score:** 2/5 (*Basic*)
- **Justification:** The interaction consists of just a few exchanges. The student responded to the prompts with their draft, but there are no follow-up questions, requests for clarification, or deeper inquiry. The conversation is functional but lacks depth or critical questioning.

#### 2. Critical Review of AI Suggestions (5-point scale)
- **Score:** 2/5 (*Basic*)

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

1. **For essay writing skills:** Complete the thesis revision, then proceed stepwise to topic sentences and body paragraphs. Ask specific questions about your wording or logic as you revise.
2. **For AI collaboration skills:** Don’t just accept feedback—discuss it! Ask follow-up questions or explain your reasoning behind revision choices.
3. **For overall improvement:** Treat the revision process as interactive. Make changes, show the AI your new version, and iterate multiple rounds to build critical revision skills.

---

## INSTRUCTOR NOTES

- The student has not yet completed the required revision steps and has not demonstrated active revision or deep collaboration.
- Recommend monitoring the student's progress closely and encouraging more active participation, questioning, and reflection during AI-supported revision sessions.
- Training is still in early stages; further engagement and iterative revision are needed for meaningful assessment.

## Complete Conversation
**Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-05T07:48:53.051Z

**You:** Task 2:
Yes: The government need to enforce stricter laws to safeguard workers rights.
According to the chart, migrants out-performing native-born population has bigger impact on unemployment rate when works face exploitation due to week regulations while suffering long working hours and unfair pay, more workers will quit, which leads to higher unemployment rate. The higher the rate is, the more difficult it is for a country to improve their economy.
So it is needed stricter laws.
By giving more subsidies to workers or higher salary can reduce the unemployment rate and can make good use of the labor in the country. Moreover, government can put up laws to protect workers rights and equity. Such as providing a 3 days rest and implementing different group workers to work at different time.
Concluding the suggestions above, can increase the native born out-performing migrants to a higher number above 8 or increase the migrants out-performing native-born population next to 0 to minimize the rate of unemployment.
Moreover, put up laws to protect workers rights

ensures sustainable working and improves working quality. The law makes workers feel more motived to do the job and they will be glad to do so.
If the law isn't posted, worker might have anger filled in their heart reducing the efficiency and quality, the labor number will decrease at the same time. So it is necessary to enforce stricter law to protect workers rights.

Additionally, for the society, passing stricter laws promotes the community to be more stable and strong. It helps to build a sustainable society.

So the law passing can benefit works, government, society and country economic development.

**Assistant:** Let’s begin our structured three-step revision process for your essay. We’ll focus only on one task at a time and you’ll do the revising yourself, with help and feedback from me! Ready? Let’s start.

**Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**

Please share your current thesis statement for Task 2 (the essay about stricter laws to protect workers’ rights).  
You can copy/paste what you have, or just type what you think your main argument is.  
Once you share your thesis, I’ll give you feedback on its clarity, strength, and focus.

**Your turn:**  
What is your thesis statement for this essay?

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis and related points! Let’s look at it together.

**Feedback on your current thesis:**
- **Clarity:** Your main argument is clear —you support stricter laws to protect workers’ rights.
- **Strength:** Your wording could be stronger and more confident. Right now, “So it is needed stricter laws” and “The government need to enforce stricter laws …” are a bit awkward; try to make it more direct.
- **Focus:** A strong thesis should:
  - Clearly answer the question: *Should governments enforce stricter laws to protect workers’ rights?*
  - Preview your main points: *What are the main benefits or reasons?* (e.g., reducing unemployment, improving working conditions, supporting the economy)
  - Use confident, precise language (avoid “need to” or words like “can make good use…”).

**Guidance for rewriting:**
- Directly answer the essay question (“Yes, governments should …” or “Governments must …”).
- Briefly mention the key reasons: *for example, to reduce unemployment, improve working conditions, and support the country’s economy.*
- Be precise and focused. **Avoid adding examples or explanations** in the thesis—save those for the body paragraphs.

**Prompt:**
Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement now, using my suggestions?  
Aim for one or two strong sentences that state your main argument and the reasons.

*(If you’d like hints or a model structure before you try, just ask!)*
