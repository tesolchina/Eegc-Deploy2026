        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:44:45.733Z

**You:** the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:52:19.796Z

**Assistant:** Great work! Let’s get started with our structured three-step revision process.  

**Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**

Could you please share your current thesis statement?  
(The thesis statement is usually at the end of your introduction and should clearly answer the essay question, preview your key points, and use confident, precise language.)  

Once you share it, I’ll offer feedback on clarity, strength, and focus, and then you’ll get a chance to try revising it yourself.  

Please copy and paste your thesis statement here!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:52:22.009Z

**You:** the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:53:39.390Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement:

> "the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do."

Here’s some feedback:

**Clarity:**  
- The sentence presents the main idea, but it does not clearly show your own position.  
- It also feels more like a general claim rather than your own thesis.

**Strength:**  
- The wording (“do not matter much”) could be more precise and confident.  
- Try to avoid general phrases and clearly state the degree to which you agree or disagree.

**Focus:**  
- The thesis should preview your main points (for example: government influence and personal lifestyle choices).
- It should directly answer the essay question and set out your argument’s structure.

**Suggestions:**
- State your position clearly—do you fully agree, partly agree, or disagree?
- Mention both main points you will discuss (influencing government + personal lifestyle choices).

Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now, using these tips? If you need a prompt, let me know!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:53:43.580Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:57:20.372Z

**Assistant:** That’s a good start, but let’s focus on making it a clear thesis statement that does three things:

1. **Shows your stance** (agree/disagree and to what degree)
2. **Previews your main points** (influence on government, personal lifestyle choices)
3. **Uses confident, precise language**

Right now, the sentence you shared sounds more like a topic sentence.  
Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement so that it directly answers the essay question and previews your essay’s structure?  
Tip: You could begin your thesis with a phrase showing your position (e.g., “While individual actions may be less impactful than those of governments and companies,…”) and then mention your two key ideas.

Whenever you’re ready, give it a try!  
Would you like to type a revision? If you need a guiding prompt sentence, let me know.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:57:25.213Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T07:04:21.041Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing this sentence! I notice that it actually works as a topic sentence for a body paragraph, not as your thesis statement. Remember, your **thesis statement** should appear at the end of your introduction and needs to:

- Clearly state your main argument (whether you agree, disagree, or partly agree with the idea)
- Preview your key supporting points (influencing government & personal lifestyle choices)
- Use confident, precise language

Here’s a recap of your current direction:

> "The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians."

Let’s try revising it together into a true thesis statement.  
Would you like to try combining your main argument (your position on individual action vs. government/business responsibility) with both of your reasons? You can use the sentence starter:

“Although individual actions may not seem as influential as the actions of governments and large companies, they are still important because…”

Go ahead and try a revision! Write your new thesis statement using both of your intended points. I’m here to help if you need ideas.
