### Essay Writing Assessment

#### Original Essay Summary  
The original essay addressed automation/AI’s impact on jobs. It presented relevant examples, like the Hong Kong QR-code ordering system, but was hindered by repetitiveness, vague claims, weak paragraph organization, limited thesis clarity, awkward vocabulary, and frequent grammar errors. Overall coherence and persuasiveness were limited.

#### Revised Essay Summary  
The revised version included a clearer, more confident thesis that outlined three reasons for agreeing automation will reduce jobs: cost, productivity, and automation of routine tasks. The Task 2 paragraph was restructured to introduce the claim, explain mechanisms briefly, and provide the Hong Kong example. Sentence clarity improved substantially, with fewer grammar issues and better word choice, though some phrasing remained imprecise or repetitive. Transitions between paragraphs and deeper development of counterarguments were still limited.

---

### Essay Improvement Analysis

- **Thesis Statement:**  
  Progressed from fragmented and vague wording to a clear, confident single sentence stating the extent of agreement and previewing key reasons.

- **Organization and Paragraph Structure:**  
  Task 2 paragraph topic sentence improved to explicitly state the claim and roadmap the paragraph. Supporting sentences added clearer explanations and example linkage, but paragraph unity and overall essay flow can still be enhanced.

- **Evidence and Examples:**  
  Concrete example (QR code in Hong Kong) was maintained and integrated more clearly with the claim, though numeric data remained unsupported by evidence or citations.

- **Language and Grammar:**  
  Major grammar and sentence structure errors were corrected, improving readability. Some awkward phrasing persisted but at a reduced frequency. Article use, verb agreement, and sentence clarity showed definite improvement.

- **Missed Opportunities:**  
  - Absence of cited data or explanation of figures (e.g., “30 percent”).  
  - Limited counterargument or nuanced discussion of automation’s potential positive effects or new job creation.  
  - Weak transitions between Task 1 and 2, affecting overall essay coherence.

---

### Human-AI Interaction Assessment

- **Engagement and Conversation Quality:**  
  The student participated actively in the structured revision workflow: identifying target (“clarity”), confirming essay topic, responding to templates, and pasting revised text for feedback. The interaction showed clear goal orientation and iterative improvements.

- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions:**  
  The student generally accepted assistant prompts and templates, asking for alternatives when needed but did not frequently critique or reject suggestions explicitly. This reflects developing but not yet mature critical collaboration skills.

- **Refining Process:**  
  A methodical revision took place: thesis formulation → topic sentence development → paragraph content revision. The assistant’s detailed guidance was followed well, though some opportunities for deeper independent editing or multi-cycle rewrites were less present.

---

### Overall Performance Summary

#### Strengths
- Clear identification of revision focus (“clarity”) and adherence to revision steps.
- Good use of a relevant, specific example (Hong Kong QR-code system) to support claims.
- Willingness to iterate and improve language accuracy and sentence structure.
- Development of a clearer thesis with a preview of reasons.

#### Areas for Improvement
- Incorporate sourced data or clarify numerical claims with explanations and references.
- Expand the essay’s argumentative depth by addressing counterarguments and the dual nature of automation’s impact (job losses and creations).
- Enhance paragraph transitions and build a stronger overall essay roadmap to link Task 1 data analysis with Task 2 implications.
- Practice explicit evaluation of AI suggestions by explaining acceptance or rejection to strengthen critical engagement.
- Further reduce repetitive phrasing and improve word variety with topic-specific vocabulary.

---

### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment

- **Context Provision:** Good – The student confirmed the essay topic and revision focus early.
- **Strategic Planning:** Good – The student followed the assistant’s structured step-by-step revision plan.
- **Critical Evaluation:** Developing – The student mostly accepted AI suggestions, with limited explicit critique.
- **Independent Editing:** Good – Produced clearer thesis and paragraph drafts that improved grammar and cohesion.

---

### Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Evidence and Citation:** Always provide clear sources or data explanations when referencing figures or comparative data.
2. **Argument Nuance:** Address possible benefits of automation alongside drawbacks to create a balanced, persuasive argument.
3. **Critical Reflection:** When working with AI, practice stating reasons for accepting or modifying suggestions to deepen independent thought and collaborative learning.
4. **Enhanced Transitions and Cohesion:** Work on linking ideas between paragraphs and across the essay for smoother flow and a unified argument.
5. **Vocabulary Expansion:** Introduce more precise and diverse terminology relevant to automation and labor market discussions.

---

### Instructor Notes

The student has made commendable progress in achieving clarity through focused revision and AI collaboration. The essay’s thesis and Task 2 paragraph show notable improvement in structure and language use. Encouragement should be given to further evidence-based writing and developing critical review skills in AI-assisted revision. Including reflective explanations of AI suggestion choices in future sessions will be a valuable step to strengthening the student’s autonomous academic writing and critical thinking.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The draft identifies a clear topic (automation/AI and jobs) and gives examples (Hong Kong, QR ordering) but ideas are repetitive and underdeveloped. Example: "Then, there seems that more well-developed place would get a higher risk of replacing jobs by AI." is vague and unsupported.
- Organization: 15/25 - Two task paragraphs exist, but topic sentences and transitions are weak and ordering of claims is unclear. The paragraphs often repeat rather than progress (e.g., Task 1 repeats claim about developed vs emerging markets without clear linkage).
- Vocabulary: 16/25 - Some attempt at precise terminology ("Full-Time Equivalent Employment Exposed to Automation") but many word-choice problems and awkward collocations reduce clarity.
- Grammar: 15/25 - Frequent errors in articles, verb agreement, word order, and sentence fragments hinder comprehension (e.g., "Labor always get disadvantaged", "it would be commonly replaced the job by AI").
- **Original Essay Total: 63/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised essay presents a clearer thesis (e.g., "I largely agree that automation will significantly reduce demand for human labour because it is cheaper..., raises productivity, and can perform routine tasks...") and links examples to claims more directly. The argument is more coherent, though still could use more precise evidence and nuance.
- Organization: 21/25 - The revised Task 2 paragraph is better organized: it introduces the claim, explains mechanisms (cost, efficiency, routine-task replacement), and gives the Hong Kong QR-code example. Paragraph-level unity is improved, but transitions between paragraphs and overall roadmap could be stronger.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Word choice improved (fewer awkward phrases, clearer nouns like "productivity" and "routine tasks"). Some repetitive phrasing remains and more topic-specific vocabulary/precise terms would strengthen the piece.
- Grammar: 21/25 - Many grammar and sentence-structure errors from the original were corrected; sentences are longer but clearer. A few remaining problems (minor phrasing and article usage) persist.
- **Revised Essay Total: 83/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +20 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clearer thesis introduced that previews reasons (cost, productivity, routine-task replacement). Evidence: revised thesis sentence included in Task 2.
  - Task 2 paragraph reorganized to state claim, explain mechanisms, and provide a concrete example (QR-code ordering in Hong Kong), improving paragraph unity and clarity.
  - Grammar and sentence-level clarity improved: earlier fragments and major agreement issues became fuller, clearer sentences.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Use and cite clearer data or sources for claims about percentages (e.g., Hong Kong "nearly got 30 percent") — numbers were referenced but not sourced or explained.
  - Add more precise development of counterarguments and nuance (e.g., where automation creates new jobs; specify which workers gain vs lose).
  - Improve transitions and an overall roadmap connecting Task 1 (data) and Task 2 (mechanisms) so the essay reads as a cohesive argument rather than related paragraphs.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 16**
- **Conversation Quality:** Robust, structured, and goal-oriented. The assistant provided a clear three-step revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), diagnostic feedback across categories, templates, and multiple concrete sentence stems the student could adapt. The student responded to prompts, clarified goals, and provided paragraph drafts for revision.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - The chat contains 16 substantive turns, with sustained guidance from the assistant and iterative student responses. The exchange shows multi-level questions and stepwise revision (diagnosis, target selection, thesis/topic-sentence guidance).
  - Evidence: Assistant laid out revision plan, diagnostic feedback, suggested targets, and multiple thesis/topic-sentence templates; student confirmed goals and pasted paragraph drafts.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - The student accepted the assistant’s process and incorporated suggestions (e.g., produced a clearer thesis/topic ideas and revised paragraph). There is some evidence of student agency (choosing "clarity" as focus, asking to work on Task 2), but limited explicit critique or rejection of AI suggestions — most suggestions were accepted rather than deeply evaluated.
  - Evidence: Student followed assistant’s templates and asked for “another” example and then pasted revisions; no long-form justification rejecting major suggestions.
- **Refining Process**: 4/5 - A clear iterative process occurred (diagnosis → thesis guidance → topic-sentence guidance → paragraph revision). Multiple cycles of feedback and revision are visible, though the number of full revision cycles (rewrite + critique) is moderate rather than extensive.
  - Evidence: Assistant repeatedly asked for a one-sentence thesis and topic sentence and provided stems; student produced revised text which was then integrated into the revised essay.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 13/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Focused goal selection and task adherence: The student clearly chose "clarity" as the target and worked through the steps the assistant recommended (evidence: chat turns selecting clarity and pasting revised paragraph).
- Use of concrete example: The Hong Kong QR-code ordering example grounds the claim in a specific, relatable case (present in both original and revised drafts).
- Willingness to iterate: The student accepted feedback, tried revised thesis/topic-sentence forms, and produced a cleaner revised paragraph.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Source and quantify claims: When using numbers ("nearly 30%," "20 percent gap") provide citation or explain data basis and implications more precisely.
- Develop counterarguments and nuance: Acknowledge that automation can create skilled jobs and explain who benefits vs who loses; this will make the essay more balanced and persuasive.
- Stronger independent critical review: When working with AI suggestions, practice explicitly evaluating and selecting among options (for example, explain why you accept one thesis phrasing and reject another).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student clarified which essay (automation/AI) to work on and stated the focus (clarity). Evidence: chat exchange confirming essay topic and target.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student followed a clear stepwise plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) and responded to templates and stems.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good/Developing - The student chose suggestions and adapted them but rarely provided explicit critical justification for accepting/rejecting AI suggestions.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The student produced revised sentences and paragraphs that improved grammar and structure, showing independent application of feedback.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Add sourced evidence and clearer data interpretation: when you cite percentages or cross-country comparisons, include the source or explain how the number supports the argument.
2. Strengthen argumentative nuance: include a brief paragraph acknowledging automation’s job-creating aspects and explain why the losses for routine workers still make you “largely agree.”
3. Practice explicit evaluation of AI feedback: when the AI offers multiple options, write a short note explaining which you chose and why — this improves critical collaboration and shows deeper independent thinking.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student has clearly improved clarity, produced an improved thesis and a more coherent paragraph, and engaged constructively with the AI assistant. However, the work still needs more rigorous evidence use and deeper argumentative nuance to reach an "excellent" level.
- Encourage the student to practice citing data sources and to write short reflective notes in future AI sessions explaining why they accepted or rejected specific AI suggestions (this will boost the "Critical Review" dimension).

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Task 1
First of all, the data dominates that different places’ share of Full-Time Equivalent Employment Exposed to Automation by AI. Then, there seems that more well-developed place would get a higher risk of replacing jobs by AI. For example, Hong Kong which is international finance center, nearly got 30 percent of share of Full-Time Equivalent Employment Exposed to Automation by AI, and Japan, US, UK which are gain very high economies every year. One of reason is that they have better technology development, it would be commonly replaced the job by AI, such as secondary production and other easy jobs. Secondly, there is a huge gap of percent between Hong Kong and India, almost 20 percents. India is emerging market but Hong Kong is developed Market. Also many places which are emerging market get lower percent than the development market. So we could see that Developed Market is influenced by AI more and they also have difference of the technology development. 

Task 2
Firstly, what is Automation, it is a new trend of reducing labor and using machine or AI to enhance the productivity. Why it is useful? Because it can help employees to cut down many cost from labor and it is cheaper than using labor, it can sometimes force the productivity in the long term. So, many employees would consider the balance between cost and efficiency. Labor always get disadvantaged in some industries, such as manufacturing industry. Also, technology has developed well nowadays. But I believe that this technology shift would undermine global employment prospects in the long term. People have to be more unique to maintain their competitiveness. Because AI and machines can do many easy things and replace low-tech jobs. But it can’t do very unique job such as art. If we take Hong Kong as a example. In catering trade, we already haven’t demanded the person who help customers to make orders because we would scan the QR code the restaurant provided to order ourselves. It is useful and efficient for the restaurant and customers. They can also use less labor to reduce costs. So there is no demand for the people who make orders in restaurants, there needs technological people to develop the tech and system to help the movement of the restaurants. In the long term, there would be more technology, it would be harder to find job. So that’s why people have to learn more. But not all of us can successfully follow the trend.


Revised:
Task 1
First of all, the data dominates that different places’ share of Full-Time Equivalent Employment Exposed to Automation by AI. Then, there seems that more well-developed place would get a higher risk of replacing jobs by AI. For example, Hong Kong which is international finance center, nearly got 30 percent of share of Full-Time Equivalent Employment Exposed to Automation by AI, and Japan, US, UK which are gain very high economies every year.

Also many places which are emerging market get lower percent than the development market. So we could see that Developed Market is influenced by AI more and they also have difference of the technology development. 

Task 2
I largely agree that automation will significantly reduce demand for human labour because it is cheaper than labour, increases productivity, and can replace many routine tasks.”  Because automation is cheaper and more productive for routine tasks, firms reduce demand for low-skilled workers, as shown by service examples like QR-code ordering in Hong Kong. Workers are disadvantaged. Lets’ take Hong Kong as an example. In catering trade, we already haven’t demanded the person who helps customers to make orders because we would scan the QR code the restaurant provided to order ourselves. It is useful and efficient for the restaurant and customers. They can also use less labor to reduce costs.  It is a new trend of reducing labor and using machines or AI to enhance productivity. Why is it useful? Because it can help employees to cut down many costs from labor and it is cheaper than using labor, it can sometimes force productivity in the long term. So, many employees would consider the balance between cost and efficiency. Labor always is disadvantaged in some industries, especially manufacturing industry. Although technology has advanced rapidly in recent years, I believe this shift will negatively impact global employment in the long term. As AI and machines become capable of handling many routine and low-tech jobs, people must develop unique skills to remain competitive. While technology can replace repetitive tasks, it cannot replicate truly creative work, such as art. By cutting labor costs and improving productivity in sectors such as hospitality and manufacturing, automation reduces demand for workers in routine positions. With the proliferation of technology, the job market is expected to become increasingly competitive in the long term. Consequently, continuous learning is essential, yet not everyone will be capable of adapting to this rapid shift.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-29T17:58:40.318Z

**You:** first

*Time:* 2025-11-29T18:02:29.391Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s get started. Before I revise anything, I want to know what you want to get better at today and share a quick diagnosis so you can pick the priorities.

1) Your goals
What are your top 1–2 goals for this session? (Choose from: clarity, argument strength/position, organization/structure, evidence/use of examples, grammar/mechanics, or style/word choice.) Or tell me a different goal.

2) Brief diagnostic feedback (quick and clear)
I reviewed your draft and here’s a short diagnosis using four rubric categories.

- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: You identify a clear topic (automation/AI and jobs) and you express an opinion that automation will undermine employment in the long term.
  - Needs work: There’s no single clear, concise thesis sentence that answers a central question and previews the main points. The argument is sometimes vague and repetitive instead of showing a clear line of reasoning.

- Organization
  - Strengths: You use two task paragraphs that focus on related ideas (data/example; definition/implications).
  - Needs work: Paragraphs are not fully developed or logically ordered. Transitions between ideas are weak. Topic sentences don’t clearly preview each paragraph’s main point in relation to an overall thesis.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: You use concrete examples (Hong Kong, QR-code ordering) which is good.
  - Needs work: Numbers and comparisons are unclear or un-sourced; explanations sometimes jump from example to claim without clear linking. Need clearer explanation of how examples support your main claim.

- Language Use (grammar, word choice, clarity)
  - Strengths: Vocabulary attempts to be precise (e.g., “Full-Time Equivalent Employment Exposed to Automation”).
  - Needs work: Frequent grammar mistakes, awkward phrasing, article and preposition errors, and sentence fragments make parts hard to follow. Word order and singular/plural agreement need attention. Some sentences are long and confusing.

3) Suggested targets (pick 1–3)
Based on the diagnosis, here are sensible targets you could work on. Which would you like to focus on today? Pick up to three.
- Create a clear, strong thesis that answers the question and previews points.
- Strengthen one body paragraph’s topic sentence so it links tightly to the new thesis.
- Revise that paragraph’s supporting sentences for clarity and evidence (expand or clarify examples).
- Fix key grammar problems that most affect clarity (articles, verb forms, sentence structure).

My recommendation: Focus first on a stronger thesis and then revise one paragraph (topic sentence + paragraph content). That gives a lot of improvement without rewriting the whole essay.

4) Your choice
Which target(s) do you want to focus on? Confirm your choice and then we’ll move to Step 1 (thesis revision).

*Time:* 2025-11-29T18:02:40.035Z

**You:** 1：clarity

*Time:* 2025-11-29T18:03:54.062Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing clarity as your focus. A couple quick checks before we begin Step 1:

1) One important mismatch I noticed: the prompt you gave at the top is about climate change (individual actions vs governments/corporations), but your draft is about automation and AI replacing jobs. Which essay do you want to work on today — the climate-change prompt or the automation/AI draft? (We should work on one; tell me which.)

2) Confirmed target: clarity (and we’ll focus on a clearer thesis first, then revise one body paragraph). Is that still correct?

When you confirm those two things, please paste your current thesis statement (one sentence). If you don’t yet have a single clear thesis sentence, try to write one that answers the assigned question in one confident sentence — then paste it here. I’ll give brief feedback and ask you to rewrite it until you’re satisfied.

Hints to keep in mind as you try:
- Directly answer the essay question (state to what extent you agree/disagree).
- Preview 2–3 main reasons you will develop in the essay (this becomes your roadmap).
- Use confident language (avoid “I think,” “maybe,” “possibly”).
Would you like to try writing that thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T18:04:03.450Z

**You:** 1:automation and AI replacing jobs. 2:clarity. I believe automation will replace labor in the reality. automation is Useful, cheaper, efficiency, and it chanllenge labor so much. YES

*Time:* 2025-11-29T18:09:27.397Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming: we’ll work on the automation/AI draft, and your main focus is clarity. Nice start with the ideas you want to include.

Quick feedback on your current thesis ("I believe automation will replace labor in the reality. automation is Useful, cheaper, efficiency, and it chanllenge labor so much. YES"):
- Strengths: It states your main claim (automation will replace labor) and mentions reasons (useful, cheaper, more efficient).
- What to improve: grammar and word choice (e.g., “in the reality,” “chanllenge”), sentence structure, and—most important—you need one clear, confident sentence that (a) answers the question (to what extent do you agree?), and (b) previews 2–3 reasons you will develop.

Hints to use when you rewrite:
- Avoid “I believe” and “YES.” Use confident language: “I strongly/mostly agree” or “I disagree.”
- Be specific about the extent: “largely/mostly,” “to a significant extent,” or “only partially.”
- Preview 2–3 clear reasons in the same sentence (for example: cost, efficiency/productivity, replacement of routine tasks; optionally mention the need for retraining or creation of new skilled jobs).

A simple template you can use (fill the blanks):
- “I [agree/mostly agree/strongly agree] that automation will [significantly/partially] reduce demand for human labour because it [is cheaper than human labour], [raises productivity/efficiency], and [can perform routine tasks that many workers currently do].”

Would you like to try rewriting a single-sentence thesis now using that template? Paste your new sentence here and I’ll give quick feedback and help you tighten it.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T18:09:40.183Z

**You:** how about the body paragraph of task 2

*Time:* 2025-11-29T18:16:29.327Z

**Assistant:** Nice — thanks. Quick check so we stay on the agreed workflow:

- Confirmed essay: automation/AI draft (not climate change). Is that still correct?  
- Confirmed target: clarity, and we’ll follow the order: Step 1 thesis first, then Step 2 topic sentence and Step 3 paragraph. Do you want to keep that order, or do you prefer to jump straight to Task 2 paragraph now? (If you want to jump, I’ll still need your current thesis or its short summary so the topic sentence can link to it.)

If you want to work on Task 2 now, paste the full paragraph for Task 2 (or at least its topic sentence). Below is a quick, focused diagnosis of your Task 2 paragraph and clear next steps.

Brief diagnosis of Task 2 paragraph
- Strengths: You define automation, state a clear position (automation will undermine jobs), and give a concrete example (QR-code ordering in Hong Kong). Those are useful building blocks.
- Needs work: The paragraph repeats ideas without a clear topic sentence that ties directly to a thesis. Sentences are often grammatically awkward, which reduces clarity. The example (QR ordering) is given, but the link between that example and your main claim (why automation reduces jobs in the long term) needs clearer explanation and signposting. Also, end claim about everyone needing to “learn more” needs more specific implication (what kinds of jobs? who benefits/loses?).

How we’ll proceed (pick one)
A) Do Step 1 now: paste your best single-sentence thesis and I’ll help you tighten it. Then we’ll revise Task 2 topic sentence to link to it. — Recommended.  
B) Skip to Task 2: paste the paragraph (or topic sentence) and your current thesis summary; I’ll help you strengthen the topic sentence and then the supporting sentences.

If you choose B, here are practical, non-full-sentence guidance items to help you try revising the topic sentence yourself (I won’t write the whole sentence for you — try one, then I’ll give feedback):

- What a strong topic sentence should do here:
  - State the paragraph’s main claim in one clear clause (for example: which type of jobs are affected or which mechanism causes job loss).
  - Link that claim explicitly to your thesis (e.g., “this is one reason automation will undermine employment long-term”).
  - Preview the paragraph’s evidence (mention Hong Kong/QR ordering or “service-sector routine tasks”).

- Topic-sentence stem ideas (fill in with specifics, don’t copy them as final sentences):
  - “[Mechanism: cost/efficiency/routine automation] causes a decline in demand for [specific jobs], which supports my view that automation will undermine employment long-term.”  
  - “The growing use of automation in everyday services — for example, QR-code ordering in Hong Kong restaurants — shows how [routine service tasks] can be replaced, reducing demand for low-skilled workers.”  
  - “Because automation is cheaper and more efficient for routine tasks, firms replace human labor in [sector], illustrating a long-term threat to employment.”

Try one short revision of the topic sentence now (one sentence). Paste it here and I’ll give quick feedback on clarity and linkage to the thesis. After we agree on the topic sentence, we’ll revise the supporting sentences in that paragraph (I’ll ask focused questions and offer short hints to help you tighten explanations, add clear links between example and claim, and fix the highest-impact grammar issues).

*Time:* 2025-11-29T18:16:45.230Z

**You:** correct. clarity. topic sentence is :Firstly, I mostly agree that automation will significantly reduce demand for human labour because it is cheaper than human labour, raises productivity, and can perform routine tasks that many workers currently do.  body paragraph is:So, what is Automation? It is a new trend of reducing labor and using machine or AI to enhance the productivity. Why it is useful? Because it can help employees to cut down many cost from labor and it is cheaper than using labor, it can sometimes force the productivity in the long term. So, many employees would consider the balance between cost and efficiency. Labor always get disadvantaged in some industries, such as manufacturing industry. Also, technology has developed well nowadays. But I believe that this technology shift would undermine global employment prospects in the long term. People have to be more unique to maintain their competitiveness. Because AI and machines can do many easy things and replace low-tech jobs. But it can’t do very unique job such as art. If we take Hong Kong as a example. In catering trade, we already haven’t demanded the person who help customers to make orders because we would scan the QR code the restaurant provided to order ourselves. It is useful and efficient for the restaurant and customers. They can also use less labor to reduce costs. So there is no demand for the people who make orders in restaurants, there needs technological people to develop the tech and system to help the movement of the restaurants.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T18:18:41.475Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — you’ve got a clear position and useful examples to build on. Quick confirmations: we’re working on the automation/AI essay and your main target is clarity. Good.

Step 1 — Thesis feedback and rewrite
Your current thesis:  
“Firstly, I mostly agree that automation will significantly reduce demand for human labour because it is cheaper than human labour, raises productivity, and can perform routine tasks that many workers currently do.”

Quick feedback (very focused)
- Strengths: It answers the question and previews three reasons — good roadmap.
- Small fixes to improve clarity/confidence:
  - Remove “Firstly” (thesis should be a single clear sentence, no list marker).
  - Prefer stronger phrasing than “I mostly agree” — “I mostly agree” is okay, but “I largely agree” or “I argue that automation will” sounds more confident.
  - Tighten repetition (“cheaper than human labour” → “cheaper than human labour” is fine; avoid repeating “human labour” twice).
  - Keep it one sentence that directly previews 2–3 reasons.

Try now: please rewrite the thesis into one clear, confident sentence (no “Firstly”). Use one of these templates if helpful:
- “I largely agree that automation will significantly reduce demand for human labour because it is cheaper than labour, increases productivity, and can replace many routine tasks.”
- Or: “Automation will largely undermine global employment prospects because it cuts labour costs, raises productivity, and automates routine service and manufacturing jobs.”

Write your one-sentence thesis now and paste it here. I’ll give quick feedback and help you tighten it.

Step 2 — Topic-sentence guidance (for your Task 2 paragraph)
You asked to work on Task 2. Your paragraph currently starts with definitions and questions (e.g., “So, what is Automation?”). We want a clear topic sentence that:
- States the paragraph’s main claim in one line,
- Links it to your thesis (e.g., “this is one reason automation will reduce jobs”), and
- Previews the evidence you’ll use (e.g., cost, productivity, QR-code example).

Try one of these stems (fill in specifics; don’t copy verbatim unless you adapt it):
- “[Mechanism]: Because automation is cheaper and more productive for routine tasks, firms reduce demand for low-skilled workers, as shown by service examples like QR-code ordering in Hong Kong.”
- “The growing use of automation in everyday services — for example, QR-code ordering in restaurants — shows how routine service jobs can be replaced, supporting my view that automation will weaken employment prospects.”
- “By cutting labor costs and raising efficiency in routine sectors, automation directly reduces demand for many common jobs, which helps explain long-term employment declines.”

Now please write a single revised topic sentence for your paragraph (one sentence). Paste it here.

Before you revise the rest of the paragraph, a few high-impact grammar/editing tips to apply:
- Avoid question-first openings (“So, what is Automation?”) — state the claim instead.
- Keep verbs simple and correct: “Labor always get disadvantaged” → “Workers are disadvantaged.”
- Fix articles and prepositions: “take Hong Kong as a example” → “take Hong Kong as an example.”
- Combine and simplify long/awkward sentences. Aim for clear subject → verb → object order.
- Replace vague phrases: “it would be harder to find job” → “it will be harder to find jobs” (and be specific: which jobs?).

Next steps
1) Paste your revised one-sentence thesis.  
2) Paste your revised one-sentence topic sentence for Task 2.  
After you do both, paste the full revised Task 2 paragraph (with your edits). I’ll help you refine the topic sentence if needed and then guide you through revising the supporting sentences for clarity, unity, and stronger links to the thesis.

**You:** another

**Assistant:** Do you mean “another” thesis example, another topic-sentence idea, or something else? Quick options — pick one:

1) I’d like another thesis example.
2) I’d like another topic-sentence example for Task 2.
3) I want you to rewrite my thesis (I’ll paste it).

If you want examples, here are three short thesis templates you can adapt (choose one and tweak it to match your voice):

- A (strong): “Automation will significantly weaken global employment prospects because it reduces labor costs, increases productivity, and replaces many routine service and manufacturing jobs.”  
- B (moderate): “I largely agree that automation will reduce demand for many jobs over time because it is cheaper than human labor, raises efficiency, and can perform routine tasks once done by workers.”  
- C (nuanced): “While automation creates new skilled roles, it will overall undermine employment prospects for many workers by cutting labor costs, automating routine tasks, and concentrating gains in high-tech sectors.”

And three short topic-sentence stems for your Task 2 paragraph (fill in specifics):

- 1: “Because automation is cheaper and more efficient for routine tasks, firms are replacing low-skilled service jobs—an effect visible in examples like QR-code ordering in Hong Kong.”  
- 2: “The growing use of automation in everyday services shows how routine roles can disappear, which supports the view that automation threatens long-term employment.”  
- 3: “By cutting labor costs and improving productivity in sectors such as hospitality and manufacturing, automation reduces demand for workers in routine positions.”

Which option do you want? If you choose an example, try adapting one into your own sentence and paste it here. I’ll give quick feedback and we’ll move to the topic sentence and paragraph edits.

**You:** Also, technology has developed well nowadays. But I believe that this technology shift would undermine global employment prospects in the long term. People have to be more unique to maintain their competitiveness. Because AI and machines can do many easy things and replace low-tech jobs. But it can’t do very unique job such as art.

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a great place to work from. A few quick questions so we can set clear goals before we start revising.

1) What are your top 1–2 goals for today? (Choose from: clarity, argument strength/position, organization/structure, evidence/use of examples, grammar/mechanics, style/word choice.) Or tell me a different goal.

2) Quick diagnostic summary (very brief) based on your draft:
- Thesis & Argument: You state a clear position (automation will harm jobs) but your thesis needs to be one clear sentence that previews the reasons you will develop. Right now the claim is repeated in different places instead of framed as a single roadmap.
- Organization: Good that you separate Task 1 (data) and Task 2 (definition + implications), but topic sentences and transitions are weak. Paragraphs need clearer main ideas linked to the thesis.
- Evidence & Development: You use useful concrete examples (Hong Kong, QR ordering), which is a strength. But the link from example → claim needs clearer explanation and sometimes the numbers/claims are vague.
- Language Use: Frequent grammar, article, and verb-form errors make some sentences hard to follow. Fixing a few high-impact grammar items will improve clarity a lot.

3) Suggested revision targets (pick up to three)
- Create one clear, confident thesis that answers the question and previews 2–3 reasons.
- Strengthen one body paragraph’s topic sentence so it links tightly to the new thesis (I recommend Task 2).
- Revise that paragraph’s supporting sentences for clarity and stronger links to your evidence (expand/explain the QR-code example).
- (Optional) Fix the top 5 grammar errors that block understanding (articles, verb agreement, sentence structure).

My recommendation: focus on a clearer thesis first, then revise Task 2 (topic sentence + paragraph content). That gives the most improvement in one session.

4) Which targets do you want to focus on today? Confirm your choice and confirm we are working on the automation/AI essay (not the climate prompt).

Step 1 — Thesis
Please paste your current one-sentence thesis here. If you don’t have a single sentence yet, try writing one now. Use this short template if it helps:
- “Automation will largely undermine global employment prospects because it reduces labor costs, increases productivity, and replaces many routine service and manufacturing jobs.”

If you want, paste the thesis you wrote earlier (“Firstly, I mostly agree that automation will significantly reduce demand for human labour because it is cheaper than human labour, raises productivity, and can replace many routine tasks…”) — I’ll give quick feedback, then ask you to rewrite it. Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now?
