# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 14/25 - The original shows a basic position (automation reduces some jobs and reskilling is needed) but ideas are underdeveloped and often unclear. Example: "this technological may shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term" is vague and hedged.
- Organization: 13/25 - There is a basic introduction-body-conclusion attempt, but paragraphing and logical sequencing are weak and sentences run together, reducing clarity.
- Vocabulary: 12/25 - Limited and sometimes incorrect word choices (e.g., “automaton,” “nave,” “con't”) reduce precision.
- Grammar: 10/25 - Frequent errors (spelling, punctuation, fragments, run-ons) significantly impede comprehension.
- **Original Essay Total: 49/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised version presents a clear, defensible thesis: "This technological shift ultimately has mixed effects on long-term global employment prospects..." It explicitly previews three reasons (displacement, productivity-driven job creation, demand for reskilling). This is a substantial content improvement.
- Organization: 20/25 - Structure is clearer (thesis paragraph, a paragraph on reskilling, conclusion). Paragraph 2 focuses on the proposed solution. Some sentences still combine multiple ideas and would benefit from further splitting to improve flow.
- Vocabulary: 19/25 - Improved vocabulary (reskilling, productivity-driven, AI-complementary) and more precise phrasing. Some repetition ("AI automation") and informal contractions ("can’t") remain; opportunities to use more academic synonyms (e.g., "cannot," "complementarity," "upskill") persist.
- Grammar: 18/25 - Grammar and sentence structure have improved markedly; however, punctuation/spacing errors, several run-on sentences, and occasional awkward phrasing remain. Examples: missing spaces after commas, run-ons in paragraph 2 ("Also,we can learn... while we possess..."), and the conclusion's "we can’t only protect" (should be "not only").
- **Revised Essay Total: 78/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +29 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clear, assertive thesis that previews three main points: the revised thesis states mixed effects and lists displacement, new job creation, and demand for reskilled workers.
  - Stronger organization: the revised draft separates the thesis, a solution-oriented body paragraph, and a conclusion, making argument structure easier to follow.
  - Better vocabulary and clarity: use of terms like "productivity-driven new job creation" and "AI-complementary roles" increases academic tone and precision.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Grammar and punctuation need further polishing: fix spacing after commas, hyphenate "short-term," replace contractions with formal forms, and correct "we can’t only" → "not only ... but also."
  - Sentence boundaries and cohesion: several run-on sentences should be split and transitions tightened for smoother logical progression.
  - Deeper supporting evidence: the essay would benefit from one concrete example or brief data point to strengthen the claim (e.g., an example of a job transformed by automation).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 19**
- **Conversation Quality:** The chat shows an extended, structured, goal-oriented interaction. The assistant provided a clear three-step revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), diagnostic feedback, templates, and micro-edit suggestions. The student repeatedly confirmed choices, supplied revised text, and implemented suggestions iteratively.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - The interaction is extensive (19 messages) and iterative. The assistant guided stepwise revisions and the student followed through multiple cycles (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph), which demonstrates substantial depth.
  - Evidence: the assistant’s scaffolding messages (e.g., describing targets and a three-step revision process) and the student’s repeated confirmations and paste-ins of revised text across multiple turns.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - The student made deliberate choices (selected Targets A and B, chose paragraph 2 to edit) and implemented many AI suggestions. However, there is limited record of the student challenging or independently rejecting AI recommendations; most suggestions were accepted and acted on.
  - Evidence: the student followed the assistant’s templates and steps and reported "I have completed all the revisions" rather than offering critical counter-proposals or alternate approaches.
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - The chat documents multiple meaningful revision cycles: initial draft → assistant diagnosis → thesis guidance → topic-sentence revision → paragraph revision → final full-text submission. The student iteratively revised and asked for further polishing.
  - Evidence: stepwise confirmations and repeated submissions of revised text (e.g., student pasted the paragraph for line-by-line feedback, then posted the full revised article).

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear acceptance and application of guided revision steps: the student implemented the suggested three-step process and produced a stronger thesis and paragraph (evidence: revised thesis and paragraph included in final text).
- Improved argumentative clarity: the revised thesis succinctly states the position and previews supporting points.
- Productive iterative collaboration: frequent, focused exchanges with the assistant and repeated revisions show effective use of AI guidance.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Proofreading for grammar and punctuation: fix spacing after punctuation, hyphenation ("short-term"), formalize contractions, and correct “we can’t only” → "not only... but also."
- Sentence-level clarity and cohesion: break long run-on sentences into clearer, single-idea sentences and use transition phrases to connect ideas smoothly.
- Add a concrete example or brief evidence to strengthen the paragraph that defends reskilling (e.g., an industry example or a short illustrative scenario).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student stated revision goals ("make the argument/thesis clearer and stronger ,and fix grammar, spelling and sentence clarity") and selected targets; chat shows the assistant tailored guidance accordingly.
- **Strategic Planning**: Excellent - The student followed a clear strategy (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) and confirmed which paragraph to work on.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good - The student made choices about which suggestions to accept and which targets to prioritize; however, more explicit critique of suggestions would show stronger critical evaluation.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The student performed independent revisions and submitted updated drafts, but a final pass of self-editing for punctuation and sentence splitting is still needed.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Perform a careful proofreading pass focused solely on punctuation and sentence boundaries (fix spacing after commas, hyphenate compound adjectives, replace contractions with formal forms).
2. Break longer sentences into two when they contain more than one main idea; use linking words (therefore, moreover, as a result) to make logical connections clearer.
3. Add one short, concrete example or illustration (even a hypothetical scenario) to the body paragraph to better demonstrate how emotional intelligence or critical thinking secures jobs in practice.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student has successfully followed the assistant's structured revision workflow and produced measurable improvements in thesis clarity and paragraph focus. However, the final submission still contains mechanical errors (punctuation/spacing/run-ons) that suggest the student would benefit from an independent proofreading strategy or a short checklist for final edits. The chat shows strong engagement; the student might be encouraged to practice briefly challenging or testing AI suggestions (e.g., proposing alternative phrasings) to build critical evaluation skills.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
I think so, with the development of the automation , more and more jobs may be don't need such a lot people to work, because less workers means more revenue and higher efficiency, this technological may shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term, under the environment, if someone can't bring some value to the company. he must lose his job, the automation can do better.
To avoid the situation, I think we should improve our ability and try to learn some skills that AI automaton  can't afford now, we should let our boss to find our value so we can save our jobs. Also,we can learn to use the AI automation better, we nave something son that the AI can't get, such as feeling thinking, we can use AI automation to get information and learn skills, so the can finish some works that we can't do it before .
Finally. I think, the reducing of jobs we con't avoid it, but we can learn how to use AI automation correctly and n use it to help us to improve ourselves, we just need some courage to try it. We can get more revenue and save our jobs.

Revised:
Automation ultimately has mixed effects on long-term global employment prospects， it undermines short-term job security by replacing routine roles, boosts productivity to spawn new job opportunities, and fuels demand for reskilled workers in AI-complementary positions.

To mitigate short-term job displacement risk, workers should pursue skilling to master skills that automation can‘t  replicate, such as emotional intelligence and critical thinking. This is important because these traits let workers demonstrate unique value to employers, and automation can’t replicate this uniqueness. For example, an employee’s ability to resolve complex interpersonal conflicts relies on emotional intelligence; as a result, this skill helps secure their position.

Additionally, workers can learn to leverage automation more effectively. Since they possess these irreplaceable traits, they can use AI to gather information and build skills-empowering them to complete tasks they previously could not handle.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-22T12:35:53.049Z

**You:** Revise thesis statemet

*Time:* 2025-11-22T13:20:12.015Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s start by setting clear targets so our work is focused and useful. Before I revise anything, a few quick questions and a brief diagnosis of your essay.

1) Your goals
- What do you want most from this session? (Choose one or two)
  - Make the argument/thesis clearer and stronger
  - Improve paragraph structure and logical flow
  - Fix grammar, spelling and sentence clarity
  - Improve academic style and vocabulary
  - Other (tell me)

2) Suggested learning targets (pick up to two)
- Target A: Create a clear, confident thesis that directly answers the question and previews 2–3 main points.
- Target B: Improve language accuracy (grammar, punctuation, word choice) so sentences are clear and professional.
- Target C: Strengthen paragraph topic sentences so each paragraph clearly links to the thesis.

Which of these would you like to focus on? (Reply with your choice(s) and any extra note.)

Diagnostic feedback (quick, rubric-focused)
- Content & Ideas: Developing (3). You have a clear basic viewpoint — automation will reduce some jobs — and you offer a reasonable solution (upskilling). But the argument is general and needs a clearer claim and clearer reasons/support.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Basic to Developing (2–3). The essay has an introduction, body idea, and conclusion, but sentences are disjointed and paragraphing is unclear. The essay needs a stronger thesis that the paragraphs can connect to.
- Vocabulary: Basic (2). Many words are used repeatedly and some are incorrect (e.g., “automaton,” “withe,” “nave”). You can improve by choosing precise academic terms (automation, displacement, reskilling, productivity).
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Limited to Basic (1–2). Frequent errors (spelling, punctuation, sentence fragments, run-on sentences) make meaning hard to follow.

Strengths to build on
- You have a clear position and an idea for a solution (learning new skills and using AI).
- You attempt to conclude and restate your main idea.
- The essay addresses the prompt directly (impact of automation on jobs).

Next step (student choice)
- Do you want to focus on revising the thesis only, or the thesis plus language corrections, or thesis plus paragraph/topic sentence work? Tell me which targets you confirm.

Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 1. I’ll ask you to share the thesis you want to revise (you already have one in the draft — that’s fine), then I’ll give feedback and ask you to try a revision. Would you like to begin now with Target A (thesis) only, or add Target B or C as well?

*Time:* 2025-11-22T13:20:27.251Z

**You:** To the question 1 ,I want to make the argument/thesis clearer and stronger ,and fix grammar, spelling and sentence clarity

*Time:* 2025-11-22T13:27:58.801Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for that clear answer. We’ll focus on:
- Target A: make the thesis clearer and stronger
- Target B: fix grammar, spelling and sentence clarity

Quick reminder of the diagnosis tied to these targets
- You already have a clear position (automation will reduce some jobs) and a solution idea (upskilling). Good!
- Right now the thesis is unclear, hedged (e.g., “I think so”), and doesn’t preview the main reasons you’ll discuss. Grammar and word choice also make the meaning hard to follow.
- Our aim: create a short, confident thesis that answers the question directly and previews 2–3 main points (for example: job displacement, productivity/new job creation, and the role of reskilling/policy).

Step 1 — Thesis revision
Please paste the thesis sentence you want to revise (you can use the one from your draft, or a new attempt). Before you try, here are two quick pieces of guidance:

- Avoid phrases like “I think” or “maybe.” State your position confidently.
- Use a simple frame: Automation ultimately [enhances | undermines | has mixed effects on] long-term global employment prospects because it [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].
  - Example frame (fill in your ideas): Automation ultimately undermines/enhances/has mixed effects on global employment in the long term because it [displaces routine jobs], [increases productivity and creates new roles], and [makes reskilling essential to protect workers].

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now (1–2 sentences)? Paste your version and I’ll give quick, focused feedback and one suggestion to strengthen it.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T13:28:12.964Z

**You:** I think you should help me to revise thesis statement first

*Time:* 2025-11-22T13:35:23.278Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. We’ll focus on the thesis first (Targets A and B). I’ll guide you, and I want you to try a revision before I give a model.

Quick feedback on your current thesis (from your draft):
- It uses hedging (“I think so”) and is not concise.
- It’s a long, run-on sentence with unclear organization.
- It doesn’t clearly preview the main reasons you will discuss.
- Some word choice and grammar interfere with meaning.

Guidance to help you rewrite (use one or two sentences):
- Drop “I think” — state your position confidently.
- Use a simple frame: Automation ultimately [enhances | undermines | has mixed effects] long-term global employment because it [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].
- Choose 2–3 clear reasons you will develop in the essay (for example: displacement of routine jobs; productivity and new job creation; the importance of reskilling and policy).

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Paste 1–2 sentences here and I’ll give quick, focused feedback and one suggestion to strengthen it. If you prefer, I can also show a model after your attempt.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T13:35:35.744Z

**You:** I have completed my revisions , now please revise topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-22T13:58:36.652Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for telling me. Before I revise anything, one quick confirmation:

Which single body paragraph do you want to work on now? (We’ll focus on only one paragraph’s topic sentence and then revise that paragraph’s content.) I suggest the second paragraph (your paragraph that begins, “To avoid this outcome…”). Is that okay?

If yes, paste the current topic sentence you want to improve (or say “use paragraph 2” and I’ll use the sentence from your revised draft). I’ll then:

- Give brief feedback on how well it links to your thesis.
- Point out specific ways to strengthen it (content, clarity, vocabulary).
- Give a short template (with blanks) to guide a student rewrite (I won’t write a full replacement sentence).
- Ask you to try a revised topic sentence, and then we’ll move to revising the rest of that paragraph.

Quick feedback on the current sentence if you want to proceed with paragraph 2 now:
Current topic sentence from your draft: “To avoid this outcome, we should enhance our professional capabilities and learn skills that AI automation can’t replicate.”

How it connects to your thesis
- Good: It addresses your thesis’s solution (reskilling) and therefore is relevant.
- Needs work: It repeats “AI automation,” is somewhat general, and doesn’t state clearly how reskilling links to the thesis’s claims (e.g., preventing displacement, creating higher-value roles, or increasing productivity).

Three focused improvements to make
1. Make the main claim precise — name the action (upskill/reskill) and the intended effect (reduce displacement / secure employment).
2. Link that effect to the thesis reasons — e.g., show that human skills (emotional intelligence, critical thinking) complement automation and create new roles.
3. Use stronger academic verbs and avoid repetition — replace “learn skills” with “develop” or “acquire,” and use “automation” once.

A short template you can use (fill the blanks — this is not a full sentence I’m writing for you):
- “[Action] + to [specific effect], because humans provide [unique traits/skills] that automation cannot replace.”

Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence now using that template? Paste your version and I’ll give quick, targeted feedback and help correct grammar/word choice.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T13:59:40.256Z

**You:** Yes , please use the second paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-22T14:02:26.170Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. We’ll work on paragraph 2, but first we need to finish Step 1 (the thesis). Please paste the single thesis sentence (or 1–2 sentences) you want to revise. You can:

- Paste the thesis from your Current Revised Version, or
- Try a new version now using the frame below.

Quick reminders to help you write it:
- Drop hedging (no “I think”).
- State a clear position: automation ultimately undermines / enhances / has mixed effects.
- Preview 2–3 reasons you will develop (e.g., displacement of routine jobs; productivity and new job creation; need for reskilling and policy).
- Short frame you can copy: Automation ultimately [enhances | undermines | has mixed effects on] long-term global employment because it [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].

Would you like to paste your thesis now, or try a new one using the frame? If you want, I can also start with a quick suggestion after your attempt.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T14:02:36.690Z

**You:** I have completed the revision of my topic sentence , now please help me to revise one body paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-22T14:34:04.816Z

**Assistant:** Great — well done finishing the topic sentence. Before I revise anything, let’s be clear about the next steps so our work stays focused and useful.

Quick confirmation
- Targets we’re working on: Target A (clear, strong thesis — already done) and Target B (language accuracy). Good.
- Paragraph to revise: paragraph 2 (the one about upskilling/reskilling). Confirmed.

Please paste the full paragraph you want to revise, including your revised topic sentence. I’ll not rewrite it for you straight away — I’ll first give focused guidance and short templates so you can try improvements. After you attempt revisions, I’ll give targeted corrections (grammar, vocabulary, coherence) and, if you ask, provide the full updated essay text.

To guide your revision, use this short checklist and these guiding questions as you paste or edit:

Unity and relevance
- Does every sentence clearly support the topic sentence’s main claim (e.g., “We should reskill to reduce displacement and secure employment”)?
- Remove or rewrite any sentence that drifts to a different idea.

Support and development
- Do you have at least one specific reason or example that explains why those human skills matter (e.g., emotional intelligence enables customer relations that automation can’t replace; critical thinking is needed to design and monitor AI)?
- If possible, add a concrete example or brief explanation — not necessarily a statistic, but a short illustration (e.g., “customer service roles often require empathy” or “data shows new tech roles require digital literacy”).

Explanation and linking
- After a fact or claim, add a sentence that explains how it connects back to securing work or creating new roles.
- Use clear linking phrases: therefore, as a result, consequently, in other words, for example.

Clarity, precision, and tone
- Replace weak verbs and phrases (“learn skills,” “can’t afford now”) with precise academic wording: develop/acquire skills, automation cannot replicate, upskill/reskill, complementarities between humans and machines.
- Avoid repetition of “AI automation” — use “automation” or “AI” once per sentence.
- Keep sentences concise and avoid run-ons. If two ideas are joined with “and,” consider splitting into two sentences.

Short templates you can use to revise supporting sentences (fill the blanks)
- Explanation: “This matters because ________, which automation cannot replicate.”
  Example: “This matters because empathy enables staff to handle complex customer problems, which automation cannot replicate.”
- Evidence + link: “For example, ________. As a result, ________.”
  Example: “For example, employers increasingly value employees who can interpret AI outputs and make judgment calls. As a result, workers who develop these skills are more likely to keep or move into higher-value roles.”
- Transition to next idea: “Moreover, ________, further supporting the need to ________.”

A quick editing focus for language accuracy
- Check subject-verb agreement, articles (a/an/the), and verb forms (e.g., “we should develop” not “we should to develop”).
- Break long sentences into two when they contain more than one main idea.
- Use academic vocabulary: displacement, productivity, reskilling/upskilling, complementarity, secure employment, productivity gains.

Would you like to:
A) Paste your paragraph now so I can give specific line-by-line suggestions? — I’ll prompt you to revise individual sentences, then check grammar.
B) Try revising the paragraph now using the checklist and templates, then paste your new version for correction?

Choose A or B and paste the paragraph (or your new version). I’ll respond with short, actionable feedback and help you finalize the paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T14:34:29.543Z

**You:** I choose A,and follow is my second paragraph: To mitigate the short term job displacement risk, we should enhance our professional capabilities by mastering skills that AI automation can’t replicate , such as emotional intelligence and critical thinking. This helps us demonstrate unique value to employers and secure our positions. Also, we can learn to leverage AI automation more effectively , while we possess these irreplaceable traits, we can use AI to gather information and build skills , empowering us to complete tasks we previously could not handle.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T14:53:28.293Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — good work sharing the paragraph. Before we revise the paragraph, one quick step: please paste the single thesis sentence you want to use for this essay (or tell me if you want to keep the Current Revised Version thesis you showed earlier). We need the thesis confirmed so the topic sentence clearly links to it.

While you paste or confirm the thesis, here is focused feedback on your paragraph and a short plan for revisions.

Quick positive note
- Your paragraph has a clear solution (reskilling) and gives concrete examples of human skills (empathy, critical thinking). That’s a strong start.

Feedback on the topic sentence (line 1)
- Current: “To mitigate the short term job displacement risk, we should enhance our professional capabilities by mastering skills that AI automation can’t replicate , such as emotional intelligence and critical thinking.”
- What’s good: It addresses the solution and names skills — relevant to the thesis.
- What to improve:
  - Hyphenate “short-term.”
  - Avoid “AI automation” (use “automation” or “AI”) and remove extra spaces/commas.
  - Replace “mastering skills” with a stronger academic verb: develop, acquire, or build.
  - Make the effect explicit (what will happen if we upskill?) — e.g., “to reduce displacement” or “to secure employment.”
  - Prefer formal language: “cannot” instead of “can’t.”

Topic-sentence template (fill the blanks)
- “[Action] to [specific effect], because humans offer [unique traits/skills] that automation cannot replicate.”
Model topic-sentence (example you can use or adapt)
- “To reduce short-term job displacement, workers should develop skills such as emotional intelligence and critical thinking because these human abilities complement automation and cannot be replaced by machines.”

Now brief line-by-line notes for the rest of the paragraph
- Sentence 2: “This helps us demonstrate unique value to employers and secure our positions.”
  - Good and clear. For academic tone, change “us” to “workers” or “employees,” and “secure our positions” to “secure employment” or “maintain job security.”
  - Small template: “This allows workers to [demonstrate X], increasing their likelihood of [keeping/obtaining] higher-value roles.”

- Sentence 3 (run-on): “Also, we can learn to leverage AI automation more effectively , while we possess these irreplaceable traits, we can use AI to gather information and build skills , empowering us to complete tasks we previously could not handle.”
  - Issues: run-on; repeated “AI automation”; awkward phrasing (“while we possess these irreplaceable traits”).
  - Fix by splitting into two sentences and clarifying the logic:
    - First: say we should learn to use automation effectively.
    - Second: explain how automation helps (gather information, practice skills) and connect to the main effect (complete new tasks/shift to higher-value work).
  - Template pair:
    - “Moreover, workers should learn to leverage automation tools effectively to complement their unique skills.”
    - “By using AI to gather information and practice new tasks, employees can acquire technical competencies that enable them to move into higher-value roles.”

Language and grammar checklist for this paragraph
- Use “short-term” (hyphen), “cannot” (not “can’t”), “workers/employees” (instead of “us”), “automation” or “AI” (not both).
- Remove extra spaces before commas and after words.
- Break long sentences into two when they contain more than one main idea.
- Prefer formal academic verbs: develop, acquire, leverage, complement, secure.

Next step (your turn)
1) Please paste or confirm the thesis you will use (we need this before finalizing the topic sentence).
2) Then try revising the topic sentence now — either (a) rewrite your topic sentence using the template/model, or (b) paste an improved version of the whole paragraph if you want. I’ll give quick focused feedback and help correct grammar and word choice.

Would you like to try the topic-sentence rewrite now?

**You:** I have completed all the revisions. The article is as follows: With the development of automation, many routine jobs may no longer require large workforces, as fewer workers translate to higher revenue and greater efficiency. This technological shift ultimately has mixed effects on long-term global employment prospects: it undermines short-term job security by replacing these routine roles, enhances opportunities via productivity-driven new job creation, and creates demand for reskilled workers in AI-complementary roles.

To mitigate the short-term job displacement risk,we should enhance our professional capabilities by mastering skills that AI automation can’t replicate,such as emotional intelligence and critical thinking. This helps us demonstrate unique value to employers and secure our positions. Also,we can learn to leverage AI automation more effectively,while we possess these irreplaceable traits, we can use AI to gather information and build skills , empowering us to complete tasks we previously could not handle.

Finally, while job displacement is unavoidable, we can learn to use AI automation appropriately and use it to enhance our own capabilities , we only need the willingness to adapt. In doing so, we can’t only protect our employment but also boost our productivity. 
Do you think there is anything else that needs to be revised?

**Assistant:** Nice work — you’ve already fixed many big problems (clearer position, stronger structure, and a workable solution). Quick, focused feedback and a suggested next step so we can make the piece even better.

Short diagnostic (tied to your chosen targets: clear thesis + language accuracy)
- Strengths: Clear stance (mixed effects), good preview of three reasons, and a relevant solution (reskilling + learning to use AI).
- Main remaining issues (high priority)
  1. Grammar, punctuation and spacing: missing spaces after commas, hyphenate “short-term,” use “cannot” (not “can’t”), and correct sentence boundaries (several run-ons).
  2. Word choice and repetition: avoid “AI automation” (use “automation” or “AI”); use academic vocabulary (reskill/upskill, complementarity, displacement).
  3. Cohesion and clarity: one or two sentences are long/run-on and need splitting to make the logic clearer.
  4. Conclusion phrasing and logic: small grammar error and a clearer contrast structure (“not only… but also…”) would make the final sentence stronger.

Do you want to focus on everything above, or prioritize only one or two items now? (Choose one)
- A: Tighten the thesis (one final polish) and then topic sentence + paragraph 2 content (recommended)
- B: Fix all grammar/punctuation across the essay
- C: Improve vocabulary and cohesion (word choice, repetition, sentence boundaries)
Tell me which (A, B, or C) you want to do next.

If you pick A (recommended), we’ll follow our three-step process. Quick Step 1 guidance now (thesis)
- Your current thesis is strong in content, but it can be tightened for concision and style. Small polish ideas:
  - Remove any remaining repetition (“automation” once is usually enough).
  - Use precise verbs (undermines / enhances / has mixed effects).
  - Keep it one sentence if possible and let it preview the 2–3 reasons clearly.
- Template you can use (fill the blanks, do not copy wholesale):
  - “Automation ultimately has mixed effects on long-term global employment because it [displaces routine jobs], [increases productivity and creates new roles], and [raises demand for reskilled workers].”
Would you like to try revising your thesis now using that template? Paste one sentence. I’ll give a very short, focused suggestion (only micro-edits).

Quick hints for paragraph 2 (topic sentence + content) so you can revise after the thesis
- Topic-sentence template:
  - “[Action] to [specific effect], because humans provide [unique traits/skills] that automation cannot replicate.”
  - Example fill-ins to adapt: “To reduce short-term job displacement, workers should develop emotional intelligence and critical thinking because these abilities complement automation and are not replicable by machines.”
- Supporting-sentence templates (use to replace each long/run-on sentence):
  - Explanation: “This matters because ________, which automation cannot replicate.”
  - Example + link: “For example, ________. As a result, ________.”
  - Transition to next idea: “Moreover, ________, which further supports the need to ________.”

A few concrete micro-edits you can make in paragraph 2 once you rewrite:
- Change “short term” → “short-term” (hyphen).
- Use “workers” or “employees” instead of “us.”
- Change “can’t” → “cannot.”
- Split the long run-on sentence into two: one about learning to leverage automation, one about how automation helps build skills.

Next step (your turn)
- Confirm A, B, or C.
- If A: paste the single-sentence thesis you want to use (or revise it now using the template). I’ll give one quick focused edit suggestion, then we’ll move to the paragraph topic sentence and the paragraph content.

**You:** I choose A

*Time:* 2025-11-22T15:12:25.085Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming A. Let’s do Step 1 now.

Please paste the single-sentence thesis you want to use (you can paste the thesis from your Current Revised Version or try a new one now). Quick reminders as you write it:

- Drop hedging (no “I think”).
- State a clear position (e.g., “automation ultimately has mixed effects on long-term global employment”).
- Preview 2–3 reasons you will develop (e.g., displacement of routine jobs; productivity and new job creation; increased demand for reskilled workers).
- Keep it concise and assertive.

If you prefer, try this frame and fill the blanks in one sentence:
“Automation ultimately [enhances | undermines | has mixed effects on] long-term global employment because it [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”

Paste your thesis sentence now and I’ll give short, focused feedback and one micro-suggestion for improvement. Would you like me to show a model only after you try your own version?
