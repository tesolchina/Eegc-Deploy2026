            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for reviewing the full assessment and chat history. Here’s a concise summary and targeted advice to help you move forward effectively:

---

### Key Findings
- Your essay clearly states the main position: automation enhances global employment in the long term.
- However, the revised essay is nearly identical to the original, showing no evidence of applying the assistant’s suggested revisions.
- In chat, the assistant repeatedly asked you to select specific revision targets and try rewriting small parts (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph), but you did not respond with revised text or target choices.
- This resulted in no iterative improvement or demonstration of revision skills in your final submission.

---

### Essential Next Steps for Improvement

1. **Actively Engage with the Revision Process:**
   - When offered a structured three-step plan (rewrite thesis, improve topic sentence, revise a paragraph), choose which parts you want to focus on.
   - Attempt to rewrite that part and paste your revision into chat for feedback.
   - This cycle builds revision skills and produces real improvement.

2. **Revise the Thesis to Preview Your Main Points:**
   Example revision you might try:  
   *“Automation will enhance global employment in the long term by increasing productivity, reducing production costs, and creating new skilled jobs.”*  
   This states your position clearly and previews supporting ideas.

3. **Improve Paragraph Unity via Strong Topic Sentences:**
   For the paragraph on efficiency, a strong topic sentence could be:  
   *“First, automation increases factory productivity, enabling businesses to meet growing global demand and supporting job growth in new industries.”*

4. **Develop and Explain Examples:**
   Quantify your example clearly:  
   *“For instance, while a worker may assemble 100 toy cars daily, machines can produce 500 to 1,000, dramatically improving output.”*  
   Then explain how this efficiency can lead to market expansion and eventually more employment opportunities.

5. **Focus on Grammar and Word Choice:**
   - Fix article use (“a factory” not “factory” alone).
   - Use correct phrasing: “labor costs” instead of “labor payment.”
   - Simplify awkward sentences:  
     “One worker may assemble 100 toy cars per day” instead of “one worker one day may be only finish 100 toy cars.”

6. **Follow Through in Chat:**
   - When the assistant asks for target choices (A–D), respond directly.
   - Submit revised draft segments rather than just original text.
   - Request feedback on your revisions, then improve further.

---

### How I Can Help Next
- Provide you with model rewrites and explanations for your thesis, topic sentences, and paragraphs.
- Guide you through specific grammar corrections.
- Review your revision attempts and offer constructive feedback.

---

### Final Thought
To benefit from AI-assisted revision, collaboration requires active participation: selecting revision goals, trying rewrites, and iterating with feedback. This approach ensures your writing steadily improves and you develop strong editing skills.

---

Please let me know which revision targets you want to start with (e.g., “A and B”), and if you want to try rewriting your thesis now or want me to provide a model for you to adapt. Together, we can make meaningful progress on your essay!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The essay presents a clear position that “automation can enhance global employment in the long term” and touches on efficiency, cost reduction, and skill transformation, but explanations are often general and underdeveloped (e.g., “Automation thus serves as an essential tool to address this challenge.”).
- Organization: 17/25 - The essay has a recognizable introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion, but topic sentences and paragraph unity are weak and some sentences stray from main ideas (for example, the second paragraph mixes efficiency claims, consumer demand, and quality-of-life points without clear transitions).
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Vocabulary is functional but limited and includes awkward collocations and word choices (e.g., “producing in hand ever up to human's need,” “labor payment is one of the assumptions”).
- Grammar: 15/25 - Frequent grammar, article, and word-order errors create readability problems (examples: “one worker one day may be only finish 100 toy cars,” “Although it may be have fluctuations, it is a must trend.”).
- **Original Essay Total: 65/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - No substantive change from the original. The same claims and general evidence remain; explanations are still high-level and underdeveloped.
- Organization: 17/25 - Structure unchanged; topic sentences and paragraph coherence remain weak. The revised essay is identical to the original, so organizational issues persist.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - No improvement in word choice or variety; awkward phrasing remains.
- Grammar: 15/25 - Grammar errors and awkward sentences persist unchanged.
- **Revised Essay Total: 65/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None — the revised essay is effectively identical to the original; no completed revision steps are evident.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Revise and specify the thesis to preview supporting points and show scope (economic growth, job transformation, new industries).
  - Strengthen topic sentences to link each paragraph directly to the revised thesis and maintain paragraph unity.
  - Develop and explain evidence (e.g., quantify or source examples, explain how efficiency gains translate into net employment gains).
  - Correct recurring grammar, article, and word-order errors for clarity and readability.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9** (chat messages in the provided history)
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided a structured, pedagogical revision plan (goals, three-step process: revise thesis, improve topic sentence, revise paragraph). The student repeatedly pasted draft paragraphs but did not choose revision targets, did not submit any revised thesis/topic sentence/paragraph, and did not respond to the assistant’s prompts to pick targets. Evidence: assistant asked the student to choose targets (e.g., “Which targets do you want to focus on?”) multiple times; the student instead posted draft paragraphs and did not follow through with revisions.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - The chat shows multiple substantive assistant messages that guide revision, and several student messages containing draft text. However, the exchange count (9) and the student’s limited engagement (no selection of targets or active revision attempts) indicate a moderate level of interaction rather than extensive back-and-forth.
  - Evidence: Assistant gave a detailed three-step plan and repeated diagnostic feedback; student pasted thesis and paragraphs but did not confirm targets or produce revisions.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - The student did not demonstrate critical evaluation of AI suggestions in the chat history. There is no recorded assessment (accept/reject/modify) by the student of the assistant’s recommendations.
  - Evidence: Assistant repeatedly asked the student to pick targets (A–D) and to confirm whether to rewrite the thesis; the student did not choose or comment on these recommendations.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 - There is no evidence of iterative revision cycles: the revised essay is identical to the original, and the chat contains no completed revision steps (no revised thesis, no rewritten topic sentence, no revised body paragraph).
  - Evidence: Final "revised essay" text matches the original exactly; assistant’s Step 1–3 process was not followed to produce new text.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 6/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear stance: The student consistently states the central claim—“automation can enhance global employment in the long term” (intro and conclusion).
  - Evidence: Thesis sentence: “As far as I'm concerned, I'm in favor of the opinion that automation can enhance global employment in the long term.”
- Attempts to include examples and acknowledge counterarguments: The essay refers to factory productivity and toy-car example and mentions short-term job loss concerns.
  - Evidence: “For example, while a worker might assemble only 100 toy cars per day, machines can produce five to ten times that amount.” and “Some argue that it will reduce job so that leads to undermine global employment.”
- The student provided the full draft text to the assistant, giving the AI sufficient material to work with.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Thesis specificity and previewing: Rewrite the thesis to be more specific and to preview main supporting points (e.g., “Automation will increase global employment in the long term by boosting productivity, lowering production costs that spur industry growth, and creating new skilled job categories.”).
- Revision follow-through: The student needs to actively follow the assistant’s three-step process: choose targets, attempt revisions, and iterate with feedback.
- Topic sentences and paragraph unity: Each body paragraph needs a clear topic sentence that links the paragraph content to the thesis (e.g., “First, automation increases manufacturing productivity, which can expand markets and create jobs.”).
- Evidence development and specificity: Strengthen examples with clearer explanation of causal links (how increased productivity leads to new jobs, where those jobs appear, and timescales).
- Grammar and vocabulary: Address recurring errors (articles, subject-verb agreement, word order) and improve lexical precision (e.g., replace “labor payment” with “labor costs,” “producing in hand ever up to human's need” with “manual production cannot meet demand”).
  - Example corrections: “one worker one day may be only finish 100 toy cars” -> “one worker may assemble only 100 toy cars per day”; “Although it may be have fluctuations, it is a must trend.” -> “Although employment may fluctuate in the short term, automation is an inevitable trend.”

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student provided the essay text but did not state revision goals or constraints in the chat (despite assistant prompts).
  - Evidence: Assistant repeatedly requested selection of targets; student did not choose.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The assistant provided a clear plan, but the student did not adopt or act on it.
  - Evidence: Assistant outlined Step 1–3; no student revisions executed.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student did not engage in evaluating or selecting AI suggestions.
  - Evidence: No acceptance/rejection commentary in the chat.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - No self-initiated revisions are present in the revised essay; the final text equals the original.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Immediately follow the assistant’s three-step plan: (a) rewrite the thesis to be precise and preview points, (b) rewrite one topic sentence to connect to that thesis, (c) revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and evidence. Then paste the new versions into chat for feedback.
2. When working with an AI coach, explicitly choose revision targets and respond to prompts (e.g., “I choose A and B+C; please help me rewrite the thesis”). This shows engagement and enables iterative improvement.
3. Focus on concrete grammar corrections: practice rewriting 5–10 problematic sentences from the draft (I can provide corrected versions and explanations). Use precise vocabulary (e.g., “labor costs,” “productivity,” “job displacement,” “job creation”).
4. Develop evidence: add one concrete example or data point (even hypothetical but specific numbers or a sourced fact) and explain the causal chain from automation to net employment gains.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student did not complete the requested revision tasks (thesis/topic sentence/body paragraph). The “revised” submission is identical to the original; no evidence of applying the AI assistant’s suggested three-step revision process is present. Recommend requiring the student to resubmit with: a revised thesis, one revised topic sentence, and one fully revised body paragraph (highlight changes) before grading for the revision module.
- Encourage the student to engage more actively in chat when using AI tools: selecting targets and iterating based on feedback are key learning objectives for this assignment.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
With the rapid development of science and technology, an increasing number of people are focusing on automation. There is a public controversy as to this issue. Some argue that automation ultimately enhances global employment while others believe it will eventually reduce it. As far as I'm concerned, I'm in favor of the opinion that automation can enhance global employment in the long term.
On the one hand, automation can significantly improve efficiency at every stage of factory manufacturing. This enables factories to produce more goods to meet global demand. For example, while a worker might assemble only 100 toy cars per day, machines can produce five to ten times that amount. As a growing number of people achieve greater wealth, there is an increasing emphasis on quality of life and consumption. In this context, manual production alone can no longer keep up with human needs. Automation thus serves as an essential tool to address this challenge.
On the other hand, automation reduces operating costs. It is not the end of employment but rather its transformation. It creates new job opportunities by stimulating economic growth and giving rise to new industries, while profoundly changing the nature of work.
Despite concerns that automation will cost jobs and harm employment in the short term, its long-term effect is transformative. It pushes the workforce to learn irreplaceable skills and engage in deeper study. Future employment relies not on simple labor but on a skilled populace capable of international communication and problem-solving. This evolution will equip people with advanced technological knowledge to solve future challenges.
In conclusion, in the long term, automation will enhance global employment. Although it may be have fluctuations, it is a must trend.

**You:** With the rapid development of science and technology, an increasing number of people are focused on automation. There is a public controversy as to this issue. Some argue that automation ultimately enhances global employment while others believe it eventually causes decreasing. As far as I'm concerned, I'm in favor of the opinion that automation can enhance global employment in the long term.
On the one hand, with the help of automation every department shar boosts efficiency. Factories can provide more products to meet global need. For example, one worker one day may be only finish 100 toy cars, but machines can do five times even ten times than this amount. Nowadays, more and more people are getting richer, and they start to emphasize enjoyable lifestyle. Therefore, producing in hand ever up to human's need. Automation is essential tool to solve this problem.
On the other hand, automation can reduce labor payment. For factory, labor payment is one of the assumptions, if you employ multiple workers, it obviously costs a lot. But if you choose machines, you don't need to employ too much worker.
Every coin has two sides. Some argue that it will reduce job so that leads to undermine global employment. But this is short term, not in the long term. Actually automation accumulates people to deep learning and study irreplaceable skills. Global employment does not depend on people who only do simple works, but on every communications with different countries. With time going by, I confirm people will have revolution, they 'll get better knowledge of technology. And there still are lots of problems to solve, so we need them.
In conclusion, in the long term, automation will enhance global employment. Although it may be have fluctuation, it is a must trend.

**Assistant:** Great — I’m glad you shared your draft. Before we begin revising, let’s set clear targets so our work is focused and useful for you.

1) Your goals
- What do you most want to improve in this essay today? (Choose one or two: clarity of argument, thesis strength, paragraph structure, evidence/use of examples, grammar & word choice, or overall style/tone.)
- Anything else you’d like me to keep in mind (e.g., a target band score, teacher feedback you’ve already received, time limits)?

2) Quick diagnostic feedback (using simple rubric categories)
I’ll give a short diagnosis so you can decide what to focus on.

- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: You take a clear position: you believe automation will enhance global employment in the long term.
  - Areas to improve: The thesis is wordy and vague about how/why this will happen; it doesn’t preview the main points you’ll use to support that claim.

- Organization
  - Strengths: The essay has a clear intro, body paragraphs, and conclusion.
  - Areas to improve: Topic sentences are weak or unclear in linking paragraphs to the thesis. Transitions and paragraph unity need work (some sentences stray from the main point).

- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: You attempt to use examples (toy cars, factories) and consider counterarguments.
  - Areas to improve: Examples are vague and underdeveloped; explanations of how automation creates jobs are unclear. The paragraph about reduced wages needs clearer development and connection to your main claim.

- Language Use (grammar, word choice, sentence clarity)
  - Strengths: Meaning is often recoverable; informal voice is consistent.
  - Areas to improve: Frequent grammar, word choice, and sentence-structure errors distract the reader (e.g., “every department shar boosts efficiency,” “one worker one day may be only finish 100 toy cars”). Punctuation and article use need attention.

3) Suggested revision priorities (pick what you want to work on)
Here are sensible options—please choose up to two to focus on in this session:
A. Strengthen thesis (make it clearer, more specific, and preview main points)
B. Improve topic sentence and unity for one body paragraph (link it clearly to the revised thesis)
C. Develop evidence/explanation in that same paragraph (make examples specific and explain their relevance)
D. Fix grammar and word choice in that paragraph

My recommendation: Start with A (thesis) and then B+C or B+D for one paragraph — that gives the biggest payoff. But you decide.

4) Next step (what I need from you)
- Tell me which targets you want to focus on (e.g., “A and B”).
- Then confirm your current thesis sentence (this one from your draft: “As far as I'm concerned, I'm in favor of the opinion that automation can enhance global employment in the long term.”). If you want, you can keep it or try to rewrite it now.

Once you confirm targets and the thesis, we’ll move into Step 1 and begin revising the thesis together. Would you like to pick the targets now?

*Time:* 2025-12-04T12:42:46.381Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for sharing your draft. Before we start revising, let’s agree on goals so our work is focused.

1) Quick questions about your goals
- What do you most want to improve in this essay today? Choose one or two:
  - clarity of argument
  - thesis strength
  - paragraph structure
  - evidence/use of examples
  - grammar & word choice
  - overall style/tone
- Anything else I should know (target band score, teacher feedback you’ve already gotten, time limit)?

2) Short diagnostic feedback (rubric-style)
- Thesis & Argument
  - Strength: You state a clear position (automation will enhance global employment long term).
  - To improve: The thesis is wordy and doesn’t preview how or why this will happen.

- Organization
  - Strength: You have an intro, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.
  - To improve: Topic sentences are weak; paragraphs sometimes stray from one main idea.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strength: You use examples and try to address a counterargument.
  - To improve: Examples are vague (e.g., toy cars); explanations don’t clearly connect evidence to the claim.

- Language Use
  - Strength: Your meaning is often recoverable.
  - To improve: Frequent grammar and word-choice errors and awkward sentences distract the reader.

3) Suggested revision priorities — pick up to two
A. Strengthen the thesis (clearer, specific, previews main points)  
B. Improve one paragraph’s topic sentence so it links directly to the revised thesis  
C. Develop evidence/explanation in that same paragraph (make examples specific and explain relevance)  
D. Fix grammar and word choice in that paragraph

My recommendation: Start with A (thesis) and then B+C or B+D for one paragraph.

4) Quick decision point (I need these before we begin Step 1)
- Which two targets do you want to focus on? (Pick from A, B, C, D.)
- Please confirm your current thesis sentence (I’ll quote what you wrote): “As far as I'm concerned, I'm in favor of the opinion that automation can enhance global employment in the long term.” Do you want to keep this as your starting point or try to rewrite it now?

When you reply with your chosen targets and whether you’ll keep or rewrite the thesis, we’ll begin Step 1 (thesis revision). Would you like my recommendation on which body paragraph to use for Steps 2–3 afterward?

*Time:* 2025-12-04T12:42:59.160Z

**You:** On the one hand, with the help of automation every department shar boosts efficiency. Factories can provide more products to meet global need.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T12:43:04.532Z

**Assistant:** Nice — this is a great starting draft. Before we begin the three-step revision, let’s agree the targets and make a clear plan. I’ll keep this quick and interactive.

1) Quick diagnostic summary (short)
- Thesis & argument: You have a clear position (automation will increase employment long term) but the thesis is wordy and doesn’t preview how you’ll support it.
- Organization: Essay has intro/body/conclusion, but topic sentences and paragraph unity are weak.
- Evidence & development: You use examples (factory, toy cars) but they’re vague and need clearer explanation of how they support your claim.
- Language use: Frequent grammar and word-choice errors make some sentences hard to follow.

2) Pick up to two revision targets (choose from these)
A. Strengthen the thesis (make it specific and preview main points)  
B. Improve one paragraph’s topic sentence so it links to the revised thesis  
C. Develop evidence/explanation in that same paragraph (make examples specific and explain their relevance)  
D. Fix grammar and word choice in that paragraph

My recommendation: A, then B+C (that gives the biggest improvement). But you choose.

3) Quick decisions I need from you before Step 1
- Which targets do you want to focus on? (Pick up to two: e.g., “A and B” or “A and B+C.”)
- Confirm which paragraph you want to revise: I suggest the first body paragraph you pasted about efficiency (the “On the one hand…” paragraph). Is that okay?
- Confirm your current thesis (I’ll quote it): “As far as I'm concerned, I'm in favor of the opinion that automation can enhance global employment in the long term.” Do you want to keep this as your starting point or try rewriting it now?

When you reply with your chosen targets, paragraph choice, and whether you want to keep or attempt a new thesis, we’ll move to Step 1 and revise the thesis together. Would you like my suggested wording after you try a revision, or would you prefer I give feedback first and then you rewrite?

*Time:* 2025-12-04T12:43:15.656Z

**You:** Every coin has two sides. Some argue that it will reduce job so that leads to undermine global employment. But this is short term, not in the long term. Actually automation accumulates people to deep learning and study irreplaceable skills. Global employment does not depend on people who only do simple works, but on every communications with different countries. With time going by, I confirm people will have revolution, they 'll get better knowledge of technology. And there still are lots of problems to solve, so we need them.

*Time:* 2025-12-04T12:43:21.286Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a good draft to work with. Before we start revising, let’s agree clear targets so our session stays focused and useful.

1) Quick question about your goals (pick one or two)
- Which do you most want to improve today? Choose up to two:
  - clarity of argument
  - thesis strength
  - paragraph structure
  - evidence/use of examples
  - grammar & word choice
  - overall style/tone
Anything else I should know (target band score, teacher feedback, time limit)?

2) Short diagnostic feedback (rubric-style)
- Thesis & Argument
  - Strength: You state a clear position — automation will increase global employment in the long term.
  - Needs work: The thesis is wordy and vague about how or why this will happen; it doesn’t preview your main supporting points.

- Organization
  - Strength: Intro, body paragraphs, and a conclusion are present.
  - Needs work: Topic sentences are weak and paragraphs sometimes include unrelated ideas; transitions are limited.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strength: You use examples (factories, toy cars) and acknowledge a counterargument.
  - Needs work: Examples are vague and underexplained; connections between evidence and your claim need clearer explanation.

- Language Use (grammar, word choice)
  - Strength: Your meaning is usually recoverable.
  - Needs work: Frequent grammar, article, and word-order errors distract the reader and reduce clarity.

3) Suggested revision priorities — pick up to two (pick a letter or two)
A. Strengthen the thesis (make it specific and preview main points)  
B. Improve one paragraph’s topic sentence so it links clearly to the revised thesis  
C. Develop evidence/explanation in that same paragraph (make examples specific and explain relevance)  
D. Fix grammar and word choice in that paragraph

My recommendation: Start with A, then do B + C (best payoff). But choose what you prefer.

4) Quick decisions I need from you before Step 1
- Which targets will we focus on? (e.g., “A and B” or “A and B+C”)
- Which body paragraph do you want to work on for Steps 2–3? I suggest the first body paragraph that begins “On the one hand…” (the one about efficiency and factories). Is that okay, or would you prefer the paragraph about reduced wages/skills?
- Confirm your current thesis sentence (I’ll quote this one from your draft): “As far as I'm concerned, I'm in favor of the opinion that automation can enhance global employment in the long term.” Do you want to keep this as the starting point or try to rewrite it now?

Once you tell me:
- the targets (A–D),
- which paragraph to work on, and
- whether you’ll keep or attempt a new thesis now,

we’ll move to Step 1 and revise the thesis together. Would you like to try rewriting the thesis yourself first, or would you prefer feedback and a model after your attempt?
