            ## Contribution Analysis

            It looks like you requested a revision of the entire essay directly, but our process and your improved draft show it’s best to work step-by-step: first revising the thesis, then a topic sentence and paragraph, to ensure clarity and strong organization.

Since you already have a well-revised essay (from earlier exchanges), here is a polished, final version of that revised essay with improved flow, clarity, and a stronger conclusion, plus a sample brief counterargument to add nuance—as recommended in your assessment report:

**Revised Final Essay:**

Automation is transforming how economies produce goods and services, and it raises serious concerns about long-term employment. Automation undermines global employment opportunities because it replaces routine tasks, reshapes industry structures, and widens skill gaps between workers.

First, automation reduces job opportunities by taking over routine and repetitive tasks. Machines now perform factory assembly, basic data sorting, and simple service tasks faster and more accurately than people. As a result, many low-skill workers face shrinking job options unless they can retrain for more complex work.

Second, automation changes how industries operate. When companies adopt new technologies, they often reorganize production and require fewer workers. For example, automated warehouses reduce the need for traditional logistics staff but increase demand for technicians and engineers. This shift benefits highly skilled workers but leaves others behind.

Finally, automation has become a global trend, increasing pressure on countries to upgrade their technological capabilities. Economies that cannot adapt may lose competitiveness, which further harms employment. Emerging markets, in particular, face the challenge of balancing technological adoption with protecting workers’ livelihoods.

Although automation creates challenges, it can also generate new job opportunities in technology development, system maintenance, and innovation. To ensure that automation benefits society, coordinated policies focusing on education and retraining are essential. Governments, industries, and workers must work together to manage the transition and secure inclusive economic growth.

In the long term, societies need to implement comprehensive skills training and support systems to help workers adapt. Only through proactive collaboration can automation be a tool for progress without undermining global job security.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

1. **Add Concrete Evidence or Statistics:**  
   Include at least one data point or example (e.g., “A 2019 study found that 30% of routine jobs in manufacturing have been automated worldwide.”). This strengthens credibility.

2. **Stronger Conclusion:**  
   The above conclusion summarizes implications, acknowledges a counterargument, and suggests solutions, making the essay more persuasive.

3. **Vocabulary and Grammar:**  
   Maintain careful proofreading to avoid misspellings and ensure subject–verb agreement, articles, and plural forms are correct.

4. **Critical Engagement:**  
   Next time, paste your revisions into the chat and explain why you accept or change suggestions to deepen critical review skills and demonstrate collaboration.

If you want, I can also help you:

- Draft a concluding paragraph based on this model,  
- Insert a specific example or statistic with a citation, or  
- Work on any remaining grammar or vocabulary details.  

Just let me know which step you'd like to take next!

            ---

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 15/25 - The draft expresses a central opinion (automation harms jobs) but ideas are vague, repetitive, and underdeveloped. The mention of a “chart” is not explained.
- Organization: 15/25 - There is an attempt at paragraphing (causes, influence, range), but topic sentences and logical links are weak; many sentences repeat rather than develop points.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Vocabulary attempts to cover relevant concepts, but frequent misspellings and word-choice errors (e.g., “technelogefal,” “enterpeishp,” “satis does faction”) reduce clarity.
- Grammar: 12/25 - Many grammar errors (subject–verb agreement, fragments, article use) substantially impede readability.
- **Original Essay Total: 57/100**

Evidence (original): “In my opinion this technological shift undermine global employment prospects in the long term.” (grammar error, weak phrasing) and misspellings like “technelogefal.”

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised essay states a clear position and gives three concrete reasons: replacement of routine tasks, reshaped industry structures, and widened skill gaps. These reasons are relevant and logically connected to the thesis, though the piece would be stronger with one or two concrete examples or data points.
- Organization: 21/25 - The essay now has a clear introduction, three well-ordered body paragraphs each with an explicit topic sentence (“First…”, “Second…”, “Finally…”), and a short concluding sentence. Transitions are present and logical.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Vocabulary is more precise (e.g., “job security,” “automated warehouses,” “technicians and engineers”). Some repetition remains, but overall word choice is appropriate and accurate.
- Grammar: 21/25 - Grammar, sentence structure, and verb agreement are corrected and mostly accurate; sentences are clearer and some variety is present.
- **Revised Essay Total: 83/100**

Evidence (revised): Thesis — “Automation is transforming how economies produce goods and services, and it raises serious concerns about long-term employment. Automation undermines global employment opportunities because it replaces routine tasks, reshapes industry structures, and widens skill gaps between workers.” Topic sentence example — “Second, automation changes how industries operate.” Body paragraph excerpt — “When companies adopt new technologies, they often reorganize production and require fewer workers. For example, automated warehouses reduce the need for traditional logistics staff but increase demand for technicians and engineers.”

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +26 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Stronger, grammatically correct thesis that previews reasons.
  - Clear topic sentences for each body paragraph and improved paragraph unity.
  - Substantive grammar and vocabulary corrections producing clearer sentences.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Add concrete examples, statistics, or a citation (e.g., a specific study or data point) to support claims.
  - Develop a more forceful concluding paragraph that summarizes implications and suggests solutions/policies.
  - Add a brief counterargument or nuance (e.g., how automation can create new jobs) and rebuttal to strengthen critical thinking.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 12**
- **Conversation Quality:** Functional and task-focused: the assistant guided a structured revision process (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), and the student repeatedly requested specific revisions ("please revise thesis statement", "please Revise topic sentences", "please revise one body paragraph", "please Revise the rest of the essay"). However, the student provided minimal in-chat drafts or critical evaluation; most messages were brief requests rather than iterative edits.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Moderate depth. There are multiple exchanges (12 messages) and the assistant provided clear process guidance and diagnostic feedback, but the student did not engage in extended, multi-level questioning or supply iterative drafts within the chat.
  - Evidence: Assistant laid out a three-step revision process and diagnostic feedback; student usually replied with single short requests rather than drafting iterations.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - Basic. The chat shows few examples of the student critically accepting, rejecting, or justifying AI suggestions. The student mostly requested services rather than evaluating options.
  - Evidence: The student asked the assistant to "please revise..." repeatedly without accepting, rejecting, or discussing suggested alternatives.
- **Refining Process**: 3/5 - Developing. The assistant attempted an iterative process and asked the student to revise step-by-step, but the student did not paste intermediate revised sentences into the chat or show stepwise edits. Still, a revised essay exists showing some revision occurred—however, the chat lacks evidence of multiple student-led iterations.
  - Evidence: Assistant requested thesis rewrite and paragraph selection multiple times; the student did not post interim drafts in the chat.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 8/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear stance and improved thesis in the revised essay: the final thesis precisely lists reasons (“replaces routine tasks, reshapes industry structures, and widens skill gaps”).
- Improved organization and paragraph-level clarity: body paragraphs now begin with explicit topic sentences and follow a logical sequence.
- Willingness to seek help and follow a revision process: the student repeatedly asked for assistance and received structured guidance from the assistant.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Evidence & development: incorporate at least one concrete example, statistic, or brief case to support claims. Recommendation: add a sentence such as “For example, a 2019 study found X% of routine jobs were automated in sector Y.”
- Active engagement in revision: paste draft revisions into the chat and explain why you accept or change the AI’s suggestions to demonstrate critical evaluation.
- Concluding and nuance: strengthen the conclusion and add a sentence acknowledging potential benefits of automation and how policy/education could mediate risks.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement — The chat shows minimal context about the assignment prompt (the assistant asked about a climate prompt mismatch, but the student did not clarify). Evidence: assistant repeatedly asked whether to keep automation topic vs rewrite for climate; student did not explicitly confirm context.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good — The assistant provided a clear stepwise revision plan and the student followed through to produce a revised essay.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement — The student did not document reasons for accepting/rejecting suggestions in the chat.
- **Independent Editing**: Developing — Revised essay shows substantial correction, but chat lacks evidence of student-led line-by-line edits or justification.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Add specific evidence and one brief example or statistic to at least one body paragraph to strengthen claims and credibility.
2. In chat revision sessions, paste your revision attempts (thesis/topic sentence/body paragraph) and explicitly say which AI suggestions you accept or reject and why — this builds critical-review skills.
3. Develop a stronger conclusion that summarizes implications and suggests actions (policy, education, retraining) and include a brief counterargument/rebuttal to show nuance.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The assistant asked about a possible mismatch between the course prompt (climate-change focus) and the student's automation topic. The student kept automation as the topic; please confirm whether that aligns with the assignment expectations.
- The revised essay is substantially clearer and more organized; however, encourage the student to show more active engagement in the chat (pasting drafts and justifying choices) to demonstrate AI-collaboration learning objectives.
- If grading for revision process, note the chat shows limited evidence of student-critical evaluation even though the final writing product is improved.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Automation is a key shift in boosting efficiency. In my opinion this technological shift undermine global employment prospects in the long term.

For the time, this shift must be the long term. First, the technology development is a difficult things, which needs time, money, knowledge and so on. Second, different countries have different situation, the matters about citizen’s satis does faction economic suit the expanse of technoglay.

For the influence, the technological shift has two cons of it. It not only can transforming industries but also can reduce jobs. We need a long term to make the most use of it’s benefit and reduce the bad side, which need polity, economic, citizenship work together.

For the range, the technelogefal shift is a global shift. First, the economic global tendency is stronger, every country’s developments are influenced by others. Second, the many key countries tendency becoming clearer. International battle is serious, every country have to development their technology ability to keep their foot in global develop- ment.

For the influence job, it not only impact the industries, but also will impact the producton, enterpeishp and so on. To extend the range is a difficult thing which needs courage to face the potential matter, long eyes to make strategies.

Based on the chart, the EM economics countries need to pay attention to this tendency, and DM economics countries need to take responsibility to help them to achieve global peace and love.

Everyone should face the shift, use it to produce more efficiency in daily life and production.

**Assistant:** Hi — I’m glad you shared this draft. Before we start revising, let’s agree learning targets and diagnose the essay so we focus our time where it will help you most.

1) Quick goals check (your turn)
- What do you most want to improve in this session? (Choose any: clarity of argument, structure and paragraphing, thesis strength, grammar and vocabulary, use of evidence, or something else.)
- Do you want to keep the current topic about automation and jobs, or do you want to rewrite the essay to answer the climate-change prompt you were given? (Right now your draft talks about automation, but the assessment question asks about individual vs government/corporate actions on climate change.)

Tell me your answers in one or two short lines.

2) Diagnostic feedback (brief, rubric-based)
I reviewed your draft against the rubric categories. Strengths first:
- You are trying to organize ideas into paragraphs and you have a clear opinion (automation will harm employment long-term).
- You attempt to consider causes, effects, and scale — that shows you are thinking about development.

Main areas to improve (clear, actionable):
- Content & Ideas: The essay doesn’t match the assigned question (climate change vs automation). Ideas are relevant to each other but underdeveloped and repetitive. You need clearer, stronger claims and supporting reasons or evidence.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Paragraphs exist but lack clear topic sentences that connect to a thesis; sentences sometimes repeat the same point instead of developing it; the essay needs a clearer introduction that answers the question and previews the main points.
- Vocabulary: Many spelling and word-choice errors (e.g., “technelogefal,” “enterpeishp,” “satis does faction”) make meaning unclear. You need more precise academic vocabulary.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Frequent errors (verb agreement, articles, sentence fragments) distract the reader and reduce credibility.
- Evidence & Development (linked to rubric): You don’t give concrete examples, data, or clear explanation of the “chart” you mention. Claims need support and explanation.

3) Choose revision priorities (your turn)
Pick up to two main targets for today’s session (examples below). I recommend focusing on at most two so we can do deep, interactive work.
- A. Make the essay answer the assigned question (reframe to climate-change prompt) OR keep automation topic (your choice).
- B. Revise the thesis so it clearly answers the question and previews the essay.
- C. Improve the topic sentence and unity of one body paragraph.
- D. Fix the grammar and vocabulary that most affect clarity (verb agreement, spelling).
- E. Add clearer support/evidence for one paragraph.

Which two (or one) would you like to focus on? Also confirm whether we should rewrite the essay to fit the climate prompt or continue with automation.

When you confirm, we’ll move to Step 1. If you want to proceed immediately, paste the sentence you want to use as your current thesis (or say you want to write a new one) — then I’ll give feedback and ask you to try a revision.

*Time:* 2025-11-25T15:24:00.344Z

**You:** OK，please revise thesis statement,give some suggestions.

*Time:* 2025-11-25T15:53:39.846Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for that. Before I give feedback, two quick confirmations so we focus correctly:

1) Do you want to keep this essay about automation and jobs, or do you want to rewrite it to answer the climate-change prompt? (One short line.)
2) For today, is your main target: revising the thesis only, or thesis plus fixing grammar/word choice after? (One short line.)

Now, please either paste your current thesis or confirm I can use this line from your draft:
"In my opinion this technological shift undermine global employment prospects in the long term."

Feedback on that thesis (clear, specific, brief)
- Remove hedging: drop “In my opinion.” A thesis should state your position confidently.
- Grammar: “undermine” needs subject–verb agreement with singular subject → “undermines.”
- Precision & scope: “global employment prospects” is okay but a bit vague. Consider “employment opportunities” or “job security” and whether you mean all jobs or certain sectors.
- Preview: A strong thesis previews the main reasons you will explain. Right now there is no preview—readers don’t know what your paragraphs will argue.
- Time phrase: “in the long term” is fine but decide whether you want it at the start or end for emphasis.

How to revise (a short template and phrase options — try to write the sentence yourself)
- Template to follow: [Clear position] + because + (main reason 1), (main reason 2), and (main reason 3).
- Example parts you can mix:
  - Strong position starters: “Automation threatens…”, “Automation will reduce…”, “Automation is likely to harm…”
  - Objects/precision: “employment opportunities,” “job security,” “labour demand in some sectors,” “long-term employment prospects worldwide”
  - Reason phrases (use 2–3): “by automating routine tasks,” “by changing industry structures,” “by widening skill gaps between workers”
  - Linking/time phrase: “in the long term” or “over time”

Now your turn (short task)
- Try rewriting the thesis in one sentence using the template and those phrases. I’ll give quick feedback and help you perfect it. Would you like to try now?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T15:54:07.314Z

**You:** please Revise topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-25T15:56:35.404Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I can help with the topic sentences, but first we need to follow the process: agree targets and revise the thesis (Step 1) before we change topic sentences (Step 2). A few quick questions so we focus well.

1) Quick choices (one-line answers please)
- Do you want to keep this essay about automation and jobs, or rewrite it to answer the climate-change prompt? 
- Which 1–2 targets should we focus on today? (Choose from: thesis strength, topic sentence + unity for one paragraph, grammar/word choice that affect clarity, or adding evidence to one paragraph.)

2) Short diagnostic summary (so you know what I’ll focus on)
- Main problem to fix first: the essay’s thesis is weak and ungrammatical; topic sentences don’t clearly connect to a predictable structure; many spelling/word-choice errors make meaning unclear. 
- Strength: you have a clear overall view (automation harms jobs) and attempt to organize by cause/effect/scale — that’s a good start.

3) Next step: thesis
- Please paste your current thesis, or confirm I can use this sentence from your draft:
  "In my opinion this technological shift undermine global employment prospects in the long term."
- If you want to try a revision now, use this short template: [Clear position] + because + (reason 1), (reason 2), and (reason 3). 
  Example fragments you can use: “Automation will reduce job security,” “by automating routine tasks,” “by widening skill gaps,” “over time.”
- Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? (If yes, paste your one-sentence revision.) If you’d prefer, say “Please propose a thesis” and I’ll suggest one you can edit.

4) After the thesis (Step 2)
- Pick one body paragraph to work on and paste its current topic sentence (or tell me which paragraph: e.g., the paragraph about job loss, the one about global scale, etc.). We will only revise that paragraph’s topic sentence and then its supporting sentences.

Your turn: answer the two quick choices and either paste the current thesis or say you want me to propose one. Would you like to try the thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T15:57:02.338Z

**You:** please revise one body paragraph and give me some suggestions.

*Time:* 2025-11-25T15:58:49.906Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I’m ready to help, but first we need to follow the process so our work is focused and useful.

A. Quick choices (two one-line answers please)
1) Do you want to keep this essay about automation and jobs, or shall we rewrite it to answer the climate-change prompt? 
2) Which 1–2 targets should we focus on now? Choose from: thesis strength, topic sentence + unity for one paragraph, grammar/word choice that affect clarity, or adding evidence to one paragraph.

B. Quick check on the current thesis
You gave this line in the draft: “In my opinion this technological shift undermine global employment prospects in the long term.”
Very quick feedback:
- Remove “In my opinion.” State your view confidently.
- Fix grammar: “undermine” → “undermines.”
- Make it more precise (e.g., “job security,” “employment opportunities,” “labour demand in certain sectors”).
- Add a short preview of your main reasons so readers know the essay’s structure.

If you want to try now, use this simple template: [Position] + because + (reason 1), (reason 2), and (reason 3).
Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Paste your one-sentence revision, and I’ll give quick feedback.

C. Which paragraph to revise (one-line)
When we finish the thesis (Step 1), we’ll move to Step 2 and 3. Which body paragraph do you want to revise if we proceed? (Pick one: e.g., the paragraph about job loss, the paragraph about global scale/competition, or the paragraph about industry/productivity.)

D. If you want suggestions now (without me fully rewriting)
While we wait for your choices and thesis attempt, here are short, useful prompts you can apply to revise one paragraph once we finish the thesis:
- Topic-sentence frames you can adapt (these are models — try to make your own from them):
  - “Automation is likely to reduce job opportunities in [sector/group] because [reason].”
  - “The global spread of new technologies increases competition between countries, which leads to [effect].”
  - “Although automation increases productivity, it also creates long-term challenges for workers, such as [problem].”
- Guiding questions to check each supporting sentence:
  - Does this sentence clearly support the topic sentence? If not, delete or rewrite it.
  - Do I explain why the evidence or claim matters? (Add a short explanation or example.)
  - Is there a transition word that shows the relationship to the previous sentence? (e.g., However, For example, As a result)
- Quick grammar/word-choice fixes to watch for in that paragraph:
  - Subject–verb agreement (e.g., “shift undermines,” not “undermine”).
  - Use correct articles (a, the) and plural forms (countries → different countries).
  - Correct common misspellings: technology, production, entrepreneurship, satisfaction, development.

E. Next step
Reply with your two quick choices (A1 and A2), paste your one-sentence thesis attempt (or say “Please propose a thesis”), and tell me which paragraph you want to work on. Then we’ll do Step 1 (thesis) together and move to the paragraph revision.

Would you like to try the thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T15:59:12.059Z

**You:** please Revise the rest of the essay

*Time:* 2025-11-25T16:00:24.161Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I can help, but first we need to follow the agreed process so our time is focused and effective.

Two quick choices (one-line answers please)
1) Do you want to keep this essay about automation and jobs, or shall we rewrite it to answer the climate-change prompt?  
2) Which 1–2 targets should we focus on now? Choose from: thesis strength, topic sentence + unity for one paragraph, grammar/word choice that affect clarity, or adding evidence to one paragraph.

Brief diagnostic summary (so you know what I’ll focus on)
- Main problems: the draft’s thesis is weak and ungrammatical; paragraphs lack clear topic sentences that connect to a preview; many spelling/word-choice and grammar errors make meaning unclear.  
- Strengths: you have a clear overall view (automation will harm jobs) and you try to organize by cause/effect/scale — that’s a good start.

Step 1 (thesis): quick feedback on your current thesis
You used: “In my opinion this technological shift undermine global employment prospects in the long term.”
Short feedback:
- Remove “In my opinion.” State your view confidently.  
- Fix grammar: “undermine” → “undermines.”  
- Be more precise (job security, employment opportunities, labour demand).  
- Add a short preview of the main reasons so readers know the essay’s structure.

A short template to use (try this first):
[Position] + because + (reason 1), (reason 2), and (reason 3) — optional time phrase “in the long term.”

Try now: please rewrite the thesis in one sentence using that template and paste it here. I’ll give quick feedback and we’ll finalize it before moving on.

If you prefer, say “Please propose a thesis” and I’ll give one you can edit.

Step 2 (choose a paragraph)
After the thesis is done, pick one body paragraph to revise. Which one do you want to work on?
- the paragraph about job loss/industry change (first body paragraph), or
- the paragraph about global scale/competition (third paragraph), or
- another one (name it).

Remember: we will only revise the topic sentence and then the rest of that chosen paragraph (Step 3). I will guide and prompt you; please try revisions yourself and I’ll give focused feedback.

Your turn
Reply with your two quick choices (topic decision + targets), paste your one-sentence thesis attempt (or say “Please propose a thesis”), and tell me which paragraph you want to revise first. Would you like to try the thesis now?
