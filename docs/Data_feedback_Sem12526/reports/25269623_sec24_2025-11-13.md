            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for your continued effort. To help move forward, please try to revise your thesis statement by clearly stating your position without phrases like "I partly agree" or "I also think." Make sure to directly mention the two main points your essay will cover — how citizens influence government policy and the role of individual lifestyle choices.  

For example (just as inspiration), a revised thesis might look like this:  
"Individuals play an important role in addressing climate change by influencing government policies and making environmentally friendly lifestyle choices, even though government and corporate actions have the greatest impact."

Please write your own version now based on this guidance, and I will help you refine it!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 – The essay shows reasonable awareness of the essay question, addresses both the impact of individuals and governments, and provides some relevant examples. 
- Organization: 19/25 – The essay has a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, and each paragraph has a topic, but some transitions are weak and there is some repetition in ideas.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 – Vocabulary is generally adequate but often quite simple, with some word choice errors (“so nothing happen,” “so is not always working well”).
- Grammar: 17/25 – There are frequent small errors in verb forms, agreement, and awkward phrasing, but most sentences are understandable.
- **Original Essay Total: 74/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 – No significant improvements in content; the main ideas and examples remain the same.
- Organization: 19/25 – Organization is unchanged; paragraph structure and flow have not been improved.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 – Vocabulary choice remains essentially the same, with minor rewordings but persistent simplicity.
- Grammar: 17/25 – Few, if any, corrections; grammatical mistakes are still present.
- **Revised Essay Total: 74/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Some attempt to restate or split the thesis statement in the introduction.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The thesis statement was not clearly or successfully revised to provide clarity or improve tone.
  - No topic sentence was revised.
  - No body paragraph was revised or improved for clarity, support, or fluency.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 5**
- **Conversation Quality:** The student engaged in a brief exchange about the thesis statement but did not proceed to further revision tasks. The student twice repeated the same thesis statement without meaningful revision and did not interact with suggestions for topic sentences or paragraphs.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 – The chat remained shallow, focusing only on the thesis statement, with little exploratory questioning or deep engagement.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 – The student repeated their original thesis without examining or discussing the rationale for any AI feedback and made no attempt to justify, accept, or reject suggestions.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 – No meaningful revision cycles are visible; the student submitted the same thesis and made no iterative changes.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 4/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student was able to locate and identify the thesis statement as requested.
- The chat was polite and responsive within a limited scope.
- The student did submit both an original and a revised draft per instructions.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- The student must attempt and complete all required revision tasks (thesis, topic sentence, and one body paragraph).
- Deeper engagement with AI feedback is needed, including critical evaluation and justifying changes or choices.
- More evidence of an iterative, step-by-step revision process is expected; currently, progress is stalled at the thesis stage.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement – The student understood the context but did not expand on their goals or clarify needs.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement – No evidence of planning revision steps beyond identifying the thesis.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement – Did not respond to, analyze, or adopt AI suggestions.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement – No attempt was made to revise beyond reiterating the original thesis statement.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing Skills:** Revise the thesis statement for clarity and directness. Attempt and complete revision of both a topic sentence and a body paragraph to develop deeper editing skills.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills:** Actively discuss and reflect on AI feedback, explaining your reasoning for accepting or rejecting suggestions. Use the model sentences as inspiration and ask questions if uncertain.
3. **Overall Improvement:** Follow all step instructions in training mode. Engage in stepwise revision with the AI to maximize learning opportunities, and ensure that each required element is revised and improved.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
This training attempt is incomplete. The student did not revise the thesis as instructed, nor did they attempt any revision of a topic sentence or body paragraph. Recommend targeted support in scaffolding the revision process and encouraging active, two-way engagement with AI feedback. This cycle should be repeated until all revision tasks are completed.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. Actions of citizen can influence the government and big companies.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-13T03:21:11.393Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T03:23:58.688Z

**Assistant:** Great, thank you for sharing both your original and final drafts, as well as your current thesis statement:

> "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

**Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision**

Let’s start with your thesis statement. I’d like to offer some feedback:

**Strengths:**
- Your thesis does answer the question by discussing both sides (“actions of individuals vs. governments and big companies”).
- You show balance by partly agreeing and mentioning the role of citizens and their individual choices.
  
**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Try to make your thesis statement clearer and more direct, so that it doesn’t rely on phrases like “I partly agree” or “I also think.”
- Preview the main points or structure more directly to guide your reader (“citizen influence on government” and “personal lifestyle choices”).
- Aim for more confident language.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can you clarify **why** citizens’ influence matters and **how** individual actions play a supporting role?
- Can you make your thesis more concise and direct, removing phrases like “I think/I partly agree”?

**Would you like to try revising your thesis statement based on these comments?**  
Remember: Your revised thesis should clearly express your position and forecast your main points! If you’d like a model or guidance, I can provide further prompts—but please try first.

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T03:24:37.332Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! Thank you for restating your current thesis statement. Let’s break it down based on the feedback:

- Try to remove phrases like "I partly agree" or "I also think."
- Aim for a more confident tone that previews your reasons/structure.
- Make sure your thesis answers **why** each aspect matters.

**Let’s focus your thesis to directly state your position and the two main points:**
- The power of citizens to influence government decisions
- The supporting role of individual green choices

**Prompt:**  
How about starting with a statement such as:  
"Although government and corporate actions have the greatest impact on climate change, individuals play a vital role by both influencing government policy and adopting environmentally friendly habits."  
**(Don't use this exact sentence—use it as inspiration to craft your own!)**

**Here are some questions to think about as you write:**
- Can you use confident language like “Individuals play a crucial role in climate action by…”?
- How can you directly mention the two key ways individuals contribute?
