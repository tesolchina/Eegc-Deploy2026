As a university student, I agree with that internet has positive impact on our lives. During the Covid-19, schools were using Zoom to maintain their teaching. Until now, students had discovered many side of Zoom. They use Zoom to take tutorial classes, have meeting with group mates and so on. Internet not only allows students to study at home, but also provides a new learning style. Apart from that, the internet also contributes to our health. With the rapid development of 5G technology, doctors are able to operate more precisely with Robot-Assist surgery (RAs). This means we can have less trauma, shorter recovery time, and better surgery outcomes. And it’s all thanks to high-speed and stable internet. Some people may worry about their privacy issues while using the internet. However, in my opinion, as long as we pay attention to our behaviour—such as avoiding strange websites, not giving out personal information, and so on—we can protect our privacy to a certain extent.

### 🤖 **Assistant** (18:34:10)

Hello! I'm here to help you improve your essay through AI collaboration. Let's start by choosing which aspect of your essay you'd like to work on. Would you like to focus on:
1) Content & Ideas
2) Organisation & Structure
3) Vocabulary
4) Grammar & Sentence Structure

### 👤 **You** (18:34:29)

### 🤖 **Assistant** (18:34:37)

Thank you for sharing both your original and final draft. It looks like the two are identical, so we have a solid starting point to discuss ways to improve your essay. Let's work together to make your essay stronger by focusing on the four key areas from your rubric: **Content and Ideas, Organisation and Logical Progression, Vocabulary,** and **Grammar and Sentence Structure.**

---

## 1. **Content and Ideas**
Let’s start by examining your arguments and evidence:

- **a) Relevance and Depth:** You mention that the internet has a positive impact on students, specifically through Zoom, and also discuss the impact of 5G technology in healthcare.
    - Can you elaborate on *why* these examples matter to you as a university student?
    - Can you add more examples of how the internet benefits students outside of Zoom? Are there platforms or resources (e.g., online libraries, forums, collaborative tools) you personally use?
    - For your health example, would adding a brief mention of telemedicine or online health resources make your point more relatable to readers?

- **b) Counterargument:** You address privacy concerns, which is excellent. Can you develop this section further by acknowledging possible drawbacks or suggesting additional ways students can protect themselves online? This would show a balanced, thoughtful approach.

**Question:** Which of these areas do you feel is most important to expand on? Why?

---

## 2. **Organisation and Logical Progression**
Let’s look at your structure:

- Your essay moves from education, to health, to privacy. Is this the order you feel is most logical? Would grouping related points (e.g., all benefits first, then drawbacks and solutions) make your argument more persuasive?
- You start each paragraph with examples, but your conclusion is only about privacy. Would a final concluding sentence summarising your viewpoint strengthen your essay?

**Suggestion:** Try drafting an outline:
1. Introduction: State your position clearly.
2. Body Paragraph 1: Education benefits.
3. Body Paragraph 2: Health benefits.
4. Body Paragraph 3: Address privacy concerns, provide solutions.
5. Conclusion: Reaffirm positive impact, acknowledge ongoing challenges.

**Question:** Does this structure work for your ideas, or do you have another organisation in mind?

---

## 3. **Vocabulary**
Your vocabulary is clear, but can be more varied and precise:

- For example, instead of “positive impact,” you could use “transformative influence” or “significant benefits.”
- Instead of “had discovered many side of Zoom,” perhaps “have explored various functionalities of Zoom.”

**Exercise:** Choose two sentences and rewrite them using more sophisticated vocabulary. Would these changes help better convey your ideas?

---

## 4. **Grammar and Sentence Structure**
A few grammatical issues stand out:

- “I agree with that internet has positive impact…” should be “I agree that the internet has a positive impact…”
- “During the Covid-19, schools were using Zoom…” could be “…During the Covid-19 pandemic, schools used Zoom…”
- “Students had discovered many side of Zoom.” → “Students have discovered many aspects of Zoom.”
- “Have meeting with group mates…” → “hold meetings with group mates…”

Would you like to revise these sentences now, or would you prefer to tackle the organisation first?

---

### **Let’s Begin Revising**

**Reflection:** Which area do you feel would make the biggest difference if you improved it—content depth, organisation, vocabulary, or grammar?  
**Next Steps:** Should we focus on adding more examples, improving structure, elevating vocabulary, or correcting grammar first?

Your turn:  
- Share your thoughts, and let’s work together step-by-step! If you’d like, you can revise a paragraph and explain your choices based on our discussion.
