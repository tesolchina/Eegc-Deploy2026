# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The original presents a relevant position (government intervention to protect migrant workers) but ideas are underdeveloped and repetitive. Example: “It is necessary that the government implement stricter laws to protect migrant workers right to improve equality and social productivity.” lacks precision and detailed support.
- Organization: 18/25 - Clear overall structure (intro, body, conclusion) but paragraphs repeat ideas and lack tight logical progression (e.g., both body paragraphs restate similar points without clear evidence or distinct subclaims).
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Limited and sometimes inaccurate word choices (e.g., “unfair treated,” “the effective and efficient of productivity”). Tone is not yet consistently academic.
- Grammar: 15/25 - Frequent grammar and phrasing errors that reduce clarity (articles, verb forms, subject-verb agreement, word order).
- **Original Essay Total: 66/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - Thesis now clearly states the claim and previews reasons: “Governments should enforce stricter labour laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by ensuring fair treatment and guaranteeing equal pay, thereby promoting workplace equality and boosting national productivity.” The first body paragraph now gives clearer causal claims and an example (equal pay).
- Organization: 21/25 - Improved logical link between thesis, topic sentence, and supporting sentences in the first paragraph. However, the second paragraph remains unrevised and repeats claims, limiting overall cohesion.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Noticeable improvement (uses “enforce,” “guaranteeing equal pay,” “workplace equality,” and British “labour”), though some awkward phrasing remains in the unrevised second paragraph.
- Grammar: 20/25 - First paragraph and thesis show corrected grammar (e.g., “ensure that employers treat…”). Several errors persist in the second paragraph (e.g., “the effective and efficient of productivity have gone up significantly,” “migrant workers being unfair treated”).
- **Revised Essay Total: 82/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +16 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clearer, more academic thesis that previews reasons: “Governments should enforce stricter labour laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by ensuring fair treatment and guaranteeing equal pay...” (student revised from an indirect/grammatically weak original).
  - Stronger topic sentence for first paragraph: “By requiring equal pay and written employment contracts, stricter labour laws can ensure that employers treat migrant workers fairly, promoting workplace equality.”
  - Rewritten first body paragraph with concrete enforcement consequences and a concise example: the paragraph now includes the enforcement idea and consequences: “Failure to comply can lead to fines, lawsuits, and reputational damage, and in extreme cases, may force a firm to close,” and example “governments can require equal pay for equal work.”
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Second body paragraph and conclusion were not revised; they still contain grammar and clarity issues (e.g., “the effective and efficient of productivity have gone up significantly”).
  - Lack of concrete evidence or citations (no statistics, case studies, or named laws) to strengthen claims about productivity and employer behavior.
  - Some repetitive sentences remain in the first paragraph (a few sentences restate similar ideas and could be tightened).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 19**
- **Conversation Quality:** Iterative, structured, and goal-oriented. The assistant provided a diagnostic, proposed a stepwise revision plan, and guided the student through thesis revision, topic-sentence refinement, and paragraph rewriting. The student actively revised sentences and accepted or adapted suggestions (e.g., preferred British spelling), producing multiple drafts.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - Evidence: 19 back-and-forth turns with multi-step guidance (initial diagnostic, stepwise plan, framing sentences, line-by-line suggestions). The assistant guided the student through Step 1 (thesis), Step 2 (topic sentence), and Step 3 (paragraph revision).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - Evidence: The student engaged with suggestions and produced independent revisions (e.g., wrote their own thesis using the provided frames and revised the paragraph). The student exercised minor critical choices (requested “labour” spelling, adjusted wording). There is limited explicit rejection or in-depth critique of AI suggestions—mostly acceptance and adaptation rather than formal critique.
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - Evidence: Multiple meaningful revision cycles: student provided an initial thesis, revised it to “Governments should enforce stricter labour laws…,” then revised the topic sentence (“By requiring equal pay and written employment contracts…”), then rewrote the paragraph and accepted final refinements. The assistant provided sentence-level fixes and the student iterated accordingly.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear improvement in thesis clarity and structure: student produced a concise, previewing thesis (“Governments should enforce stricter labour laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by ensuring fair treatment and guaranteeing equal pay…”).
- Effective collaboration and iterative revision: student responded to frames and line-level guidance, producing stronger sentences and a coherent first paragraph.
- Good adoption of academic phrasing and correct British spelling where requested; improved use of cause-effect language (e.g., enforcement → fines → reputational harm).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Revise the second body paragraph and conclusion for grammar, clarity, and to avoid repetition. Specific guidance: replace “the effective and efficient of productivity have gone up significantly” with a clearer phrasing (e.g., “overall productivity can rise when migrant workers are treated fairly because...”), and fix subject-verb/wording errors.
- Add concrete evidence/examples (statistics, named laws, or brief real-world examples) to strengthen claims about productivity and employer compliance.
- Perform a final copy-edit pass for remaining grammatical issues and concision, especially in the unrevised sections.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - Student provided the original draft and clear revision goals (improve clarity, argument strength, structure, grammar, vocabulary, evidence). Evidence: student explicitly selected targets in chat and pasted text.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - Student followed a structured revision plan recommended by the assistant (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), demonstrating strategic revision sequencing.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good (Developing toward Excellent) - The student adopted many suggestions and occasionally adjusted wording (e.g., “labour” preference), but provided limited explicit critique of alternative AI suggestions.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - Student actively rewrote sentences and paragraphs, showing capacity to implement feedback (multiple revised drafts were produced by the student).

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise the second body paragraph and conclusion with the same stepwise approach used for the first paragraph: produce a clearer topic sentence, concrete example/evidence, and a concise concluding link to the thesis.
2. Incorporate at least one concrete piece of evidence (a statistic, law name, or brief case example) to support the productivity claim and strengthen persuasiveness.
3. Do a final copy-edit focusing on grammar and concision across the entire essay (fix subject-verb agreement, article usage, and awkward phrases such as “migrant workers being unfair treated” → “migrant workers being unfairly treated”).

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student demonstrated strong willingness to engage in an iterative revision process and followed the assistant’s plan closely. They completed all three module tasks (thesis, topic sentence, body paragraph) and produced measurable improvement (+16 points).
- The unrevised second paragraph limits the essay’s overall score; encouraging the student to apply the same revision steps to that paragraph would likely raise the essay into the mid-to-high 80s.
- The student would benefit from explicit instruction or examples on integrating brief evidence or citations to substantiate claims about productivity and enforcement outcomes.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Nowadays, the problem of migrant workers being unfair treated is becoming worse. It is necessary that the government implement stricter laws to protect migrant workers right to improve equality and social productivity.
Firstly, the implementation of laws can encourage companies and employers to treat migrant workers equally. The company must following the laws setting by the government in order to improve its ethical reputation. If not, the company may cause some problems and negative impacts that can lead to shut down the firm. Therefore, laws can effectively protect migrant workers’ right in the workplace. For example, government can set a law that migrant workers must be paid the same wages as other workers who work in the same position. It is powerful to avoid a very common issue that migrant workers being paid less even if they work longer hours per day than native workers. It is believed that laws can tackle the problem of unfair treatment and improve equality in workplace.
Secondly, laws can increase whole society’s productivity. Due to the rising number of migrant workers in different countries, the effective and efficient of productivity have gone up significantly. However, migrant workers being unfair treated can cause lots of negative impacts. For instance, because of the exploitation of their rights, their willingness and satisfaction on working will decrease and they will choose to leave. It is important that the government should set stricter laws to protect them. The laws can help provide them a steady work environment.
In conclusion, the government can set up stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights.


Revised:
Nowadays, the problem of migrant workers being unfair treated is becoming worse. Governments should enforce stricter labour laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by ensuring fair treatment and guaranteeing equal pay, thereby promoting workplace equality and boosting national productivity.

Firstly, by requiring equal pay and written employment contracts, stricter labour laws can ensure that employers treat migrant workers fairly, promoting workplace equality. Companies are required to follow laws set by the government to protect workers and maintain their reputation. Failure to comply can lead to fines, lawsuits, and reputational damage, and in extreme cases, may force a firm to close. Therefore, such laws can protect migrant workers’ rights in the workplace. For example, governments can require equal pay for equal work. This would prevent common abuses, such as paying migrant workers less or forcing them to work longer hours than local workers. Stronger enforcement would reduce unfair treatment and promote workplace equality.

Secondly, laws can increase whole society’s productivity. Due to the rising number of migrant workers in different countries, the effective and efficient of productivity have gone up significantly. However, migrant workers being unfair treated can cause lots of negative impacts. For instance, because of the exploitation of their rights, their willingness and satisfaction on working will decrease and they will choose to leave. It is important that the government should set stricter laws to protect them. The laws can help provide them a steady work environment.

In conclusion, the government can set up stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-24T14:19:55.056Z

**You:** Thesis statement: It is necessary that the government implement stricter laws to protect migrant workers right to improve equality and social productivity.

*Time:* 2025-11-24T14:23:49.622Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s begin. First, tell me briefly: what are your personal goals for this session? For example, do you most want to improve clarity, argument strength, structure/organization, grammar, vocabulary, or use of evidence? Or a combination?

Below I’ll offer a short diagnostic of your essay (using the rubric categories) so you can choose which issues to focus on.

Diagnostic feedback (brief)
- Content & Ideas: Developing (3). Your main idea — that governments should pass stricter laws to protect migrant workers — is relevant and reasonable, but the thesis is unclear and a bit grammatically weak. Arguments are stated but not developed deeply; evidence is general and needs more specific examples or explanation.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Basic-to-Developing (2–3). The essay has a clear overall structure (intro, two body paragraphs, conclusion), but paragraph development is repetitive and some sentences don’t flow logically. Topic sentences need clearer links to the thesis.
- Vocabulary: Basic (2–3). Words are often repeated and some word choices are inaccurate (e.g., “unfair treated,” “the effective and efficient of productivity”). You can improve precision and formality for academic tone.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Basic (2). There are several grammatical errors (subject-verb agreement, missing articles, word forms) and awkward sentences. Sentence variety is limited.

Suggested targets (pick 1–3)
- Strengthen and clarify the thesis (make it answer the question, preview main points, use confident language).
- Improve a topic sentence so it clearly links to the new thesis.
- Revise one body paragraph for clarity, unity, and better evidence.
- Fix key grammar errors (articles, verb forms) that affect clarity.
- Improve vocabulary/word choice for formality and precision.

Which of these would you like to focus on in today’s revision? (Pick up to three — I recommend thesis first plus one paragraph.) Also tell me which body paragraph you want to work on: the first paragraph about equal pay/ethical reputation, or the second about productivity and retention?

Once you confirm your targets and the paragraph, we’ll move to Step 1: revising your thesis.

*Time:* 2025-11-24T14:24:56.521Z

**You:** My target is to improve clarity, argument strength, structure and organization, grammar, vocabulary, or use of evidence and a combination

*Time:* 2025-11-24T14:28:13.256Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for saying you want a combination of improvements. I suggest we focus on a small, clear set of targets so we can make real progress in this session.

Recommended targets (pick up to three — I suggest the first two)
1) Strengthen and clarify the thesis so it directly answers the question and previews your main points (equality and productivity).  
2) Improve the topic sentence and supporting sentences of one body paragraph so they clearly link to that revised thesis.  
3) Fix key grammar and word-choice errors in that same paragraph (articles, verb forms, and more precise vocabulary).

Which body paragraph would you like to work on: the first (equal pay / employer reputation) or the second (productivity / retention)? Also confirm whether you want target 3 (grammar/vocabulary) included.

Once you confirm these targets and the paragraph, we’ll move to Step 1. Could you also paste the thesis sentence you want to start with (you can use the one in your draft or a new attempt)?

*Time:* 2025-11-24T14:29:38.921Z

**You:** I will choose target 1and3,the body paragraph I want to work on is the first body paragraph.
Thesis statement: It is necessary that the government implement stricter laws to protect migrant workers right to improve equality and social productivity.

*Time:* 2025-11-24T14:33:06.529Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming your targets (1 and 3) and choosing the first body paragraph. That’s a smart focus: a clearer thesis plus grammar/vocabulary fixes in one paragraph will make the whole essay stronger.

Step 1 — Thesis feedback
Your current thesis:  
"It is necessary that the government implement stricter laws to protect migrant workers right to improve equality and social productivity."

Quick, specific feedback
- Answering the question: The thesis implies a “yes” but does not state it clearly and confidently. Say directly whether governments should enforce stricter laws.
- Preview: The thesis should briefly preview the main reasons you will discuss (you said equality and social productivity — make those explicit).
- Grammar/word choice: fix possessive (“migrant workers' rights”), verb forms (“implement” vs. “implementing” depending on structure), articles, and make it more formal/concise.
- Tone: Use confident, direct language (avoid “It is necessary that…” which is indirect and wordy).

How to revise (use this frame)
Try one of these sentence frames to build your revised thesis — fill the blanks with your ideas:
- “Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by ______________ and ______________.”
- “Stricter government labor laws are necessary to protect migrant workers’ rights because they will ______________ and ______________.”

Would you like to try revising the thesis now using one of those frames? Type your new sentence and I’ll give targeted feedback and suggest small edits (we’ll keep changes small so you’re doing the writing).

*Time:* 2025-11-24T14:34:37.925Z

**You:** Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers' rights by ensuring fair treatment and securing legal wages, thereby promoting equality and boosting social productivity.

*Time:* 2025-11-24T14:42:40.751Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that thesis already answers the question and previews your main reasons (equality and productivity). Good job using confident language.

Two small suggestions to make it stronger and more precise:
- Specify the type of laws: “stricter labor laws” is clearer than just “stricter laws.”
- Use more precise verbs and nouns: “guaranteeing fair wages” and “workplace equality” sound more academic and exact than “securing legal wages” and “equality.”

If you like, you can accept minor changes or try one more revision yourself. Here is one concise model you can use or adapt:
- Governments should enforce stricter labor laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by ensuring fair treatment and guaranteeing equal pay, thereby promoting workplace equality and boosting national productivity.

Are you happy with this thesis (either your version or the model), so we can move on to Step 2? If yes, please paste the topic sentence from the first body paragraph you want to work on (or confirm the current one: “Firstly, the implementation of laws can encourage companies and employers to treat migrant workers equally.”).

*Time:* 2025-11-24T14:43:02.572Z

**You:** Topic sentence of the first body paragraph: Firstly, the implementation of laws can encourage companies and employers to treat migrant workers equally.

*Time:* 2025-11-24T14:52:36.873Z

**Assistant:** Good — thanks. Quick feedback on your current topic sentence:
- It’s relevant, but vague. “Implementation of laws” doesn’t name the laws (use “stricter labor laws”) and it doesn’t clearly connect to your thesis about equality and productivity.
- The sentence could more directly show how laws change employer behavior (e.g., by requiring equal pay or enforcing standards).
- Make the link explicit: show that this paragraph explains how laws lead to fair treatment (one of your thesis points).

Try revising now using one of these short frames (fill the blanks):
- “Stricter labor laws encourage employers to ________ (e.g., pay fair wages / follow workplace standards), which helps protect migrant workers’ rights by ________.”
- “By requiring ________, stricter labor laws can compel employers to ________, promoting workplace equality for migrant workers.”
- “When governments enforce stricter labor laws that ________, employers are more likely to ________, reducing exploitation of migrant workers.”

Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence now using one of those frames? Paste your revised sentence and I’ll give targeted feedback and a small suggestion for polishing.

*Time:* 2025-11-24T14:52:55.063Z

**You:** By requiring equal pay and legal contracts, stricter labor laws can compel employers to treat migrant workers fairly, promoting workplace equality.

*Time:* 2025-11-24T14:57:25.808Z

**Assistant:** Nice — your topic sentence is clear and directly linked to the thesis. Well done.

Quick praise and targeted feedback
- Strengths: It states the cause (requiring equal pay and contracts), the effect (compel employers to treat migrant workers fairly), and links to the thesis point (promoting workplace equality). That’s exactly what a good topic sentence should do.
- Tiny polish suggestion (optional): consider using “written employment contracts” or “enforceable contracts” instead of “legal contracts” for precision, and use “ensure” or “require” rather than “compel” if you prefer a slightly more neutral academic tone. But your sentence is already strong.

Would you like a short model you can adapt? Here’s a compact example you can use or tweak:
- By requiring equal pay and enforceable employment contracts, stricter labor laws can ensure employers treat migrant workers fairly and promote workplace equality.

Step 3 — Revising the rest of the first paragraph (guided help)
Now let’s improve the supporting sentences for clarity, unity, and grammar. Before you rewrite, here are specific problems in your original paragraph and quick suggestions you can use to revise each sentence. Try to rewrite the paragraph yourself using these suggestions; paste your version and I’ll give focused feedback and then provide the full updated essay.

Line-by-line issues and revision hints
- Original: “Firstly, the implementation of laws can encourage companies and employers to treat migrant workers equally.”
  - Revise: Start by repeating key terms from the topic sentence: “Stricter labor laws…” or “By requiring equal pay and contracts, stricter labor laws…”
- Original: “The company must following the laws setting by the government in order to improve its ethical reputation.”
  - Problems: verb form, plural/company reference, “laws setting”
  - Fix idea: “Companies must follow laws set by the government to protect workers and maintain their reputation.”
- Original: “If not, the company may cause some problems and negative impacts that can lead to shut down the firm.”
  - Problems: awkward phrasing, unclear consequences
  - Fix idea: “Failure to comply can lead to fines, lawsuits, and reputational damage—and in extreme cases may force a firm to close.”
- Original: “Therefore, laws can effectively protect migrant workers’ right in the workplace.”
  - Problems: singular/plural, article
  - Fix idea: “Therefore, such laws can protect migrant workers’ rights in the workplace.”
- Original: “For example, government can set a law that migrant workers must be paid the same wages as other workers who work in the same position.”
  - Problems: awkward wording, repetition
  - Fix idea: “For example, governments can require equal pay for equal work.”
  - Tip: If possible, add a concrete detail or short evidence (e.g., a statistic, a well-known example, or a hypothetical short scenario) to make the example stronger.
- Original: “It is powerful to avoid a very common issue that migrant workers being paid less even if they work longer hours per day than native workers.”
  - Problems: grammar and word order
  - Fix idea: “This would prevent common abuses—such as paying migrant workers less or forcing them to work longer hours than native employees.”
- Original: “It is believed that laws can tackle the problem of unfair treatment and improve equality in workplace.”
  - Problems: vague phrase “It is believed,” article use
  - Fix idea: “Stronger enforcement would reduce exploitation and improve workplace equality.”

Mini-plan to rewrite the paragraph (3–4 sentences)
1. Begin with your topic sentence (you already did that).
2. Explain how laws make employers change behaviour (compliance, inspections, fines, contracts).
3. Give a clear example (equal pay law) and briefly explain its effect.
4. Conclude the paragraph by linking back to the thesis (this improves equality and supports productivity later).

Prompt: Would you like to try rewriting this paragraph now using those hints? Paste your revised paragraph and I’ll give focused corrections for grammar, vocabulary, and coherence. After you confirm the paragraph revision, I’ll produce the full updated essay text (including your revised thesis and paragraph), as requested.

*Time:* 2025-11-24T14:58:12.698Z

**You:** Rewrite: Firstly, by requiring equal pay and written employment contracts, stricter labour laws can ensure employers to treat migrant workers fairly, promoting workplace equality. Companies must follow laws set by the government to protect workers and maintain their reputation. Failure to comply can lead to fines, lawsuits, and reputational damage, and extreme cases may force a firm to close. Therefore, such laws can protect migrant workers’ rights in the workplace.

It is believed that laws can tackle the problem of unfair treatment and improve equality in workplace.

*Time:* 2025-11-24T15:13:26.663Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — you’ve improved clarity and added useful detail. I’ll give focused, sentence-level feedback and short phrase suggestions so you can try another revision. Then, when you’re happy with the paragraph, I’ll produce the full updated essay including your revised thesis and paragraph.

Quick overall notes
- Good: Clear topic, concrete actions (equal pay, contracts), and consequences for noncompliance.  
- To improve: fix some grammar (verbs, articles), remove small repetitions, and tighten the concluding sentence so it links smoothly back to your thesis.

Sentence-by-sentence corrections and short suggestions
1) “Firstly, by requiring equal pay and written employment contracts, stricter labour laws can ensure employers to treat migrant workers fairly, promoting workplace equality.”
- Problem: “ensure employers to treat” is ungrammatical.
- Short fixes (pick one): “ensure that employers treat migrant workers fairly” OR “ensure employers treat migrant workers fairly.”
- Also: choose spelling consistency — “labour” (British) or “labor” (American). Which do you prefer?

2) “Companies must follow laws set by the government to protect workers and maintain their reputation.”
- This is OK. If you want a slightly more formal phrasing: “Companies are required to follow laws set by the government to protect workers and maintain their reputations.”

3) “Failure to comply can lead to fines, lawsuits, and reputational damage, and extreme cases may force a firm to close.”
- Small grammar/punctuation: add commas and consider “may even force a firm to close.”
- Suggested: “Failure to comply can lead to fines, lawsuits, and reputational damage, and, in extreme cases, may even force a firm to close.”

4) “Therefore, such laws can protect migrant workers’ rights in the workplace.”
- Clear but a little repetitive (you already state protection in the topic sentence). Consider moving this to a concluding link sentence or shortening it: “Overall, these measures protect migrant workers’ rights.”

5) “For example, government can set a law that migrant workers must be paid the same wages as other workers who work in the same position.”
- Problems: missing article (“the government” or “governments”), wordy/repetitive.
- Short, stronger phrasing: “For example, the government can require equal pay for equal work.” OR “For example, governments can require migrant workers to receive the same wages as other workers in the same role.”

6) “This would prevent common abuses, such as paying migrant workers less or forcing them to work longer hours than native employees.”
- Good. Consider using “local workers” or “domestic workers” instead of “native employees” (safer word choice).
- Minor tweak: “This would prevent common abuses such as paying migrant workers less or forcing them to work longer hours than local workers.”

7) “It is believed that laws can tackle the problem of unfair treatment and improve equality in workplace.”
- Problem: “It is believed” is vague and passive; missing article “the workplace.”
- Stronger alternatives: “Such laws would reduce exploitation and improve workplace equality.” OR “Stronger enforcement would reduce unfair treatment and promote workplace equality.”

Short structural suggestion
- Order: topic sentence → explanation of how laws change employer behaviour → concrete example (equal pay) → consequences for noncompliance → concluding link to thesis. Aim for 4–6 sentences total and avoid repeating the same idea.

Now your next step
Please try rewriting the paragraph again, using the suggested short fixes above (you can copy any of the short suggested phrases). Paste the revised paragraph here — I’ll give a final, focused check and then produce the full revised essay text once you confirm the paragraph is ready.

Also tell me: would you like me to use British (“labour”) or American (“labor”) spelling in the final essay?

**You:** I prefer “labour”,rewrite: Firstly, by requiring equal pay and written employment contracts, stricter labour laws can ensure that employers treat migrant workers fairly, promoting workplace equality. Companies are required to follow laws set by the government to protect workers and maintain their reputation. Failure to comply can lead to fines, lawsuits, and reputational damage, and in extreme cases, may force a firm to close. Therefore, such laws can protect migrant workers’ rights in the workplace. For example, the government can set a law that migrant workers must be paid the same wages as other workers who work in the same position. This would prevent common abuses, such as paying migrant workers less or forcing them to work longer hours than local workers. Stronger enforcement would reduce unfair treatment and promote workplace equality.

**Assistant:** Nice work — this paragraph is much clearer, directly linked to your thesis, and uses the British spelling you wanted. A couple of very small polish points I made in the version below:
- I changed “the government can set a law that migrant workers must be paid the same wages as other workers who work in the same position” to the shorter “governments can require equal pay for equal work” for clarity and concision, and to match the plural “Governments” in your thesis.
- I kept the rest of your wording and tone (and did not edit the second body paragraph or conclusion, since we agreed to focus only on the thesis and the first body paragraph).

Here is the full essay with your revised thesis and the rewritten first body paragraph (British spelling: “labour”):

Nowadays, the problem of migrant workers being unfair treated is becoming worse. Governments should enforce stricter labour laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by ensuring fair treatment and guaranteeing equal pay, thereby promoting workplace equality and boosting national productivity.

Firstly, by requiring equal pay and written employment contracts, stricter labour laws can ensure that employers treat migrant workers fairly, promoting workplace equality. Companies are required to follow laws set by the government to protect workers and maintain their reputation. Failure to comply can lead to fines, lawsuits, and reputational damage, and in extreme cases, may force a firm to close. Therefore, such laws can protect migrant workers’ rights in the workplace. For example, governments can require equal pay for equal work. This would prevent common abuses, such as paying migrant workers less or forcing them to work longer hours than local workers. Stronger enforcement would reduce unfair treatment and promote workplace equality.

Secondly, laws can increase whole society’s productivity. Due to the rising number of migrant workers in different countries, the effective and efficient of productivity have gone up significantly. However, migrant workers being unfair treated can cause lots of negative impacts. For instance, because of the exploitation of their rights, their willingness and satisfaction on working will decrease and they will choose to leave. It is important that the government should set stricter laws to protect them. The laws can help provide them a steady work environment.
In conclusion, the government can set up stricter laws to protect migrant workers’ rights.

Would you like me to: 
- copy-edit the rest of the essay next (grammar, vocabulary, flow), or 
- focus on improving the second body paragraph’s topic sentence and content in the same way we did the first?

Either choice is fine — tell me which and we’ll continue.

**Assistant:** Great — here is your final draft with the revised thesis and the rewritten first body paragraph we worked on (British spelling: “labour”). I kept the rest of your essay as it was, since we agreed to focus on the thesis and the first paragraph.

Well done — you made clear, effective changes to the thesis and the first paragraph. If you want to continue, I can now:
- copy-edit the rest of the essay for grammar and vocabulary (recommended), or
- revise the second body paragraph in the same way we revised the first.

Which would you like next?
