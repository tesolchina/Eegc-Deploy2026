# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - Student presents a clear position (automation harms employment) and plausible reasons (routine jobs replaced; skilled jobs affected; some new tech jobs). However ideas are often vague and underdeveloped (e.g., “Not to mention the inserinces of human labours.”) with little concrete evidence or examples.
- Organization: 17/25 - There is basic paragraphing and an attempted counterpoint paragraph, but topic sentences and transitions are weak and the logical progression is sometimes unclear.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Frequent spelling and word-choice errors (e.g., “oppertunity,” “muti tasking,” “finace”) reduce precision and readability.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Many grammatical errors and sentence fragments (e.g., “Since machines and it‘s software could be muti tasking 24 hours non stop.”) frequently impede clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 63/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
(Note: assessment based on the revision work reflected in the chat — thesis revised and paragraph 1 substantially improved; paragraphs 2–3 remain largely unchanged and still contain many errors.)
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - Thesis is now clear and previews main points: “Automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because it will replace many routine production jobs, encroach on skilled professions through adaptable software, and create only a limited number of technical roles…” Paragraph 1 is more coherent and ties directly to the thesis. Overall argument still needs more concrete evidence and examples.
- Organization: 20/25 - Thesis now previews the essay; paragraph 1 shows a clear cause–effect chain (machines operate continuously → fewer workers → employer preference). Paragraphs 2 and 3, however, remain poorly organized and would benefit from clearer topic sentences and transitions.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Improved phrasing in the revised paragraph 1 (e.g., “operate continuously and perform multiple tasks”), but many spelling and lexical errors remain in later paragraphs (e.g., “poplukation,” “automachies,” “loweerempolyment”).
- Grammar: 18/25 - Paragraph 1 sentences were polished and fragments fixed (for example, the assistant combined causal clauses into full sentences). However, paragraphs 2 and 3 still have frequent grammar and agreement mistakes that reduce clarity.
- **Revised Essay Total: 78/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +15 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis: Revised to a clear, confident thesis that previews the three main reasons and aligns with the essay’s claims (“Automation will undermine global employment prospects…”).
  - Topic sentence: Paragraph 1 topic sentence rewritten to be specific and linked to thesis: “Automation reduces the need for human labor in routine production because machines can operate continuously and perform multiple tasks.”
  - Paragraph 1 development: Supporting sentences were restructured into a clear cause–effect chain and fragments were corrected, improving clarity and coherence.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Paragraphs 2 and 3 still contain many spelling, grammar, and organization problems and need revision to match the improved clarity of paragraph 1.
  - Lack of concrete evidence or examples (statistics, industry examples, or citations) to support broad claims about professional job displacement.
  - Tone and lexical precision could be improved (replace informal phrasing and vague intensifiers with specific, academic wording).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 29** (29 chat messages between student and AI assistant)
- **Conversation Quality:** Highly structured, goal-oriented session. The assistant set a 3-step revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), the student followed Plan B, and the interaction included multiple revision cycles and targeted feedback. The student both accepted AI suggestions and produced their own rewrites for the AI to critique.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - The chat is long and iterative (29 messages), with clear multi-step planning and sustained back-and-forth on thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph revision. The assistant provided scaffolding and the student engaged consistently.
  - Evidence: The assistant outlined the three-step process and the student proceeded through those steps (e.g., “B” to accept the assistant’s thesis suggestion, then chose paragraph 1).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - The student evaluated suggestions to a good degree: they tried their own rewrite of the topic sentence, asked for focused help (option C), and accepted some AI revisions (e.g., accepted the provided thesis: “Accept this thesis as-is”). However, explicit, detailed justifications for accepting or rejecting specific AI suggestions were limited.
  - Evidence: Student wrote their own topic-sentence attempt (“Because machines and their software can operate continuously and multitask around the clock”), then accepted the assistant’s polished paragraph 1.
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - Strong iterative process: multiple cycles of proposed edits, student rewrites, assistant feedback, and acceptance. The student practiced revision steps (attempted rewrite, requested targeted fixes, accepted final paragraph 1).
  - Evidence: Sequence includes: assistant suggests thesis → student accepts → student rewrites topic sentence → assistant polishes → student accepts paragraph 1 changes.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Active engagement and follow-through: the student followed the assistant’s structured plan and moved through thesis → topic sentence → paragraph revisions.
  - Evidence: Student selected Plan B, accepted the assistant’s thesis, attempted their own topic-sentence rewrite, and accepted the final paragraph 1 (“Accept this version of paragraph 1…”).
- Good ability to apply feedback: after targeted guidance, the student produced a clearer topic sentence and collaborated to improve paragraph 1.
  - Evidence: Student’s revision “Because machines and their software can operate continuously and multitask around the clock” and the assistant’s polishing led to a coherent paragraph 1.
- Effective use of AI as a coach: the student asked for targeted fixes (option C) and used the assistant’s scaffolding to focus edits rather than asking for wholesale rewriting.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Surface mechanics (spelling, punctuation, grammar): Many remaining errors in paragraphs 2 and 3 reduce credibility and readability.
  - Recommendation: systematic proofreading pass (spell-check + targeted grammar fixes) and focused practice on common error patterns (articles, pluralization, verb forms).
- Development and evidence: arguments remain general and lack concrete examples, data, or real-world illustrations.
  - Recommendation: add specific examples (e.g., manufacturing automation statistics, examples of professions affected, or citations) to strengthen claims.
- Organization after paragraph 1: paragraphs 2 and 3 need clearer topic sentences and tighter development to mirror the improved structure in paragraph 1.
  - Recommendation: apply the same three-step revision approach to paragraph 2 (revise topic sentence → link to thesis → add evidence).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - student accepted and followed the assistant’s process and provided paragraph choice and revision preferences. Evidence: the student selected Plan B and specified paragraph 1.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - student followed a structured plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) and stayed on task.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good - student attempted independent rewrites and requested targeted critique; could increase explicit evaluation of suggestions by stating reasons for acceptance/rejection.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - student made independent attempts at rewriting and used assistant feedback to refine writing.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Systematic proofreading and correction pass: run the text through spell-check, then address persistent grammar patterns (articles, plurals, verb forms). Ask the AI to produce a list of recurring errors from your draft and correct them systematically.
2. Strengthen evidence and examples: for each major claim, add a concrete example, statistic, or brief case (e.g., an industry where automation reduced routine jobs; example of a professional task being automated).
3. Apply the same stepwise revision process to remaining paragraphs: revise the topic sentence to match the thesis, reorganize supporting sentences into clear cause–effect or evidence chains, and then perform a final polish.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student demonstrated strong engagement with the AI coach and followed a clear revision protocol. They successfully revised the thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph 1 during the session.
- The main remaining needs are mechanical accuracy and deeper content development in paragraphs 2 and 3. Consider assigning a focused follow-up: (a) a copy-editing exercise to fix recurring errors, and (b) a content revision to add one concrete example or citation to each major claim.
- The student's interaction with AI shows good collaborative behavior and developing critical evaluation skills; continued practice will strengthen independent editing abilities.

If you would like, I can:
- Produce a line-by-line list of remaining spelling/grammar errors in the current revised draft, and
- Provide 2–3 concrete example sentences/data points the student could add to paragraphs 2 and 3 to strengthen the argument.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
I believe automation will shift ultimately undermine global employment prespects in the long term.

Firstly, automation will greatly decrease job oppertunity. Since machines and it‘s software could be muti tasking 24 hours non stop. Less workers will be needed during production tasks. So factories or workplacr would choose hiring less human labours. Also, human labours will cause more error compare with auto machines and softwares. Not to mention the inserinces of human labours. So from a long term aspect, automation will lead to a decrease in employment rate due to the higher efficency and budgget efficency brought by automation.

Secondly, automation can tackle different kind of worktasks, more superior then human. In some developed countries, they are facing aging poplukation problem, huch greatly decreases the young labour forces. Although in some undeveloped regions they will could provided large number of young labour forces, but most of them dom’t have professional knowledge skills. Like in medical, finace, nuclear energy. However, automation could handle different kinds of task load. And could be modified easily to counter another kind of taskload. Making bussiness owner more unwilling to spend large amount of money to hiner professional talents. Because in the database of automachies already have it. So automation will even overthrown the employment rate in professional job aspect and lead to loweerempolyment prospects in long term.

However, automation could bring some enhancement on employment rate in some aspects. Since this kind of automation machines need to be programmed by humans. So talents in machine programming and teachers in this aspect also required. Their employment rate will be grown as the influenice of automationin different areas. So automation would still bring some positive effects on the employment rate of programmers and their teachers.


Revised:
Automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because it will replace many routine production jobs, encroach on skilled professions through adaptable software, and create only a limited number of technical roles that cannot fully offset those losses.

Firstly, automation reduces the need for human labor in routine production because machines can operate continuously and perform multiple tasks. Because machines and their software can operate around the clock and multitask, employers need fewer workers for routine production roles. Factories and other workplaces therefore often choose to hire fewer human workers. Human workers are also more likely to make errors during repetitive tasks than automated systems, and employers may view machines as cheaper and more reliable over time. For these reasons, automation tends to lower employment rates in routine production by improving operational and budgetary efficiency.

Secondly, automation can tackle different kind of worktasks, more superior then human. In some developed countries, they are facing aging poplukation problem, huch greatly decreases the young labour forces. Although in some undeveloped regions they will could provided large number of young labour forces, but most of them dom’t have professional knowledge skills. Like in medical, finace, nuclear energy. However, automation could handle different kinds of task load. And could be modified easily to counter another kind of taskload. Making bussiness owner more unwilling to spend large amount of money to hiner professional talents. Because in the database of automachies already have it. So automation will even overthrown the employment rate in professional job aspect and lead to loweerempolyment prospects in long term.

However, automation could bring some enhancement on employment rate in some aspects. Since this kind of automation machines need to be programmed by humans. So talents in machine programming and teachers in this aspect also required. Their employment rate will be grown as the influenice of automationin different areas. So automation would still bring some positive effects on the employment rate of programmers and their teachers.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:51:07.456Z

**You:** Revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:53:12.575Z

**Assistant:** Great — before I revise anything, let’s agree on what you want to learn and which problems to fix.

1) Goals — what do you want to improve today?
- Do you want mostly: clarity of your main point (thesis), argument strength and structure, or grammar and word choice? (You can pick more than one, but tell me which is the priority.)

2) Quick diagnostic feedback (using rubric categories)
- Thesis & Argument: Strength — you have a clear position (automation harms employment). Area for improvement — the thesis is weak and contains hedging and errors; it doesn’t preview the main reasons you’ll discuss.
- Organization: Strength — you use paragraphs and attempt a counterpoint paragraph. Area for improvement — topic sentences are often generic and don’t clearly connect to a strong thesis.
- Evidence & Development: Strength — you offer plausible reasons (production jobs replaced, skilled jobs affected, new tech jobs created). Area for improvement — claims are vague and need specific examples/explanations.
- Language Use: Strength — meaning is often understandable. Area for improvement — many spelling, grammar, punctuation, and word-choice errors interfere with clarity.

3) Which of these do you want to focus on in this session?
- Options: (A) Revise the thesis so it’s stronger and previews main points; (B) Improve topic sentence and unity in one paragraph; (C) Work on grammar and word choice in that paragraph. Pick one or two (please confirm which). 

Once you confirm your priorities, we’ll start Step 1 (thesis revision). If your top priority is the thesis, I’ll give feedback on your current thesis and then suggest a revised version. Would you like to try rewriting the thesis first, or would you like me to suggest a revision now? 

If you want me to suggest one now, here’s targeted feedback on your current thesis:
- Current thesis: “I believe automation will shift ultimately undermine global employment prespects in the long term.”
- Feedback: It states your position but has word order and spelling problems. It doesn’t preview the main reasons you’ll discuss. Use confident, direct language and preview 2–3 main points.

Suggested revised thesis (I can paste this into your full essay if you want):
- “Automation will ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term because it will replace many routine production jobs, encroach on skilled professions through adaptable software, and create only a limited number of technical roles that cannot fully offset the job losses.”

If you’re happy with that direction, I’ll put this revised thesis into the full essay text now. Do you want to try rewriting it yourself first or should I insert the suggested thesis into your draft?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:53:30.378Z

**You:** Revise topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:54:38.498Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for that clear request. Before I revise anything, let’s confirm our targets so we stay focused.

1) Goals — you wrote “Revise topic sentences.” Just to confirm:
- Is your top priority: improving topic sentences so they connect clearly to the thesis? Or do you also want me to fix the thesis first (we must do that in Step 1 of the process)? You can answer:
  - A — Topic sentences only (but I’ll still give short feedback on the thesis)
  - B — Revise the thesis and then revise topic sentence + paragraph (recommended)

2) Quick diagnostic summary (short):
- Thesis & Argument: position is clear but the thesis is weak, has errors, and doesn’t preview reasons.
- Organization: paragraphs exist and attempt structure, but topic sentences don’t clearly connect to a strong thesis.
- Evidence & Development: ideas are plausible but vague; need clearer explanation/examples.
- Language Use: many spelling, grammar, punctuation, and word-choice errors interfere with clarity.

3) Confirm the specific paragraph you want to work on:
- Paragraph 1 (about production jobs being replaced)
- Paragraph 2 (about automation affecting skilled/professional jobs)
- Paragraph 3 (acknowledging new tech jobs like programmers/teachers)

Which option do you choose? Also tell me whether you want me to:
- Let you try rewriting the thesis now, or
- Suggest a revised thesis for you to accept or tweak (I can paste it into the essay after you confirm).

Once you confirm (A or B) and which paragraph, we’ll start Step 1 (thesis revision). Would you like to try rewriting the thesis first, or shall I offer a suggested revision right away?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:54:53.711Z

**You:** Paragraph 1 2 3

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:55:52.598Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for that clear direction. Before we begin the three-step revision, let’s agree the learning targets so we stay focused.

1) Quick check on your main goal
- Do you want:
  A — Focus only on improving topic sentences (I’ll give brief feedback on the thesis but won’t revise it), or
  B — Revise the thesis first, then revise the chosen topic sentence and paragraph (recommended because topic sentences should match a stronger thesis)?

2) Which paragraph do you want to work on? (Pick one)
- Paragraph 1 — production jobs replaced by machines
- Paragraph 2 — skilled/professional jobs affected
- Paragraph 3 — new tech jobs (programmers/teachers)

3) Thesis rewrite preference
- Would you like to try rewriting the thesis yourself, or would you like me to suggest a revised thesis for you to accept/tweak?

Brief diagnostic summary (so you know what we’ll focus on)
- Thesis & Argument: clear position but the thesis is weak, has errors, and doesn’t preview reasons.
- Organization: paragraphs exist, but topic sentences don’t clearly connect to a strong thesis.
- Evidence & Development: ideas are plausible but need clearer explanation and examples.
- Language Use: many spelling/grammar errors that reduce clarity.

Please reply with:
- A or B (your choice),
- Paragraph number (1, 2, or 3),
- And whether you want to rewrite the thesis yourself or have me suggest one.

Once you confirm, we’ll start Step 1 (thesis revision). Would you like to proceed?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:56:01.673Z

**You:** B

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:56:23.923Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing B. That means we’ll (1) revise the thesis first, then (2) revise one topic sentence, and (3) revise that paragraph’s content. Quick recap of our targets so we stay focused:
- Primary goal: strengthen the thesis so it clearly answers the question and previews main points.
- Secondary goal: make one paragraph’s topic sentence and supporting sentences connect clearly to the new thesis.
- Language: we’ll also check clarity and word choice in that paragraph, but we’ll not copy-edit the whole essay.

Two quick questions before we start Step 1:
1) Which paragraph do you want to work on? Pick one:
   - Paragraph 1 (production jobs replaced)
   - Paragraph 2 (skilled/professional jobs affected)
   - Paragraph 3 (new tech jobs like programmers/teachers)

2) For the thesis: would you like to
   A — try rewriting the thesis yourself now (I’ll give feedback), or
   B — have me suggest a revised thesis for you to accept or tweak?

Also, please paste or confirm your current thesis (you already have: “I believe automation will shift ultimately undermine global employment prespects in the long term.”) if you want me to use that as the starting point.

Which paragraph number and A or B for the thesis?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:56:32.393Z

**You:** Paragraph A B C

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:57:04.890Z

**Assistant:** Nice — we’re ready to begin. Quick recap of our agreed targets so we stay focused:

- Primary goal: strengthen the thesis so it clearly answers the question and previews the main reasons.  
- Secondary goal: revise one paragraph’s topic sentence and supporting sentences so they connect to the new thesis.  
- Light language checks in that paragraph (clarity and word choice), but we won’t copy-edit the whole essay.

Two quick choices for you (please reply with your answers):

1) Which paragraph do you want to work on? Type 1, 2, or 3.
- 1 = production jobs replaced by machines (your first body paragraph)
- 2 = skilled/professional jobs affected (second paragraph)
- 3 = new tech jobs such as programmers/teachers (third paragraph)

2) For the thesis, would you like to:
- A — Try rewriting the thesis yourself now (I’ll give feedback), or
- B — Have me suggest a revised thesis for you to accept or tweak?

Also, please confirm whether you want me to use your current thesis (“I believe automation will shift ultimately undermine global employment prespects in the long term.”) as the starting point, or whether you prefer to start fresh.

When you reply with the paragraph number, A or B, and thesis-start preference, we’ll begin Step 1 (thesis revision). Would you like to proceed?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:57:12.317Z

**You:** 1 2 3 B

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:57:31.995Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — quick clarification before we begin: you listed “1 2 3 B.” I need you to pick ONE body paragraph to work on (please reply with 1, 2, or 3). We’ll follow plan B (I’ll suggest a revised thesis first), then revise the chosen paragraph’s topic sentence and content.

Here is my suggested revised thesis (clear, confident, previews the three reasons):

Automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because it will replace many routine production jobs, encroach on skilled professions through adaptable software, and create only a limited number of technical roles that cannot fully offset those losses.

Do you want to:
- Accept this thesis as-is, or
- Tweak it (say what you’d like changed), or
- Try rewriting it yourself?

Also: which paragraph shall we work on now — 1, 2, or 3? Once you confirm (paragraph number + whether to accept or tweak the thesis), I’ll move to Step 2 and we’ll revise that paragraph’s topic sentence.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:57:42.821Z

**You:** 1

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:58:16.577Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. I confirm we’ll work on:
- Plan B (I suggested a revised thesis), and
- Paragraph 1 (the paragraph about production jobs being replaced).

Step 1 — Thesis revision
Here is the suggested revised thesis again (clear, confident, previews the three main reasons):

Automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because it will replace many routine production jobs, encroach on skilled professions through adaptable software, and create only a limited number of technical roles that cannot fully offset those losses.

Would you like to:
- Accept this thesis as-is (I’ll insert it into your essay now), or
- Tweak it (tell me one change you want), or
- Try rewriting it yourself (I’ll give feedback)?

If you accept, I’ll paste the full essay with the new thesis and then we’ll move to Step 2 (revise paragraph 1’s topic sentence). For Step 2: do you want to try rewriting the topic sentence now, or would you like a few guided sentence starters and feedback first?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:58:30.710Z

**You:** Accept this thesis as-is

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:59:03.922Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for accepting the thesis and choosing paragraph 1. I’ve inserted the revised thesis into your essay below. Read it and check that it still says what you want.

Full essay with the new thesis inserted:
---
Automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because it will replace many routine production jobs, encroach on skilled professions through adaptable software, and create only a limited number of technical roles that cannot fully offset those losses.

Firstly, automation will greatly decrease job oppertunity. Since machines and it‘s software could be muti tasking 24 hours non stop. Less workers will be needed during production tasks. So factories or workplacr would choose hiring less human labours. Also, human labours will cause more error compare with auto machines and softwares. Not to mention the inserinces of human labours. So from a long term aspect, automation will lead to a decrease in employment rate due to the higher efficency and budgget efficency brought by automation.

Secondly, automation can tackle different kind of worktasks, more superior then human. In some developed countries, they are facing aging poplukation problem, huch greatly decreases the young labour forces. Although in some undeveloped regions they will could provided large number of young labour forces, but most of them dom’t have professional knowledge skills. Like in medical, finace, nuclear energy. However, automation could handle different kinds of task load. And could be modified easily to counter another kind of taskload. Making bussiness owner more unwilling to spend large amount of money to hiner professional talents. Because in the database of automachies already have it. So automation will even overthrown the employment rate in professional job aspect and lead to loweerempolyment prospects in long term.

However, automation could bring some enhancement on employment rate in some aspects. Since this kind of automation machines need to be programmed by humans. So talents in machine programming and teachers in this aspect also required. Their employment rate will be grown as the influenice of automationin different areas. So automation would still bring some positive effects on the employment rate of programmers and their teachers.
---

Step 2 — Topic sentence revision (paragraph 1)
Your current topic sentence for paragraph 1 is:
"Firstly, automation will greatly decrease job oppertunity."

Quick feedback on that sentence and how it connects to the new thesis:
- Strengths: It states the main idea of the paragraph (job losses).
- What to improve:
  - Specificity: The thesis mentions “routine production jobs.” Make the topic sentence point to that kind of work (manufacturing, routine tasks) rather than a vague “job opportunity.”
  - Connection: Signal clearly that this paragraph gives one of the reasons the thesis lists (e.g., replacement of routine production work).
  - Language: Fix spelling and use confident phrasing (avoid “greatly” as a vague intensifier).

Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence now, or would you like a few sentence starters to help you begin? I encourage you to try first — then I’ll give targeted feedback.

If you want starters, finish one of these stems (don’t worry about grammar yet; I’ll help polish it):
- "In manufacturing and other routine industries, automation will..."
- "One major effect of automation is that it can replace routine production roles by..."
- "Because machines can operate continuously and handle repetitive tasks, employers are likely to..."
- "Automation reduces the need for human labor in production because..."

Try finishing one of those stems now (one short sentence). When you post it, I’ll give focused feedback on clarity, strength, and how well it links to the thesis.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T07:59:21.135Z

**You:** try rewriting the topic sentence now Automation reduces the need for human labor in production because machines could muti task non stop

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:01:24.205Z

**Assistant:** Nice attempt — good job connecting the idea to the paragraph. Quick, specific feedback:

- Strengths: your sentence clearly links automation to reduced need for human labor — that matches the thesis.
- Fixes to make:
  - Spelling/word choice: “muti task” → multitask; “non stop” → nonstop or “operate continuously.”
  - Make the sentence point to routine/production work (so it ties tightly to the thesis).
  - Use confident language (e.g., “reduces” or “is likely to reduce” rather than “could”).

Try this short revised topic sentence (pick it or tweak it):
- Automation reduces the need for human labor in routine production because machines can operate continuously and perform multiple tasks.

If you’re happy with that, I’ll insert it into your essay and then we’ll move to Step 3 (revise that paragraph’s supporting sentences). I’ve pasted the full essay below with the topic sentence replaced so you can see how it reads in context.

Full essay with the revised topic sentence:
---

Would you like to:
- Accept that topic sentence as final and move to Step 3 (revise the supporting sentences in paragraph 1), or
- Tweak the topic sentence (tell me what you’d change)?

If you want to try revising the supporting sentences yourself first, I’ll give targeted guidance; otherwise I can offer guiding questions and a few short prompts to help you improve them. Which do you prefer?

 essay

**Assistant:** Done — I’ve inserted the revised thesis and the improved topic sentence into your essay. Here is the full text with those changes:

Automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because it will replace many routine production jobs, encroach on skilled professions through adaptable software, and create only a limited number of technical roles that cannot fully offset those losses.

Firstly, automation reduces the need for human labor in routine production because machines can operate continuously and perform multiple tasks. Since machines and it‘s software could be muti tasking 24 hours non stop. Less workers will be needed during production tasks. So factories or workplacr would choose hiring less human labours. Also, human labours will cause more error compare with auto machines and softwares. Not to mention the inserinces of human labours. So from a long term aspect, automation will lead to a decrease in employment rate due to the higher efficency and budgget efficency brought by automation.

Secondly, automation can tackle different kind of worktasks, more superior then human. In some developed countries, they are facing aging poplukation problem, huch greatly decreases the young labour forces. Although in some undeveloped regions they will could provided large number of young labour forces, but most of them dom’t have professional knowledge skills. Like in medical, finace, nuclear energy. However, automation could handle different kinds of task load. And could be modified easily to counter another kind of taskload. Making bussiness owner more unwilling to spend large amount of money to hiner professional talents. Because in the database of automachies already have it. So automation will even overthrown the employment rate in professional job aspect and lead to loweerempolyment prospects in long term.

However, automation could bring some enhancement on employment rate in some aspects. Since this kind of automation machines need to be programmed by humans. So talents in machine programming and teachers in this aspect also required. Their employment rate will be grown as the influenice of automationin different areas. So automation would still bring some positive effects on the employment rate of programmers and their teachers.

Step 3 — Next choices (revise paragraph 1 supporting sentences)
Would you like to:
- A — Try revising the supporting sentences yourself now (I’ll give focused feedback), or
- B — Get a few short sentence-starters and guided hints for specific sentences, or
- C — Ask me to point out the two or three sentences that most need fixing before you edit?

If you pick B or C, here are three specific sentences I suggest we work on and a short starter for each (use these to begin your revision — try one and I’ll give feedback):

1) Original: "Since machines and it‘s software could be muti tasking 24 hours non stop."
   Starter: "Because machines and their software can operate continuously and handle multiple functions, ..."

2) Original: "Less workers will be needed during production tasks."
   Starter: "As a result, employers will need fewer workers for routine production roles because ..."

3) Original: "Also, human labours will cause more error compare with auto machines and softwares."
   Starter: "Human workers are more likely to make errors in repetitive tasks than automated systems, which ..."

Which option do you choose (A, B, or C)? If you want to try revising now, post one revised sentence and I’ll respond with targeted feedback.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:02:27.305Z

**You:** C

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:03:37.854Z

**Assistant:** Good choice — I’ll point out the 3 sentences in paragraph 1 that most need fixing and give focused, short guidance so you can edit them.

Sentence 1 (problematic)
- Original: "Since machines and it‘s software could be muti tasking 24 hours non stop."
- Problems: grammar and word choice (it‘s → their; muti tasking → multitask), awkward phrasing, and weak modal (“could be”) when you want a confident cause-effect link.
- What to do: make it one clear causal clause that explains why machines replace people.
- Starter you can finish: "Because machines and their software can operate continuously and multitask, ..."

Sentence 2 (problematic)
- Original: "Less workers will be needed during production tasks."
- Problems: word choice (“Less” → “Fewer”), vague phrasing (“during production tasks” is unclear), choppy sentence that would read better joined to sentence 1 as result.
- What to do: state the result clearly and link it to routine production work.
- Starter you can finish: "As a result, employers will need fewer workers for routine production tasks because ..."

Sentence 3 (problematic)
- Original: "Also, human labours will cause more error compare with auto machines and softwares."
- Problems: word/grammar errors (“labours” → “labour” or “workers”; “cause more error” → “are more likely to make errors”); awkward phrase “auto machines and softwares” → “automated systems/software.”
- What to do: explain why humans make more errors in repetitive tasks and why that encourages automation.
- Starter you can finish: "Human workers are more likely to make errors in repetitive tasks than automated systems, which ..."

Optional quick note (one more sentence if you want)
- Sentence: "Not to mention the inserinces of human labours." — this seems to mean extra costs like insurance and benefits. If you keep it, be specific: "employers also face extra costs (wages, benefits, insurance), which makes automation more attractive."

Next step
- Try revising one of the three sentences now (pick whichever feels easiest). Post your revision and I’ll give focused feedback and help you polish it so the paragraph is clearer and connected to the topic sentence.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:03:55.594Z

**You:** Sentence 1  Because machines and their software can operate continuously and multitask for 24 hours

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:05:37.477Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that’s a clear attempt and a good idea. Quick, targeted feedback before you revise again.

What’s good
- The clause explains why machines replace people (continuous operation + multitasking) — that’s exactly the point we need.

Small problems to fix
- Grammar/word choice: use their (not it‘s); multitask (verb) or multitasking (noun) — but in this clause “can multitask” or “can perform multiple tasks” works best.
- Style: a clause starting with Because needs a main clause (it’s currently a fragment). Either attach it to the next sentence or finish it with the result.
- Wordiness: “for 24 hours” is fine but “around the clock” or “continuously” is more natural and concise.

Two short stems you can finish (pick one and try it)
- Because machines and their software can operate continuously and multitask, ...
- Machines and their software can operate around the clock and perform multiple tasks, which means ...

Try finishing one of those now (one short sentence). When you post it, I’ll give focused feedback and then we’ll update the full paragraph.

Below I put your current essay with your sentence inserted so you can see it in context. (I haven’t changed anything else — just placed your sentence where it belongs.)

Your turn — pick a stem and finish the sentence (one short line).

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:05:54.911Z

**You:** Because machines and their software can operate continuously and multitask around the clock

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:08:01.071Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that sentence has the right idea. Quick note: starting a sentence with "Because ..." often creates a fragment unless you finish the main clause. I polished your line into a complete, confident sentence and smoothed the next few supporting sentences in paragraph 1 so the paragraph reads clearly and links to the thesis.

Below is the full essay with the thesis and paragraph 1 updated (I only revised the thesis and paragraph 1, as agreed):

Automation will undermine global employment prospects in the long term because it will replace many routine production jobs, encroach on skilled professions through adaptable software, and create only a limited number of technical roles that cannot fully offset those losses.

Firstly, automation reduces the need for human labor in routine production because machines can operate continuously and perform multiple tasks. Because machines and their software can operate around the clock and multitask, employers need fewer workers for routine production roles. Factories and other workplaces therefore often choose to hire fewer human workers. Human workers are also more likely to make errors during repetitive tasks than automated systems, and employers may view machines as cheaper and more reliable over time. For these reasons, automation tends to lower employment rates in routine production by improving operational and budgetary efficiency.

Secondly, automation can tackle different kind of worktasks, more superior then human. In some developed countries, they are facing aging poplukation problem, huch greatly decreases the young labour forces. Although in some undeveloped regions they will could provided large number of young labour forces, but most of them dom’t have professional knowledge skills. Like in medical, finace, nuclear energy. However, automation could handle different kinds of task load. And could be modified easily to counter another kind of taskload. Making bussiness owner more unwilling to spend large amount of money to hiner professional talents. Because in the database of automachies already have it. So automation will even overthrown the employment rate in professional job aspect and lead to loweerempolyment prospects in long term.

However, automation could bring some enhancement on employment rate in some aspects. Since this kind of automation machines need to be programmed by humans. So talents in machine programming and teachers in this aspect also required. Their employment rate will be grown as the influenice of automationin different areas. So automation would still bring some positive effects on the employment rate of programmers and their teachers.

Quick explanation of what I changed and why:
- I turned your fragment into a full sentence: starting with "Because..." needs a main clause, so I completed the thought and connected it to the result (fewer workers).
- I adjusted word choice and grammar in several supporting sentences in paragraph 1 so the cause–effect chain is clearer (machines operate continuously → employers need fewer workers → employers prefer automation for reliability and cost).
- I left paragraphs 2 and 3 as they were (we agreed to focus on paragraph 1). They still need revision (topic sentences, evidence, and language), but we’ll do that later if you want.

Would you like to:
- Accept this version of paragraph 1 and move on to revising a specific sentence in paragraph 2 or 3? or
- Try rewriting one of the sentences in paragraph 1 yourself (for practice), and I’ll give feedback? or
- Ask me to point out the next 2–3 sentences in paragraph 1 that would most help if you revise them?

Pick one and we’ll continue.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:08:26.054Z

**You:** Accept this version of paragraph 1 and move on to revising a specific sentence in paragraph 2 or 3

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:09:47.441Z

**Assistant:** Great — and well done so far. Quick reminder: in this session we agreed to revise the thesis and one body paragraph (paragraph 1). We’ve finished that work and you accepted the changes. I can’t fully revise another paragraph in this same three-step cycle unless you want to expand our session. But I can definitely help you improve one specific sentence in paragraph 2 or 3 by guiding you and giving short starters — and then you can try the revision and I’ll give focused feedback.

Please choose:
- Which paragraph do you want to work on: 2 (skilled/professional jobs) or 3 (new tech jobs)?
- Do you want to:
  A — Try rewriting the sentence yourself now (I’ll give feedback), or
  B — Use one of the short sentence starters I give and then tweak it?

If you pick paragraph 2 or 3, here are two tight starters for each to help you begin (pick one and finish it, or write your own):

Paragraph 2 (skilled/professional jobs) — pick a starter
- "Automation increasingly encroaches on skilled professions because adaptable software can perform complex tasks such as _____."
- "Beyond routine work, many professional roles (for example _____) are vulnerable to automation because _____."

Paragraph 3 (new tech jobs) — pick a starter
- "Although automation destroys many routine roles, it also creates technical jobs in programming and maintenance; however, these positions are _____ and therefore _____." 
- "Automation will generate some new jobs in software development and system upkeep, but these roles are often fewer in number and require specialized training, which means _____."

Quick next step: tell me (1) paragraph number (2 or 3) and (A or B). Then either paste your revision or finish a starter — I’ll respond with focused, encouraging feedback and a short suggestion to refine it.
