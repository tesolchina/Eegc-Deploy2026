            ## 🟤 Grading Result *(Hidden from Students)*

            # STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 16/25 - The original essay had a clear central idea (automation changes jobs), but ideas were thinly developed and repetitive (e.g., repeated claims that "AI cannot think like a human"). The argument lacked specific examples and deeper explanation.
- Organization: 16/25 - A basic paragraph structure existed (intro, body, conclusion), but paragraphs repeated the same points and transitions were weak. The logical progression was obvious but not well developed.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Limited variety and several awkward choices ("manufactory," "we need to employ more employees," "labours"). Some topic words (automation, AI) used, but many collocations and phrasing were inaccurate.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Frequent grammatical and phrasing errors affecting clarity (articles, verb forms, punctuation, spacing). Example: "resulting in boost in technological industries," and "It may lead to a brighter global employment prospects in long term."
- **Original Essay Total: 61/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised essay has a clear, confident thesis: "Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects because it creates new technical and maintenance positions and shifts workers into higher‑skilled, creative roles." The student develops two clear reasons with named roles and mechanisms (paragraph 2 and paragraph 3). Evidence is still mostly general and could be strengthened with facts or citations.
- Organization: 21/25 - The essay now follows a clearer roadmap: thesis, paragraph on technical/maintenance roles, paragraph on shifting to higher‑skilled creative roles, conclusion. Topic sentences explicitly link to the thesis. Some transitions and repetitiveness remain but overall flow improved.
- Vocabulary: 19/25 - Noticeable improvements: use of "deploy," "quality‑assurance staff," "outputs," "streamlines," "brand strategists." Some remaining collocation, word-choice and repetition issues (e.g., "resulting in boost in technological industries" left earlier; occasional awkward phrasings like "firm competitiveness" repeated).
- Grammar: 18/25 - Many sentence-level errors were corrected (subject-verb agreement fixed, hyphenation, clearer clause structure), but residual issues persist (occasional missing articles, punctuation errors, and minor awkward sentences). Examples of improved sentences: "As companies deploy more AI systems to complete routine tasks, they must hire technicians..." but elsewhere small slips remain.
- **Revised Essay Total: 79/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +18 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Revised, stronger thesis that clearly previews the main reasons and uses confident language.
  - Clearer and stronger topic sentences: e.g., "First, automation creates new technical and maintenance positions, such as AI technicians and maintenance engineers."
  - Expanded and unified paragraph 2 with named roles, explanation of mechanisms and a linking sentence: e.g., "As companies deploy more AI systems ... they must hire technicians ... Because AI lacks human judgment ... people are still needed ... Together, these developments show ...".
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Add factual evidence, statistics or a cited study to strengthen claims (e.g., reports on job creation, reskilling outcomes).
  - Final proofreading to remove remaining small errors and improve collocations (e.g., "resulting in boost in technological industries" should be "resulting in a boost in the tech sector").
  - Reduce some repetition and tighten transitions (some ideas are restated across paragraphs rather than progressed).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges:** ~61 messages (many iterative exchanges between student and assistant)
- **Conversation Quality:** Highly interactive and iterative. The student and AI followed a structured 3‑step revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph revision). The student repeatedly drafted, accepted guidance, and produced multiple revisions. Example evidence: repeated thesis rewrites culminating in "Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects because it creates new technical and maintenance positions and shifts workers into higher‑skilled, creative roles." The chat shows iterative improvements to paragraph 2 and paragraph 3, and the student requested targeted vocabulary and paragraph-length advice.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - Detailed, sustained exchanges (≈61 messages). The chat includes iterative cycles across many aspects (thesis, topic sentences, paragraph support, vocabulary, conclusion). The student and assistant followed a multi-step plan and produced many drafts and micro-edits.
  - Evidence: Long chain of back-and-forth starting with session framing: assistant described a three-step revision process and the student followed through. Example: assistant's stepwise prompts and the student's multiple revised thesis/topic sentences (many messages).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - Proficient critical engagement. The student sometimes challenged the assistant (for example: "the topic is about automation, not climate change") and made independent choices (chose Option B to keep topic). The student accepted many suggestions but also made independent rewrites and selective edits rather than blindly following every AI suggestion.
  - Evidence: Student insisted on keeping automation topic after assistant noted the climate prompt mismatch; student produced their own thesis and multiple rewrites rather than just copying model phrasing. The student requested targeted vocabulary improvements and further paragraph expansion.
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - Excellent iterative process with multiple meaningful revision cycles. The student revised the thesis, then topic sentences, then supporting sentences; repeated micro-edits and vocabulary improvements; expanded paragraph 2 with examples and a linking sentence.
  - Evidence: Multiple cycles: thesis revised several times; paragraph 2 expanded from a weak topic sentence to three polished sentences; paragraph 3 revised through successive drafts addressing grammar and parallelism.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear improvement in rhetorical organization: the thesis, topic sentences, and paragraph development now align (evidence: final thesis and paragraph topic sentences).
- Effective iterative collaboration: the student followed the assistant's three-step revision plan and produced multiple drafts, demonstrating engaged editing and learning.
- Increased precision in vocabulary and role naming: use of terms like "AI technicians," "quality-assurance staff," "deploy," "streamlines," and "context‑sensitive decisions" improved clarity.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Grammar and micro-editing: finish a final proofreading pass to fix residual errors (articles, punctuation, minor collocations). Recommendation: read aloud or run one final grammar pass focused on articles, hyphenation, and repeated phrasing.
- Evidence and development: strengthen claims with concrete data, citations, or at least one concrete, specific example with brief numbers or a referenced report to increase credibility.
- Concision and repetition: reduce repeated phrasings across paragraphs; ensure each paragraph advances the argument (avoid restating the same sentence ideas).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student gave topic preference and chose Option B to keep automation, repeatedly clarified goals (e.g., "Make the thesis clear and stronger", "improve vocabulary"), which helped the assistant target revisions.
  - Evidence: Student correction: "the topic is about automation, not climate change" and persistent direction-setting.
- **Strategic Planning**: Excellent - Student followed the assistant's 3-step plan and selected targets for each step, indicating planning and use of AI scaffolding.
  - Evidence: Student chose to work on thesis → topic sentence → paragraph revision and requested paragraph expansion strategies.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good - The student selectively accepted and modified AI suggestions, challenged the assistant on topic alignment, and produced original rewrites to fit their voice.
  - Evidence: Student rewrote many sentences and chose phrasings (e.g., converted assistant models into their own versions).
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The student produced multiple independent revisions and applied vocabulary suggestions; they did not simply copy the assistant's models but used them to produce original edits.
  - Evidence: Student wrote numerous refinements themselves (final paragraph sentences and conclusion).

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Final proofreading pass focused on grammar and collocations: check articles, subject-verb agreement, punctuation, hyphenation (e.g., "time-consuming," "context‑sensitive"), and remove duplicated phrases.
2. Add at least one concrete piece of evidence or a short, named example (report, industry case, or statistic) to support the thesis—this will strengthen Content and Ideas significantly.
3. Practice concision and varied sentence structure: reduce sentence-level repetition and vary openings to improve flow and readability.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student engaged in a sustained, iterative revision process with clear improvements to thesis, paragraph unity, and vocabulary. This demonstrates strong learning behavior in AI-assisted writing.
- Confirm assignment prompt expectations: early in the chat the assistant noted the original climate-change prompt mismatch; the student insisted on keeping the automation topic. If the essay is to be submitted for the original climate prompt, remind the student to adapt content to the assigned question. If the automation topic was the assignment, then current drafts are appropriate and show good progress.
- For grading purposes, the revised essay is a clear improvement but still needs a final proofreading pass and stronger evidence to reach an "Excellent" score range.

If you would like, I can:
- Provide a final polished version of the essay with all micro-edits applied, or
- Suggest one or two authoritative sources the student could cite to strengthen claims about automation and job creation.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
In recent years, automation is not an unfamiliar term for us. Employers use AI to perform routine tasks to reduce hiring costs and enhance efficiency. Automation is transforming industries, resulting in boost in technological industries. Technological shift may ultimately enhance global employment prospects in long term.

Technological shift may result in creation of new jobs. For example, as we create and make more AI to help us complete repeated tasks, we need to employ more employees for AI maintenance or checking and verifying the quality of AI outcomes. Although AI is powerful, it cannot really act like a human and have human values, which depend on different situations, causing different actions and decisions that we make. AI cannot think like a human being and act like a human.

Technological transformation can speed up the entire process in manufactory by automation, freeing humans to focus on high-level tasks. Humans do not need to perform repeated tasks and AI will help us to finish it , allowing humans to focus on creativity, logical thinking and jobs that require empathy. AI just acts as a helper to speed up our work , enhancing efficiency but it cannot completely replace humans. Moreover, we can have more time for other jobs.

To conclude, automation may cause some job replacement, while it also creates more job opportunities for humans and speeds up the processes in jobs. It may lead to a brighter global employment prospects in long term.

Revised:
In recent years, automation has not been an unfamiliar term for us. Employers deploy AI to automate routine tasks to reduce hiring costs and enhance efficiency. Automation is transforming industries, resulting in a boost in the tech sector. Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects because it creates new technical and maintenance positions and shifts workers into higher-skilled, creative roles.

First, automation creates new technical and maintenance positions, such as AI technicians and maintenance engineers. As companies deploy more AI systems to complete routine tasks, they must hire technicians to maintain systems and quality-assurance staff to ensure outputs meet standards. AI lacks human judgment and ethical reasoning, and therefore humans are still needed to interpret  results and make context‑sensitive decisions. Together, these developments show that automation not only displaces tasks but also creates technical and maintenance roles that support the thesis.

Second, speeding up the manufacturing process via automation allows employees to shift into higher-skilled, creative roles such as product design and strategic problem-solving. As automation streamlines time-consuming, routine production tasks, it allows workers to focus on higher‑skilled, creative, and interpersonal tasks that require empathy and judgment. For example, in roles like brand strategists, creative skills are more important than performing repetitive tasks. Creativity leads to new products and services and helps employees remain competitive, which contributes to firm competitiveness.

To conclude, automation displaces some routine roles, while ultimately improving long‑term employment prospects because it creates technical and maintenance positions and shifts workers into higher‑skilled, creative roles. This shift therefore points to a long‑term opportunity for workers who adapt.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:03:22.011Z

**You:** Technological shift may ultimately enhance global employment prospects in long term.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:06:39.896Z

**Assistant:** Hi — I’m glad you’ve shared your draft. Before we begin revising, let’s set clear goals and diagnose the essay so we can work efficiently.

1) Your goals
Quick question: what do you most want to improve in this session? (Choose any that apply or add your own.)
- Make the thesis clear and directly answer the prompt
- Make paragraph topic sentences and structure match the thesis
- Improve coherence and logical progression
- Improve vocabulary and word choice
- Fix grammar and sentence-level errors
- Other: __________

2) Short diagnostic feedback (using the rubric categories)
- Content & Ideas: The current essay discusses automation and AI’s impact on jobs. The assignment prompt asks whether individual actions matter vs. governments/corporations in fighting climate change. So the main issue is topic mismatch — the essay does not answer the question. Strengths: you present a clear viewpoint about automation creating and changing jobs, with repeated supporting ideas. Weakness: off-topic for the given prompt; arguments are basic and need more development and relevance to the task.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Paragraphs repeat similar ideas (AI cannot replace humans; automation creates jobs). Topic sentences and conclusions repeat the same thesis. Transitions are weak; the overall structure doesn’t progress through clear reasons supporting a response to the assigned question. 
- Vocabulary: Some repetition and awkward phrasing (“we need to employ more employees,” “manufactory,” “finish it , allowing”). There are some topic-specific terms (automation, AI), but many word choices need polishing.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Several grammar, punctuation, and article errors; sentence variety is limited. This affects clarity.

3) Important decision point
The biggest overall problem is that your essay doesn’t respond to the assignment prompt (climate change vs. automation). Would you like to:
A) Revise this essay so it directly answers the climate-change prompt (“To what extent do you agree or disagree…”)? This will require changing your thesis and reworking paragraphs (likely rewriting content to be about individual vs. governmental/corporate action).
B) Keep the current topic (automation and jobs) but adapt the thesis so the essay becomes a different assignment (note: this will not meet the original prompt and would likely lose marks).
Tell me which option you choose. If A, we should focus first on creating a clear thesis that answers the climate prompt.

4) Choose specific revision targets for this session
From the diagnosed issues, which 1–3 things do you want to focus on now? (You can pick one at first — we’ll follow the three-step revision: thesis, one topic sentence, then that paragraph.)
- Fix thesis to directly answer the prompt and preview main points
- Revise a body paragraph’s topic sentence to link to the new thesis
- Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and evidence
- Improve grammar/sentence structure in the paragraph you choose
- Improve vocabulary in that paragraph

5) Next step (after you confirm)
- If you want to answer the climate prompt (option A), please confirm and then share (or confirm) your current thesis. If you prefer, the sentence “Technological shift may ultimately enhance global employment prospects in long term.” is not a thesis for the climate prompt; tell me if you want to try a new one now or would like help drafting it.
- Also tell me which body paragraph you want to revise (paragraph 2 or 3 from your draft), and which revision targets from #4 you select.

When you confirm your choices, we’ll start Step 1 (thesis revision). Would you like to proceed and which option do you choose (A or B)?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:07:00.236Z

**You:** Make the thesis clear and directly answer the prompt

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:07:53.761Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing a clear target. Just to confirm: you want to revise this essay so it directly answers the climate-change prompt (Option A). That’s the best choice if we want to meet the assignment.

Quick checklist before we begin Step 1 (thesis):
- Decide your stance: Do you agree, disagree, or partially agree that individual actions are insignificant compared with governments/corporations?
- Be specific about the degree of agreement (e.g., “largely disagree” or “agree to a limited extent”).
- Preview 2–3 clear reasons you will develop in the essay (these become your paragraph roadmap).
- Use confident, precise language (avoid “I think,” “maybe,” “might,” etc.).

Example structure (not a full sentence — a short template to help you build your own thesis):
- [Degree of agreement] + that individuals matter because: 1) [reason about collective impact/behaviour change], 2) [reason about social pressure or market demand], 3) [reason about supporting policy and holding corporations accountable].

Now please do two things:
1) Tell me which body paragraph you want to revise with me in Steps 2–3 (paragraph 2 or paragraph 3 from your draft).
2) Try writing a revised thesis that answers the prompt and follows the checklist above. Type your thesis here (give it a go — I’ll give feedback and help you improve it).

If you’d like, I can give short model phrases to help you start a sentence, but first I’d like you to attempt a full thesis sentence so we can practice. Which paragraph will you pick to revise next?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:08:18.060Z

**You:** I agree that technological shift will ultimately enhances global employment prospects in a long term because it can lead to creation of new jobs and speed up the entire process to enable humans to focus on high-level tasks.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:17:31.984Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — good first try and thanks for choosing to revise for the climate-change prompt (Option A). A few quick, supportive notes before we start Step 1.

1) Feedback on your attempted thesis
- Main idea problem: Your sentence still argues about automation and jobs. The assignment asks about climate change — whether individual actions are insignificant compared with governments and corporations. So content must shift to state your position about individual vs. institutional responsibility for climate action.
- Grammar & wording to fix if you keep a similar idea: “will ultimately enhances” → “will ultimately enhance”; “in a long term” → “in the long term.” But first, change the content to the climate topic.
- Thesis purpose: It must (a) clearly answer the prompt (degree of agreement), (b) preview 2–3 main reasons you will develop, and (c) use confident, precise language.

2) Quick template to help you build a correct thesis (fill in the bracketed parts)
- [Degree of agreement], I/This essay argues that individual actions [are/are not] insignificant because: 1) [reason about collective behavior or direct emissions], 2) [reason about influencing markets/political pressure], 3) [reason about practical mitigation or complementing policy].

(That is a template — please use it to write your own single-sentence thesis. I’m not giving a full rewritten thesis for you; try one now.)

3) Choose the paragraph to revise next
Which body paragraph do you want to work on with me in Steps 2–3: paragraph 2 or paragraph 3 from your draft?

4) Pick 1–3 revision targets for this session
From these options, which do you want us to focus on now? (Pick up to three.)
- Fix thesis to directly answer the climate prompt and preview main points
- Revise a body paragraph’s topic sentence to link to the new thesis
- Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity, unity, and evidence
- Improve grammar/sentence structure in that paragraph
- Improve vocabulary/word choice in that paragraph

5) Next step
- Please (a) tell me which paragraph you choose (2 or 3), (b) pick your revision targets from #4, and (c) write a new thesis sentence using the template above. I’ll give focused feedback and then we’ll move to Step 2.

Would you like to try your revised thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:18:04.716Z

**You:** the topic is about automation, not climate change

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:31:16.111Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — that’s helpful. So you want to keep the essay topic on automation and jobs (Option B). That’s fine for practice, but a quick reminder: if this essay is being submitted for the given climate-change prompt, keeping the automation topic will not answer the assigned question and will likely lose marks. If you’re practicing writing generally, we can proceed with automation.

Before we begin the three-step revision process, let’s confirm targets and a plan.

1) Confirm learning/writing goals
Which of these do you most want to work on in this session? (Pick up to three.)
- Make the thesis clear and stronger
- Make paragraph topic sentences and structure match the thesis
- Improve coherence and logical progression
- Improve vocabulary and word choice
- Fix grammar and sentence-level errors
- Other: __________

2) Confirm which paragraph you want to revise with me
Which body paragraph shall we focus on for Steps 2–3? (Choose one)
- Paragraph 2 (the one about new jobs, AI maintenance)
- Paragraph 3 (the one about freeing humans for high-level tasks)

3) Thesis check (Step 1)
Please either:
- Paste the sentence you want to use as your thesis (if you have one), or
- Confirm that you want to improve this sentence from your draft: “Technological shift may ultimately enhance global employment prospects in long term.”

Guidance to help you write a stronger thesis about automation (use this to try one sentence):
- Make a clear claim (degree of certainty) about automation’s impact on employment.
- Preview 2–3 main reasons you will develop (these will guide your paragraphs).
- Use confident, precise language (no “maybe,” “I think,” or “may” if you want a strong thesis).

Quick template you can complete:
- “Automation will [positive/negative/mixed effect] on employment because 1) [reason], 2) [reason], and 3) [reason].”

Would you like to try writing one thesis sentence now using that template? After you write it, I’ll give brief feedback and then we’ll move to Step 2 (topic sentence revision for the paragraph you choose).

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:31:33.350Z

**You:** Make the thesis clear and stronger

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:39:32.663Z

**Assistant:** Great — glad you want to focus on the thesis. A few quick clarifying questions so we can target the work well:

1) Topic check — which do you want to do now?
- Option A: Revise the essay so it answers the climate-change prompt (individual actions vs. governments/corporations). This requires changing the thesis/content to that prompt.
- Option B: Keep the current topic (automation and employment) and make the thesis for that topic stronger.

Please pick A or B.

2) Which body paragraph would you like to revise later (for Steps 2–3)?
- Paragraph 2 (about job creation / AI maintenance)
- Paragraph 3 (about automation freeing humans for higher-level tasks)

3) Paste the sentence you want to use as your thesis, or confirm you want to improve this current sentence:
“Technological shift may ultimately enhance global employment prospects in long term.”

Before you try a new version, here are three short, practical tips for a stronger thesis:
- Make a clear, confident claim (use will/won’t or “largely”/“to an extent” rather than “may” or “maybe”).
- Preview 2–3 main reasons you will develop (these are your paragraph roadmap).
- Keep it one sentence and specific (use “in the long term,” include precise nouns, avoid vague phrases).

Two short template options (fill in the brackets — these are templates, not full sentences for you):
- If you choose Option B (automation): “Automation will [positive/negative/mixed effect] on employment because 1) [creation of new jobs], 2) [shift to higher-skilled roles], and 3) [economic/productivity effects that change demand].”
- If you choose Option A (climate prompt): “[Degree of agreement], individuals’ actions [are/are not] insignificant compared to governments/corporations because 1) [collective behaviour/consumption impact], 2) [influence on markets and social norms], and 3) [need for policy and infrastructure support].”

Would you like to try writing your revised thesis now using one of those templates? Paste it here and I’ll give focused, constructive feedback so you can refine it.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:39:55.141Z

**You:** B

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:40:39.619Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming Option B (keeping the automation/jobs topic). That’s fine for practice. A few quick next steps so we can start the three-step revision process.

1) Choose 1–3 revision targets for this session (pick up to three)
- Make the thesis clear and stronger
- Make paragraph topic sentences and structure match the thesis
- Improve coherence and logical progression
- Improve vocabulary and word choice
- Fix grammar and sentence-level errors

Which of these would you like to focus on?

2) Which body paragraph shall we revise together (Step 2–3)?
- Paragraph 2 (about new jobs / AI maintenance)
- Paragraph 3 (about freeing humans for higher-level tasks)

Which one do you choose?

3) Thesis check (Step 1)
Please either:
- Paste the thesis sentence you want to use now, or
- Confirm you want to improve this sentence: “Technological shift may ultimately enhance global employment prospects in long term.”

Try writing one sentence that: (a) makes a clear, confident claim about automation’s overall effect on employment and (b) previews 2–3 reasons you will develop. Short templates you can use or adapt:

- Strong positive claim: “Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects because 1) it creates new technical and maintenance roles, 2) it shifts workers into higher-skilled, creative jobs, and 3) it increases productivity that spurs economic growth and new demand.”
- Nuanced/mixed claim: “While automation will displace some routine jobs, it will improve long-term employment prospects by 1) creating new tech and support roles, 2) enabling workers to move into higher-value tasks, and 3) generating productivity gains that create new industries.”

Would you like to try writing your revised thesis now? Paste it here and I’ll give brief, focused feedback before we move to Step 2.

**You:** Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term because it creates new technical and maintenance positions and shifts labours into higher-skilled, creative jobs.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:45:50.747Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this is a much clearer claim than your original draft. Quick praise first: you make a confident argument (“will ultimately enhance”) and you preview reasons (creation of new roles; shift to higher-skilled work). That’s exactly the direction we want.

A few focused suggestions to strengthen the thesis before we move on:
- Remove redundancy: you say “ultimately” and “in the long term” (choose one). One clear time phrase is enough.
- Fix grammar and word choice: “shifts labours” is incorrect. Use “shifts workers into” or “moves workers into.” Also “labours” → “labor”/“labour” is usually a noun; here use “workers.”
- Consider adding a third reason (or make it clear you’ll develop two reasons only). The rubric likes a clear roadmap of 2–3 points.
- Improve parallel structure: make the reasons match grammatically (e.g., “because it creates…, shifts…, and generates…”).

I won’t rewrite the whole sentence for you — try this small template to rework it into one smoother thesis (fill in the blanks):

- For two reasons: “Automation will enhance global employment prospects because it creates [type of jobs], and it shifts workers into [type of roles].”
- For three reasons: “Automation will enhance global employment prospects because it creates [type of jobs], shifts workers into [higher-skilled roles], and [third reason: e.g., increases productivity that generates new demand].”

Would you like to try revising your thesis now using one of those templates? Paste your new version here and I’ll give quick feedback.

Also before we continue: which body paragraph do you want to work on next (paragraph 2 about AI maintenance/new jobs, or paragraph 3 about freeing humans for high-level tasks)? And which 1–3 revision targets shall we focus on (pick from: strengthen thesis, revise topic sentence, revise paragraph content for unity/clarity, fix grammar/sentence-level errors, improve vocabulary)? Once you post the revised thesis and pick the paragraph/targets, we’ll move to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:46:14.102Z

**You:** Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects because it creates new technical and maintenance positions, and it shifts workers into higher-skilled, creative jobs.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:49:35.947Z

**Assistant:** Nice—that thesis is a clear improvement: confident, focused, and it previews reasons. Well done.

A few short, actionable notes to tighten it further:
- Parallelism and concision: make the reasons match grammatically and remove small redundancies (you don’t need both “ultimately” and “in the long term” — one time phrase is enough).
- Word choice: use “roles” or “positions” consistently (e.g., “technical and maintenance roles”), and “higher‑skilled creative roles” is smoother than “higher‑skilled, creative jobs.”
- Consider whether you want two clear reasons (fine) or to add a third (e.g., productivity gains that create new demand). The rubric likes a clear roadmap.

Would you like to try one small revision now (one sentence) to apply those suggestions? If you prefer, I can offer one short model version for you to adapt.

Next, which body paragraph do you want us to revise together in Steps 2–3?
- Paragraph 2 (new jobs / AI maintenance)
- Paragraph 3 (automation freeing humans for high-level tasks)

And which revision targets shall we focus on for this session? Pick up to three:
- Strengthen thesis (done / further refine)
- Revise the chosen paragraph’s topic sentence to match the thesis
- Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity, unity, and evidence
- Fix grammar and sentence-level errors in that paragraph
- Improve vocabulary/word choice in that paragraph

Tell me:
1) Do you want to revise your thesis now (yes/no)? If yes, try a quick rewrite here or ask me for a short model.
2) Which paragraph (2 or 3)?
3) Which 1–3 targets from the list above?

Would you like to try a revised thesis sentence now, or shall I suggest a compact model for you to adapt?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:49:52.791Z

**You:** Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term because it creates new technical and maintenance positions and shifts labours into higher-skilled, creative roles.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:50:49.562Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that’s a clear, confident thesis and a strong step forward. Quick praise: you now make a definite claim and preview reasons, which gives the reader a roadmap. Well done.

A few short suggestions to consider (you can accept these or try a quick revision):
- Remove redundancy: “ultimately” and “in the long term” both mean the same thing; you only need one.
- Word choice: “labours” is not correct here — use “workers” or “employees.”
- Parallel structure: make the reasons match grammatically (e.g., “it creates…, and it shifts…”).
- Optional: add a third brief reason (e.g., productivity gains that create new demand) if you want a fuller roadmap.

Would you like to try one small revision now? If not, we can proceed with the thesis you just wrote.

Because you provided a revised thesis sentence, here is your full essay with that thesis inserted into the introduction exactly as you wrote it (so you can see how it fits):

Revised essay (thesis updated)
---
In recent years, automation is not an unfamiliar term for us. Employers use AI to perform routine tasks to reduce hiring costs and enhance efficiency. Automation is transforming industries, resulting in boost in technological industries. Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term because it creates new technical and maintenance positions and shifts labours into higher-skilled, creative roles.

Technological shift may result in creation of new jobs. For example, as we create and make more AI to help us complete repeated tasks, we need to employ more employees for AI maintenance or checking and verifying the quality of AI outcomes. Although AI is powerful, it cannot really act like a human and have human values, which depend on different situations, causing different actions and decisions that we make. AI cannot think like a human being and act like a human.

Technological transformation can speed up the entire process in manufactory by automation, freeing humans to focus on high-level tasks. Humans do not need to perform repeated tasks and AI will help us to finish it , allowing humans to focus on creativity, logical thinking and jobs that require empathy. AI just acts as a helper to speed up our work , enhancing efficiency but it cannot completely replace humans. Moreover, we can have more time for other jobs.

To conclude, automation may cause some job replacement, while it also creates more job opportunities for humans and speeds up the processes in jobs. It may lead to a brighter global employment prospects in long term.
---

Next decision before we move to Step 2
1) Are you satisfied with this thesis as it stands, or would you like to try a short revision now (pick one)?
- Satisfied — proceed to Step 2
- I want to revise the thesis now (I’ll try a short rewrite)

2) Which body paragraph do you want to revise with me in Steps 2–3?
- Paragraph 2 (the one about new jobs / AI maintenance)
- Paragraph 3 (the one about freeing humans for higher-level tasks)

3) Which 1–3 revision targets shall we focus on next? Pick up to three:
- Revise the chosen paragraph’s topic sentence to link to the thesis
- Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity, unity, and evidence
- Fix grammar and sentence-level errors in that paragraph
- Improve vocabulary/word choice in that paragraph

Tell me your choices (1–3). If you choose to revise the thesis now, paste your new version and I’ll give quick feedback before we start Step 2. If you’re ready to move on, tell me which paragraph and targets and we’ll work on the topic sentence next. Would you like to proceed?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:51:20.818Z

**You:** Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects  because it creates new technical and maintenance positions and shifts workers into higher-skilled, creative roles.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:52:25.463Z

**Assistant:** Nice — this is a clear, confident thesis and a great step forward. Well done.

A few brief, focused comments to tighten it (you can accept these or ignore them):
- Tone/time phrase: “ultimately” and “in the long term” mean the same thing. You only need one — if you want a tighter sentence, pick one and remove the other.
- Word choice/parallelism: your reasons read well and are parallel enough. If you want a fuller roadmap, consider adding a third reason (for example, productivity gains that create new demand), but two reasons is fine.
- Final read: check for small article/number issues when you move the thesis into your intro (e.g., “a boost in technological industries” → “a boost in the tech sector”).

Quick check — are you satisfied with the thesis exactly as you wrote it:
Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects because it creates new technical and maintenance positions and shifts workers into higher-skilled, creative roles.
- Yes — keep as is
- No — I want to revise it now (I’ll try a short rewrite)

Before we move to Step 2, please choose:
1) Which body paragraph would you like to revise with me? (pick one)
- Paragraph 2 (about new jobs / AI maintenance)
- Paragraph 3 (about automation freeing humans for higher-level tasks)

2) Which 1–3 revision targets shall we focus on in this session? (pick up to three)
- Revise the chosen paragraph’s topic sentence to link to the thesis
- Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity, unity, and evidence
- Fix grammar and sentence-level errors in that paragraph
- Improve vocabulary/word choice in that paragraph

Once you tell me (a) whether you’re satisfied with the thesis and (b) which paragraph and targets you choose, we’ll start Step 2 (work on the topic sentence). Would you like to proceed?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:52:41.713Z

**You:** Let's move to step 2. Make paragraph topic sentences and structure match the thesis

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:55:33.214Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s do Step 2. Quick check: your working thesis is
Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects because it creates new technical and maintenance positions and shifts workers into higher‑skilled, creative roles.

Which body paragraph would you like to work on with me now — paragraph 2 (new jobs / AI maintenance) or paragraph 3 (automation freeing humans for high‑level tasks)?

Before you pick, a very short diagnosis of each current topic sentence to help you choose:

- Paragraph 2 (current: "Technological shift may result in creation of new jobs.")
  - What’s good: It ties to the thesis idea that automation creates jobs.
  - What to improve: It’s weak and vague (uses “may” and “creation of new jobs”). To match the thesis, make it confident, specific (mention technical/maintenance roles), and preview the kind of evidence you will give (example of roles or tasks).

- Paragraph 3 (current: "Technological transformation can speed up the entire process in manufactory by automation, freeing humans to focus on high-level tasks.")
  - What’s good: It connects to the thesis idea of shifting workers into higher‑level work.
  - What to improve: Word choice and grammar need polishing (“manufactory” → “manufacturing,” remove “can” if thesis uses “will”), and it should explicitly link to “higher‑skilled, creative roles” from the thesis and preview the paragraph’s support (e.g., creativity, empathy, problem‑solving).

Which do you choose? Once you pick one paragraph:
1) Paste the current topic sentence (or tell me you want to keep the existing one).
2) Decide which revision targets to focus on for this paragraph (pick up to three: topic sentence link to thesis, clarity/coherence of paragraph content, grammar/sentence errors, vocabulary).
3) Would you like to try revising the topic sentence yourself now? (I’ll give feedback.) If you prefer, I can offer one or two very short model topic‑sentence options after you try.

Would you like to start with paragraph 2 or paragraph 3?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:55:58.430Z

**You:** Technological shift results in creation of maintenance and technical roles

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:59:32.136Z

**Assistant:** Good—thanks for sharing that topic sentence. Let’s strengthen it so it clearly links to your thesis and sets up the paragraph’s evidence.

1) Quick praise
- This sentence is on the right track: it ties directly to your thesis idea that automation creates jobs. Good focus.

2) What to improve (brief, specific)
- Confidence and wording: “results in creation of” is wordy and a bit weak. Use a stronger verb (e.g., “creates,” “generates”).
- Parallel to thesis: your thesis says “technical and maintenance positions” and “higher‑skilled, creative roles.” The topic sentence should echo the thesis language so the reader sees the connection immediately.
- Preview/evidence: a strong topic sentence often hints at the kind of example or evidence you will give (e.g., AI technicians, quality‑control specialists, data annotators).
- Grammar/style: consider ordering (“technical and maintenance roles” reads better than “maintenance and technical roles”) and make it an active sentence.

3) A short template to try (fill in the brackets)
- “First, automation [strong verb] new [types of roles], such as [brief example].”

4) Would you like to try rewriting it now?
- Please try one short revised topic sentence here. I’ll give quick feedback.

5) If you want a model to adapt, here are two very short options you can copy or change (only if you’d like an example):
- “Automation creates new technical and maintenance roles, such as AI technicians and systems auditors.”
- “First, automation generates technical and maintenance positions that are essential for developing, monitoring, and repairing AI systems.”

Which do you prefer: (A) you’ll try a revision now, or (B) you want to adapt one of the model sentences above? Also confirm which revision targets for this paragraph you want to focus on next (pick up to three): link topic sentence to thesis / revise paragraph content for clarity & evidence / fix grammar & vocabulary.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T12:59:50.466Z

**You:** First, automation creates new technical and maintenance positions, such as maintaining automated machines to ensure they function properly.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:03:57.880Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that topic sentence is on the right track: it directly supports your thesis and signals the paragraph’s focus on jobs created by automation. A few quick, focused notes to make it stronger, then we’ll move to revising the rest of the paragraph.

Feedback on your topic sentence
- Praise: It’s clear and connects to the thesis idea that automation creates jobs. Good use of “First,” to mark the paragraph’s place in your argument.
- What to improve (brief):
  - Grammar/phrase mismatch: “such as maintaining automated machines to ensure they function properly” describes an action (maintaining) rather than naming the positions that are created. Topic sentences should list roles or functions (e.g., “AI technicians,” “maintenance engineers”), not tasks.
  - Concision and formality: Replace “positions, such as maintaining…” with a noun phrase: “positions, such as X and Y, who do Z.”
  - Link more clearly to thesis language: echo “technical and maintenance positions” or “technical and maintenance roles” to show the paragraph develops the thesis.

Would you like to try a quick revision of that sentence now? If you want a short example to adapt, here is a model phrase you can use (only to adapt — try to write your own first):
- Example phrase to adapt: “First, automation creates technical and maintenance roles, such as AI technicians and maintenance engineers who ensure automated systems function properly.”

Because you provided a specific edit, here is your full essay with your topic sentence inserted exactly as you wrote it so you can see how it fits:

In recent years, automation is not an unfamiliar term for us. Employers use AI to perform routine tasks to reduce hiring costs and enhance efficiency. Automation is transforming industries, resulting in boost in technological industries. Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term because it creates new technical and maintenance positions and shifts workers into higher-skilled, creative roles.

First, automation creates new technical and maintenance positions, such as maintaining automated machines to ensure they function properly. For example, as we create and make more AI to help us complete repeated tasks, we need to employ more employees for AI maintenance or checking and verifying the quality of AI outcomes. Although AI is powerful, it cannot really act like a human and have human values, which depend on different situations, causing different actions and decisions that we make. AI cannot think like a human being and act like a human.

Technological transformation can speed up the entire process in manufactory by automation, freeing humans to focus on high-level tasks.

To conclude, automation may cause some job replacement, while it also creates more job opportunities for humans and speeds up the processes in jobs. It may lead to a brighter global employment prospects in long term.
---

Step 3 — Revising the rest of this paragraph (focused, guided work)
Now let’s revise the supporting sentences in paragraph 2 so they clearly develop the topic sentence, show unity, and fix grammar/word choice.

What to change in the paragraph (specific, actionable):
1. Make the evidence match the topic sentence. Right now the topic sentence names positions but the support mostly describes tasks and repeats that “AI cannot be human.” Rework the support to show how those jobs arise (examples of roles, responsibilities, and why humans are needed).
2. Improve clarity and concision:
   - “create and make more AI” → choose one verb: “develop” or “create.”
   - “need to employ more employees” → “need to hire more workers/staff” or “create new jobs.”
   - “checking and verifying the quality of AI outcomes” → “monitoring AI outputs” or “quality‑assurance roles.”
3. Reduce repetition about “AI cannot think like a human.” Keep one clear sentence explaining why human oversight is required (judgment, ethics, context).
4. Fix grammar and word choice: “manufactory” → “manufacturing” (later paragraph), spacing before commas, “labours” → “workers” etc.

Guiding questions to help you revise each sentence
- Does this sentence name or describe a position that follows from automation?
- Does it explain why human workers are needed (skill, judgement, ethics, maintenance)?
- Can any wordy phrases be tightened?
- Is there an example or brief evidence that makes the claim believable (a job title, a task, or a short hypothetical)?

Suggested small edits and phrases you can use (not full rewrites — adapt them):
- Instead of “we create and make more AI,” try “as companies develop more AI systems…”
- Replace “employ more employees” with “hire technicians, systems auditors, and maintenance staff.”
- Replace “checking and verifying the quality of AI outcomes” with “monitoring outputs and performing quality assurance.”
- For the sentence about AI not being human, try a concise explanation: “Because AI lacks human judgment and ethical reasoning, people are needed to interpret results and make context‑sensitive decisions.”

Your turn — two short tasks
1) Would you like to try revising the first supporting sentence now (the one that begins “For example, as we create and make more AI…”)? Try one or two sentences that:
   - Use tighter verbs (develop/hire/monitor),
   - Name 1–3 specific roles,
   - Show how those roles follow from automation.

2) After you post that revised supporting sentence, I’ll give quick targeted feedback and then we’ll revise the remaining sentences in the paragraph (sentence about AI not being human, and any linking sentence). Which revision targets do you want me to focus on for this paragraph? (Pick up to three)
- Link topic sentence to thesis
- Revise paragraph content for clarity & evidence
- Fix grammar & sentence-level errors
- Improve vocabulary/word choice

Would you like to try rewriting that first supporting sentence now?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:04:45.895Z

**You:** First, automation creates new technical and maintenance positions, such as AI technicians and maintenance engineers.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:11:25.596Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that revised topic/support sentence is much stronger: it’s confident, specific, and links clearly to your thesis. Well done.

A couple of very small suggestions (you don’t have to change these now):
- It’s good to name roles. You could optionally add a short phrase about what those roles do (e.g., “to monitor and repair systems”), but the sentence is fine as is.
- Keep plural nouns consistent: “positions” and the examples (“AI technicians and maintenance engineers”) read well.

Because you replaced that sentence, here is your full essay with your exact sentence inserted so you can see how it fits:

Next step — revise the rest of paragraph 2 (guided, short tasks)
I suggest we now focus on these three small goals for this paragraph:
- Make the supporting sentences directly develop the topic sentence (explain how and why those roles are needed).
- Replace wordy/repetitive phrases and fix grammar.
- Keep one clear sentence explaining why humans (judgment/ethics/context) are required.

Quick hints and useful short phrases you can adapt (not full rewrites):
- Replace “create and make more AI” → “develop more AI systems”
- Replace “need to employ more employees” → “need to hire technicians, quality‑assurance staff, and maintenance engineers”
- Replace “checking and verifying the quality of AI outcomes” → “monitoring outputs and performing quality assurance”
- For the human‑judgment point, try a short model phrase to adapt: “Because AI lacks human judgment and ethical reasoning, people are needed to interpret results and make context‑sensitive decisions.”

Your turn (two short, simple tasks)
1) Please try rewriting the next supporting sentence (the one that starts “For example, as we create and make more AI…”). Aim for 1–2 sentences that:
   - Use one tighter verb (develop/hire/monitor),
   - Name 1–3 specific roles or tasks,
   - Show briefly why those roles are needed.

2) Also tell me which revision targets I should focus on while giving feedback (pick up to three):
- Link topic sentence to thesis
- Revise paragraph content for clarity & evidence
- Fix grammar & sentence-level errors
- Improve vocabulary/word choice

Paste your revised sentence(s) here when you’re ready, and I’ll give quick, focused feedback and then help you polish the remaining lines in the paragraph. Would you like to try that now?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T13:11:46.075Z

**You:** Technological transformation can speed up the entire process in manufacturing by automation, freeing humans to focus on high-level tasks.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:10:29.145Z

**Assistant:** Nice—good sentence to work from. Quick praise: it communicates the main idea (automation speeds manufacturing and lets humans do higher-level work). Let’s tighten it so it links clearly to your thesis (which says automation shifts workers into higher‑skilled, creative roles), improves formality, and fixes small wording issues.

Brief, focused feedback
- Verb strength: “can speed up” is weak. Use a stronger verb to match your confident thesis (e.g., “speeds up” or “will speed up”).
- Word order & phrasing: “the entire process in manufacturing” is wordy; “the manufacturing process” is clearer.
- Preposition: “by automation” is awkward; “through automation” or “via automation” works better.
- Subject choice: “humans” is okay but “workers” or “employees” is more academic and matches your thesis language.
- Link to thesis: echo “higher‑skilled, creative roles” (or “higher‑level, creative tasks”) so the paragraph clearly develops the thesis.

Micro‑editing template (use this to build your revision)
- [Strong verb] + the manufacturing process + through/via automation, freeing + workers/employees + to focus on + [higher‑skilled/creative tasks or roles].

Short word/phrase swaps you can copy into your sentence
- “can speed up” → “speeds up” / “will speed up”
- “the entire process in manufacturing” → “the manufacturing process”
- “by automation” → “through automation” / “via automation”
- “freeing humans” → “freeing workers” / “allowing employees”
- add: “to focus on higher‑skilled, creative tasks such as …” (then name 1–2 examples: design, problem‑solving, customer relations)

Would you like to try rewriting the sentence now using that template? Paste your revised version here and tell me which of these targets you want me to focus on when I give feedback:
- Link topic sentence to thesis
- Improve clarity & concision
- Fix grammar & word choice

Try one short revision and I’ll give quick, focused feedback.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:10:54.806Z

**You:** Technological transformation can speed up the entire process in manufacturing by automation, freeing humans to focus on high-level tasks.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:12:00.618Z

**Assistant:** Nice—this is a clear idea and connects to your thesis. Well done.

A few quick, focused suggestions to tighten it:
- Stronger verb: replace weak “can speed up” with “speeds up” (or “will speed up” if you want to match the confident tone of your thesis).
- Clearer phrase: use “the manufacturing process” instead of “the entire process in manufacturing.”
- Preposition: “through automation” or “via automation” reads better than “by automation.”
- More academic noun: use “workers” or “employees” instead of “humans.”
- Link to thesis and be specific: echo “higher‑skilled, creative roles” and give 1–2 brief examples (e.g., design, problem‑solving, customer relations).

Use this short template to try a revision (fill the brackets, don’t copy the whole sentence unless you want to):
- “[Strong verb] the manufacturing process [through/via automation], freeing [workers/employees] to focus on [higher‑skilled, creative tasks such as ___].”

Would you like to try rewriting that sentence now? Tell me also which of these I should focus on when I give feedback:
- Link topic sentence to thesis
- Improve clarity & concision
- Fix grammar & word choice

Try one revised sentence and I’ll give quick, targeted feedback.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:12:14.576Z

**You:** Second, speeding up the manufacturing process via automation allow employees to focus on high-skilled, creative tasks such as design and problem-solving

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:15:27.925Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that sentence clearly connects to your thesis and gives concrete examples. Good choice of focus.

Two quick, focused corrections you should consider:
- Subject–verb agreement: use allows (singular) not allow. Example: “speeding up … allows …”
- Word choice: “highly skilled” is more natural than “high‑skilled.”
- Optional improvement: echo your thesis language (“shift into higher‑skilled, creative roles”) if you want an even clearer link.

If you want a model to adapt, here are two short options (use one to revise your sentence or combine ideas):
- Minimal fix: “Second, speeding up the manufacturing process via automation allows employees to focus on highly skilled, creative tasks such as design and problem‑solving.”
- Stronger, thesis‑linking version: “Second, automation speeds up the manufacturing process and allows workers to shift into higher‑skilled, creative roles such as product design and strategic problem‑solving.”

Would you like to:
- Try one of the model revisions yourself now (paste your new sentence), or
- Ask me to focus on polishing grammar and word choice for this sentence, OR
- Move on to revising the next supporting sentence in paragraph 3 (I can prompt you with a targeted question)?

Pick one small step and I’ll guide you.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:15:54.679Z

**You:** Second, speeding up the manufacturing process via automation allows employees to shift into high-skilled, creative roles such as product design and strategic problem-solving

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:19:05.958Z

**Assistant:** Nice — that topic sentence is clear and focused. Good job connecting the paragraph to your thesis and giving concrete examples (product design; problem‑solving).

Two very quick points to consider (you can accept or ignore them when you revise the rest of the paragraph):
- Word choice: use "higher‑skilled" or "highly skilled" rather than "high‑skilled." (This is a small grammar/wording fix.)
- Punctuation/finish: add a period at the end of the sentence.

Because you made a specific edit, here is the full essay with your topic sentence for paragraph 3 inserted exactly as you wrote it so you can see how it fits:

Although AI is powerful, it cannot really act like a human and have human values, which depend on different situations, causing different actions and decisions that we make. AI cannot think like a human being and act like a human.

Second, speeding up the manufacturing process via automation allows employees to shift into high-skilled, creative roles such as product design and strategic problem-solving

Technological transformation can speed up the entire process in manufactory by automation, freeing humans to focus on high-level tasks. Humans do not need to perform repeated tasks and AI will help us to finish it , allowing humans to focus on creativity, logical thinking and jobs that require empathy. AI just acts as a helper to speed up our work , enhancing efficiency but it cannot completely replace humans. Moreover, we can have more time for other jobs.

To conclude, automation may cause some job replacement, while it also creates more job opportunities for humans and speeds up the processes in jobs. It may lead to a brighter global employment prospects in long term.

Step 3 — revise the rest of paragraph 3 (next focused moves)
Goal for this step: make the supporting sentences in paragraph 3 clearly develop your topic sentence, improve unity and clarity, and fix grammar/wording problems.

What to fix in the paragraph (short, actionable):
- Remove repetition and redundancy (the paragraph repeats ideas already in paragraph 2).
- Make each supporting sentence clearly explain HOW automation lets workers move into higher‑skilled roles (give one brief example or explain the mechanism).
- Fix grammar and word choice (manufacturing, allows/allow, punctuation, “human” → “workers/employees,” “high‑skilled” → “higher‑skilled” or “highly skilled”).
- Keep one concise sentence about why some routine jobs decline, but frame it as a shift rather than a repetition of “AI cannot be human.”

Guiding questions to help you revise:
- Does each sentence in this paragraph directly support the topic sentence about shifting workers into higher‑skilled, creative roles?
- Do you give a short example or explanation of what those roles involve and why humans are needed?
- Can any sentence be shortened or combined to avoid repetition?

Helpful short phrases you may adapt (not full rewrites — use them to build your sentences):
- “Because automation handles routine, repetitive tasks, workers can focus on …”
- “This shift allows employees to take on roles such as … which require …”
- “Human oversight remains essential for … (ethical judgments, contextual decisions, complex problem‑solving).”

Your next (small) task — try one of these:
A) Revise the sentence that now follows your topic sentence (the one that begins “Technological transformation can speed up…”). Aim for 1–2 sentences that:
   - Use a stronger verb (speeds up / allows / enables),
   - Echo the thesis language (higher‑skilled, creative roles),
   - Give one or two brief examples or explain WHAT those roles do.

OR

B) If you prefer, paste the next 1–2 sentences you want to change and tell me which of these targets to focus on:
   - Link paragraph to thesis
   - Improve clarity & concision
   - Fix grammar & word choice

Would you like to try revising that next supporting sentence now? Paste your attempt here and I’ll give quick, focused feedback and one micro‑suggestion to polish it.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:19:53.546Z

**You:** Let's move to step 3. Revise paragraph 2

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:23:02.743Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s do Step 3 for paragraph 2. Quick praise first: you’ve already made a strong topic sentence for that paragraph (it names AI technicians and maintenance engineers). Now we’ll tighten the supporting sentences so they directly develop that idea, improve clarity, and fix grammar.

Two short goals for this step
1) Turn the current supporting sentences into clear, specific evidence that shows HOW and WHY those roles are created.  
2) Remove repetition about “AI cannot be human” and replace it with one concise sentence explaining why human oversight (judgement, ethics, context) is needed.

What I want you to try now (two small tasks)
A) Revise the sentence that begins “For example, as we create and make more AI…” Try 1–2 sentences that:
   - Use one tighter verb (develop, deploy, or create),
   - Name 1–3 specific roles (technicians, quality‑assurance staff, systems auditors),
   - Explain briefly what those roles do (monitor systems, repair hardware, check outputs).

Helpful short phrase pieces you can use or adapt (not full rewrites — please write your own sentence):
- “as companies develop more AI systems, they must hire …”
- “to monitor outputs and perform quality assurance”
- “for system maintenance and repair”

B) Rewrite the sentence(s) that explain why humans are still needed (the “AI cannot act like a human…” part). Aim for one concise sentence that:
   - Focuses on judgement, ethics, or contextual decision‑making,
   - Uses formal, clear language (e.g., “Because AI lacks human judgment and ethical reasoning, …”).

Helpful short phrase pieces for that:
- “AI lacks human judgment and ethical reasoning”
- “people are needed to interpret results and make context‑sensitive decisions”
- “human oversight is essential for decisions that require empathy or moral judgement”

Choose which revision targets you want me to focus on when I give feedback (pick up to three):
- Link paragraph to thesis
- Revise paragraph content for clarity & evidence
- Fix grammar & sentence‑level errors
- Improve vocabulary/word choice

Would you like to try rewriting A and B now? Paste your 1–3 revised sentences for paragraph 2 here and I’ll give quick, focused feedback. After you post them and we polish, I’ll insert them into the full essay and show you the updated version. Nice work so far — you’re almost there.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:23:25.606Z

**You:** As companies develop more AI systems to complete routine tasks, they must hire more employees to maintain automated machines to ensure they function properly or to monitor outcomes and guarantee their quality that meets requirements. AI lacks human judgment and ethical reasoning, and therefore humans are still needed to interpret results and make context‑sensitive decisions.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:39:45.066Z

**Assistant:** Well done — these two sentences clearly develop the paragraph’s main idea and show real improvement: they name why new roles appear and explain why humans remain necessary. Nice work.

Quick, focused feedback (three small points)
1. Make the first sentence clearer and less long: it currently bundles several ideas (hiring, maintenance, monitoring, quality) in one long clause. Consider splitting it or tightening phrases (e.g., “hire technicians and quality‑assurance staff” instead of “hire more employees to maintain automated machines…”).
2. Word choices to consider: “automated machines” → “automated systems”; “hire more employees” → “hire technicians/maintenance staff”; “guarantee their quality that meets requirements” → “ensure outputs meet standards” or “ensure output quality.”
3. The second sentence is strong; you could tighten it slightly for flow (start with “Because AI lacks…”). Either way it already explains the reasoning well.

Would you like to try a tiny revision of the first sentence now (one shorter sentence), or shall I show one very short model you can adapt? (I won’t give a full paragraph rewrite unless you ask.)

Because you made these edits, here is your full essay with your two revised sentences inserted exactly as you wrote them so you can see the paragraph in context:

---
In recent years, automation is not an unfamiliar term for us. Employers use AI to perform routine tasks to reduce hiring costs and enhance efficiency. Automation is transforming industries, resulting in boost in technological industries. Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term because it creates new technical and maintenance positions and shifts workers into higher-skilled, creative roles.

Next step — what would you like to do now? Pick one:
- I’ll try a short tightening of that long first sentence (I’ll post it); please give feedback.
- Yes — show me one very short model sentence to adapt.
- Move on to revising paragraph 3 (topic sentence or supporting sentences).
- Focus on grammar and vocabulary across the essay (but note our scope focuses on the thesis and one paragraph).

Which do you choose?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:40:17.621Z

**You:** As companies develop more AI systems to complete routine tasks, they must hire technicians and quality-assurance staff to ensure output that meets standards. AI lacks human judgment and ethical reasoning, and therefore humans are still needed to interpret results and make context‑sensitive decisions.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:44:03.731Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — these two sentences are clear, focused, and they tighten the paragraph by naming roles and explaining why humans remain necessary. Well done.

Two tiny, optional suggestions you can consider (only if you want to polish further):
- In the first sentence, use the plural “outputs” or add “quality” for clarity: “ensure outputs meet standards” or “ensure output quality meets standards.”
- The second sentence is fine; if you want a slightly crisper connection, you could start with “Because AI lacks…” instead of “AI lacks… and therefore…,” but this is optional.

Because you made a concrete edit, here is the full essay with your two sentences inserted exactly as you wrote them so you can see the paragraph in context:

Next step — what would you like to do now? Pick one small, clear option and I’ll guide you:
1) Polish paragraph 2 further (I can prompt one micro-edit for you to try), focusing on clarity, vocabulary, or grammar.
2) Move to paragraph 3 (revise its topic sentence or supporting sentences) — pick which sentence to work on.
3) Refine the thesis sentence (make it tighter/parallel or add a third reason).

Also tell me which 1–3 revision targets to focus on next (choose from: link topic sentence to thesis / revise paragraph content for clarity & evidence / fix grammar & sentence-level errors / improve vocabulary). Would you like to proceed with option 1, 2, or 3?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:44:48.681Z

AI lacks human judgment and ethical reasoning, and therefore humans are still needed to interpret results and make context‑sensitive decisions.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:46:49.546Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — these two sentences are clear, specific, and directly support your topic sentence. Well done.

A few tiny, focused suggestions (you can accept or ignore any):
- Consider “ensure outputs meet quality standards” or “ensure output quality meets standards” for slightly smoother phrasing.
- Hyphenate “context‑sensitive” (you already used this correctly with a nonbreaking hyphen earlier — maintain consistency).
- If you want stronger flow, start the second sentence with “Because AI lacks…” to show the causal link more clearly: “Because AI lacks human judgment and ethical reasoning, people are needed …” (optional).

I’ve inserted your exact two sentences into the essay below so you can see how the paragraph looks in context.

What would you like to do next? Pick one:
1) Polish paragraph 2 further (I can suggest 1–2 micro‑edits for wording/grammar),  
2) Move to paragraph 3 (revise its supporting sentences to match your thesis), or  
3) Refine the thesis (tighten wording/parallelism or add a third reason).

Also tell me which 1–3 revision targets to focus on next (choose up to three): link paragraph to thesis / revise paragraph content for clarity & evidence / fix grammar & sentence‑level errors / improve vocabulary. Which do you choose?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:47:15.510Z

**You:** improve vocabulary

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:48:42.547Z

**Assistant:** Great — improving vocabulary is a useful, focused goal. Before we begin, a quick check so we stay aligned:

1) Confirm targets and scope
- Do you want to improve vocabulary in:
  - Paragraph 2 (the one about new technical/maintenance jobs)? — recommended
  - Paragraph 3 (shifting to higher‑skilled roles)?
- Also confirm: I’ll only help revise the thesis (if you want), one paragraph’s topic sentence, and that paragraph’s supporting sentences. Which paragraph do you choose?

2) Quick thesis check (one sentence)
- Please paste your current thesis here or say “keep current thesis.” (We already worked on this: “Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects because it creates new technical and maintenance positions and shifts workers into higher‑skilled, creative roles.”) Do you want to keep it as is?

3) Vocabulary targets (pick up to three)
- Replace informal/repetitive words (e.g., “employ more employees,” “create and make more”)
- Use precise academic verbs and nouns (e.g., “hire technicians,” “monitor outputs,” “ensure output quality”)
- Use collocations and stronger adjectives (e.g., “tech sector,” “highly skilled,” “quality‑assurance”)
Tell me which of the above you want to focus on.

Now, a few short vocabulary suggestions you can use (not full sentence rewrites — adapt them):

- Replace weak verbs:
  - “create/make” → develop, produce, generate, lead to the creation of
  - “use AI to perform” → deploy AI to automate/automate routine tasks with AI
  - “speed up” → accelerate, streamline, increase the efficiency of

- Replace informal/repetitive nouns:
  - “employees / employ more employees” → hire technicians, recruit maintenance staff, create new roles/personnel
  - “manufactory” → manufacturing
  - “labours” → workers, employees, the workforce

- Precision for job titles & tasks:
  - “checking and verifying the quality of AI outcomes” → monitoring AI outputs, performing quality assurance, systems auditing
  - “maintain automated machines” → maintain automated systems, perform system maintenance and troubleshooting

- Stronger adjectives and collocations:
  - “high-skilled” → highly skilled / higher‑skilled
  - “tech sector” or “technology sector” instead of “technological industries”
  - “in the long term” (use one phrase, not both “ultimately” and “in the long term”)

- Academic phrasing for reasons:
  - “AI cannot think like a human” → “AI lacks human judgment and ethical reasoning” or “AI cannot replicate human contextual judgement and empathy”

Next step (interactive — please try one)
- Please pick one small sentence to rewrite now using stronger vocabulary. Options:
  1) The paragraph‑2 topic sentence (current: “First, automation creates new technical and maintenance positions, such as AI technicians and maintenance engineers.”) — try improving vocabulary there.
  2) A supporting sentence in paragraph 2 (for example: “As companies develop more AI systems to complete routine tasks, they must hire technicians to maintain systems and quality‑assurance staff to ensure outputs meet standards.”) — try improving word choice and phrasing.
- Write your revised sentence here (short — 1 sentence). I’ll give very focused feedback and suggest 2–3 alternative words or phrases if you’d like.

Would you like to work on the topic sentence or a supporting sentence? Which of the vocabulary targets above do you want me to focus on when I give feedback?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:49:08.880Z

**You:** How to make the paragraph 2 longer after revising it? Now, the paragraph is a little bit short

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:52:51.781Z

**Assistant:** Good question — that’s a smart next step. Your paragraph is focused and clear but a bit short for a full development. Here are practical, teacher‑style steps you can use to expand it while keeping unity and linking tightly to your thesis.

Quick plan (add 2–4 short sentences)
- Add 1 concrete example (a job title + specific task + context).
- Add 1 explanation of the causal mechanism (why that job is needed).
- Optionally add 1 piece of evidence or a brief concession/refutation.
- Finish with 1 short linking sentence that ties the paragraph back to the thesis.

What to include (with short templates you can adapt)
- Concrete example (fill the brackets): For example, in [industry], firms hire [job title] to [specific task]…
- Explain the mechanism (brief fragment): This role is needed because automated systems require [maintenance/monitoring/ethical review] that only humans can provide…
- Evidence or authority (prompt to fill): According to [report/study/company], [brief statistic or finding]… (If you don’t have a source, say “recent studies show…” and then look up one later.)
- Concession + quick refutation (optional): Although automation displaces some routine jobs, [short rebuttal that shows creation of new roles or reskilling opportunities]…
- Link back to thesis (wrap up): Together, these developments show that automation not only displaces tasks but also creates technical and maintenance roles that support the claim in the thesis…

How to turn those into 2–4 sentences (workable order)
- Sentence A: Example naming roles and one concrete task. (1 sentence)
- Sentence B: Short explanation of why the role exists — the causal mechanism. (1 sentence)
- Sentence C (optional): A sentence with evidence or a brief concession/refutation. (1 sentence)
- Sentence D: A linking sentence that explicitly connects back to your thesis roadmap. (1 sentence)

Micro‑editing tips while you expand
- Use stronger verbs: develop, deploy, hire, monitor, maintain, troubleshoot.
- Use precise nouns: “technicians,” “quality‑assurance staff,” “systems auditors,” “maintenance engineers.”
- Avoid repetition: don’t restate “AI cannot be human” more than once — replace repeated ideas with specific functions.
- Keep one clear pronoun reference (e.g., “these roles,” “such staff”) so the paragraph reads smoothly.
- Vary sentence length: one shorter sentence (the link back) helps readability.

Two short starter fragments you can adapt (fill the brackets)
- “For example, in [automotive/manufacturing/tech], companies hire [AI technician/maintenance engineer/quality‑assurance specialist] to [monitor system outputs, repair equipment, and update models]…”
- “Because AI lacks [contextual judgment/ethical reasoning], human workers are required to [interpret ambiguous outputs, make ethical choices, or apply domain knowledge]…”
(These are fragments — turn each into 1 short full sentence in your own words.)

Next step (interactive)
Would you like to try adding 2 sentences now? Try:
- One concrete example sentence (use the first fragment), and
- One causal/explanatory sentence (use the second fragment).

Paste them here and I’ll give focused feedback on content, cohesion, and vocabulary. You’re doing well — just a small expansion will make the paragraph feel complete and stronger.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:53:15.253Z

**You:** As companies develop more AI systems to complete routine tasks, they must hire technicians to maintain systems and quality-assurance staff to ensure outputs meet standards.

Together, these developments show that automation not only displaces tasks but also creates technical and maintenance roles that support the claim in the thesis.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T14:58:00.910Z

**Assistant:** Great work — these new sentences make paragraph 2 much clearer and more academic. Quick praise first: you named specific roles (technicians, quality‑assurance staff), explained why they are needed, and added a linking sentence that ties the paragraph back to the thesis. That is exactly what this paragraph needed.

Brief, focused feedback (one-sentence points)
- First sentence: Strong idea and vocabulary. Consider swapping “develop” for “deploy” if you want to emphasize companies using AI now (deploy AI systems to automate routine tasks). Also you could split it into two shorter sentences if it feels long.
- Second sentence: Clear explanation. If you want crisper cause–effect flow, start with “Because AI lacks human judgment and ethical reasoning, …” (optional).
- Linking sentence: It does the job. A slightly shorter phrasing (e.g., “support the thesis”) would be more direct, but your sentence is acceptable.

Because you provided these edits, here is your full essay with your three revised sentences inserted in paragraph 2 exactly as you wrote them so you can see how it fits in context:

Next small choices — what would you like to do now? Pick one (I’ll guide you in that direction):
1) Tighten vocabulary and grammar in paragraph 2 (I’ll suggest 1–3 micro‑edits and you try them), or
2) Move to paragraph 3 and revise its topic sentence/supporting sentences to match the thesis, or
3) Refine the thesis (e.g., tighten wording/parallelism or add a third reason).

Also tell me which revision targets to focus on next (pick up to three): link paragraph to thesis / revise paragraph content for clarity & evidence / fix grammar & sentence‑level errors / improve vocabulary.

Would you like to try a micro‑edit now (and if so, which sentence — 1st, 2nd, or linking sentence)?

**Assistant:** Well done — these three sentences are clear, specific, and they strengthen paragraph 2 by naming roles, explaining why those roles are needed, and tying the paragraph back to your thesis. I made only two very small copy‑edits for grammar/flow (removed an extra space in “interpret results” and began the third sentence with “Because AI lacks…” so the causal link is clearer). I kept everything else in your essay exactly as it was.

Here is your full essay with your revised paragraph 2 inserted:

Next small choices — what would you like to do now? (Pick one)
1) Move to paragraph 3: revise its topic sentence and/or supporting sentences to match your thesis (we can follow the same Step 2–3 process).  
2) Polish paragraph 2 further for vocabulary and grammar (micro‑edits only).  
3) Refine the thesis for tighter wording or add a third reason.

Also tell me which 1–3 revision targets to focus on next (pick up to three): link paragraph to thesis / revise content for clarity & evidence / fix grammar & sentence‑level errors / improve vocabulary.

Which option and targets do you choose?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T15:01:19.196Z

**You:** Let's move to step 3 - revise paragraph 3

*Time:* 2025-12-03T15:02:04.259Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing paragraph 3. Quick plan: before I help revise the paragraph’s supporting sentences (Step 3), we need to make sure the topic sentence clearly links to your thesis (Step 2). Then we’ll revise the rest of the paragraph for clarity, unity, and grammar.

1) Confirm revision targets for paragraph 3 (pick up to three)
- Revise topic sentence to link to the thesis
- Revise the rest of the paragraph for clarity & evidence
- Fix grammar & sentence-level errors
- Improve vocabulary/word choice
Which of these do you want me to focus on?

2) Brief, focused diagnosis of the current paragraph 3
- Strengths: The idea is relevant to your thesis (automation shifts workers into higher‑level roles) and you give examples (design, problem‑solving).
- Main issues: small grammar/word‑choice problems (e.g., “high‑skilled” → “highly skilled” or “higher‑skilled”; missing period); one sentence duplicates earlier ideas and could be tightened; the paragraph needs clearer explanation of how automation causes the shift (mechanism) and a concise linking sentence back to the thesis.

3) Topic sentence check (Step 2)
Your current topic sentence (as you wrote it earlier):
Second, speeding up the manufacturing process via automation allows employees to shift into high-skilled, creative roles such as product design and strategic problem-solving

Quick feedback (short):
- Use “higher‑skilled” or “highly skilled” instead of “high‑skilled.”
- Add punctuation (period).
- Consider echoing the thesis wording exactly (“shift workers into higher‑skilled, creative roles”) so the connection is obvious.
- You can strengthen the verb (“allows” is fine; “enables” or “permits” are other options).

Would you like to:
A) Try rewriting that topic sentence now? (I’ll give quick feedback.) — I recommend this.
B) Ask me to propose 1–2 very short model sentences you can adapt?

4) After we fix the topic sentence
I’ll guide you to revise the supporting sentences with 2 short tasks:
- Make 1 sentence explain the mechanism (how automation frees workers and what skills are needed).
- Make 1 sentence give a concrete example (a role + task) or a brief concession (acknowledge displacement, then refute).

Which option for the topic sentence do you choose (A or B)? If A, paste your revised topic sentence here and I’ll respond with brief, focused feedback so we can move to revising the paragraph’s support.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T15:02:24.620Z

**You:** The topic sentence has already revised: Second, speeding up the manufacturing process via automation allows employees to shift into higher-skilled, creative roles such as product design and strategic problem-solving. 

Moving to revise the paragraph is ok.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T15:05:39.940Z

**Assistant:** Nice—good choice and well done on the topic sentence. Quick praise: it links clearly to your thesis and gives concrete examples (product design; strategic problem‑solving). Just add the final punctuation (a period) and you’re ready to revise the rest of the paragraph.

Before we revise the supporting sentences, please confirm which 1–3 revision targets you want me to focus on for paragraph 3:
- Revise paragraph content for clarity & evidence
- Fix grammar & sentence‑level errors
- Improve vocabulary/word choice
(You can pick up to three.)

Now, Step 3 — revise the rest of paragraph 3
I want you to try one short revision now (this keeps the work interactive). Choose one of these options and paste your revision here (1–2 sentences):

Option A — Revise the next supporting sentence (recommended)
- Current idea to replace: “Technological transformation can speed up the entire process in manufactory by automation, freeing humans to focus on high-level tasks. Humans do not need to perform repeated tasks and AI will help us to finish it , allowing humans to focus on creativity, logical thinking and jobs that require empathy. AI just acts as a helper to speed up our work , enhancing efficiency but it cannot completely replace humans. Moreover, we can have more time for other jobs.”
- Task: Write 1–2 sentences that explain HOW automation frees workers for higher‑skilled roles and give one brief example of such a role (use stronger verbs and vocabulary). Keep it concise.

Guiding questions to help you write:
- What exactly does automation do to routine tasks (words: automate, streamline, accelerate, handle repetitive processes)?
- How does that change workers’ duties (words: allows workers to focus on, enables employees to move into, shifts staff toward)?
- Give one short example: name a role or task (e.g., product designer, systems analyst, customer experience manager) and say what that role requires (creativity, problem‑solving, empathy).

Short phrase bank (use any in your sentence):
- “automation streamlines routine production tasks”
- “enables workers to focus on higher‑skilled, creative tasks”
- “such as product design and strategic problem‑solving”
- “requires creativity, domain knowledge and interpersonal skills”

Option B — If you prefer, rewrite two very short supporting sentences:
1) One sentence explaining the mechanism (how automation frees employees).
2) One sentence giving a short example and why human skills matter.

Try one of these now and paste it here. I’ll give quick feedback and then insert your polished sentences into the full essay so you can see the updated version. Would you like to try Option A or B?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T15:06:05.405Z

**You:** As automation streamlines routine production tasks, which frees employees from time-consuming, repetitive tasks, humans is allowed to focus on creativity, logical thinking and jobs that require empathy. For example, creativity is more important than completing routine tasks. It is because it drives innovation and problem-solving by encouraging new ideas and produces and services, ensuring employees to be competitive, which contribute to company progress.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T15:23:51.451Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — you’ve moved paragraph 3 in the right direction by explaining the mechanism (automation frees workers) and trying to justify why creativity matters. I’ll give focused feedback on each sentence, a few short phrase suggestions you can use to revise, then I’ll paste the full essay with your sentences inserted exactly as you wrote them so you can see the context.

Brief feedback (sentence by sentence)
1) “As automation streamlines routine production tasks, which frees employees from time-consuming, repetitive tasks, humans is allowed to focus on creativity, logical thinking and jobs that require empathy.”
- Problems: redundant clause structure (“As… which…”), subject–verb error (“humans is”), and uneven parallelism (mixing abilities and job types).
- Quick fixes to try: remove the extra relative clause, use a better subject (“workers”/“employees”), and make the list parallel.
- Short phrase options you can insert/adapt:
  - Replace “As automation streamlines…” with “As automation streamlines routine production tasks, it allows workers to…”
  - Replace “humans is allowed to focus on” with “workers to focus on” or “workers can focus on”
  - For the list: “higher‑skilled, creative, and interpersonal tasks that require empathy and judgment.”

2) “For example, creativity is more important than completing routine tasks.”
- Problems: True but too general and a little abrupt; it could connect more clearly to the previous sentence and the paragraph’s examples.
- Quick fix: add a short phrase to link this to the kinds of roles (e.g., “For example, creative skills matter more than routine task performance in roles such as …”).

3) “It is because it drives innovation and problem-solving by encouraging new ideas and produces and services, ensuring employees to be competitive, which contribute to company progress.”
- Problems: several grammar and word‑choice errors: “It is because” is weak, “produces and services” should be “products and services,” “ensuring employees to be competitive” → “helping employees remain competitive,” subject–verb agreement in “which contribute” → “which contributes.”
- Short phrase edits to try:
  - Start with “This is because creativity drives innovation and problem‑solving…”
  - Replace “produces and services” with “products and services”
  - Replace “ensuring employees to be competitive” with “helping employees remain competitive”
  - End with “which contributes to company growth/progress.”

Your turn (small revision task)
Would you like to try one quick revision now? Try editing one sentence (pick sentence 1, 2, or 3) using the short phrase options above and paste it here. I’ll give a quick micro‑feedback and then we can update the essay together.

In recent years, automation is not an unfamiliar term for us. Employers use AI to perform routine tasks to reduce hiring costs and enhance efficiency. Automation is transforming industries, resulting in boost in technological industries. Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term because it creates new technical and maintenance positions and shifts workers into higher-skilled, creative roles.

First, automation creates new technical and maintenance positions, such as AI technicians and maintenance engineers. As companies deploy more AI systems to complete routine tasks, they must hire technicians to maintain systems and quality‑assurance staff to ensure outputs meet standards. Because AI lacks human judgment and ethical reasoning, people are still needed to interpret results and make context‑sensitive decisions. Together, these developments show that automation not only displaces tasks but also creates technical and maintenance roles that support the thesis.

Second, speeding up the manufacturing process via automation allows employees to shift into high-skilled, creative roles such as product design and strategic problem-solving

As automation streamlines routine production tasks, which frees employees from time-consuming, repetitive tasks, humans is allowed to focus on creativity, logical thinking and jobs that require empathy. For example, creativity is more important than completing routine tasks. It is because it drives innovation and problem-solving by encouraging new ideas and produces and services, ensuring employees to be competitive, which contribute to company progress.

To conclude, automation may cause some job replacement, while it also creates more job opportunities for humans and speeds up the processes in jobs. It may lead to a brighter global employment prospects in long term.

Next step
- If you want, try revising one of the three sentences now (I recommend starting with sentence 1). Paste your revision and I’ll give a quick targeted suggestion.
- After we polish those sentences, we can (a) tighten grammar and vocabulary in the paragraph and then (b) decide whether to refine the conclusion to match the improved thesis and paragraph.

Which sentence would you like to revise now?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T15:24:22.956Z

**You:** As automation streamlines time-comsuming, routine production tasks, it allow workers to focus on higher‑skilled, creative, and interpersonal tasks that require empathy and judgment. For example, creative skills matter more important than repetitive task performance in roles like marketing planner. This is because creativity drives innovation and problem-solving by encouraging new ideas and products and services, helping employees remain competitive, which contributes to company progress.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T15:31:12.244Z

**Assistant:** Well done — you’ve made a strong attempt to revise paragraph 3 and you’re tackling the harder tasks (clarity, grammar, and linking to the thesis). Let’s look at what you wrote, give quick, specific feedback, and then try a small revision together.

First, here is your full essay with your three new sentences for paragraph 3 inserted exactly as you wrote them so you can see the paragraph in context:

Focused, short feedback on each of your three sentences (what to fix and why)
1) Sentence: "As automation streamlines time-comsuming, routine production tasks, it allow workers to focus on higher‑skilled, creative, and interpersonal tasks that require empathy and judgment."
- Main issues:
  - Spelling: "time‑comsuming" → time‑consuming.
  - Subject–verb agreement: "it allow" → it allows.
  - Word choice / parallelism: "higher‑skilled" → use "higher‑skilled" or "highly skilled" consistently (I recommend "higher‑skilled" to match your thesis). Keep lists parallel (e.g., "higher‑skilled, creative, and interpersonal tasks").
- Tip: Remove extra commas and the comma after "tasks" that breaks the flow.

2) Sentence: "For example, creative skills matter more important than repetitive task performance in roles like marketing planner."
- Main issues:
  - Grammar: "matter more important than" is incorrect. Use "are more important than" or "matter more than."
  - Word choice: "repetitive task performance" is wordy. Use "performing repetitive tasks" or "routine task performance."
  - Job title: "marketing planner" is okay but consider a clearer title like "marketing planner/marketing manager" or "brand strategist" if you want a common example.
- Tip: Make the sentence connect to the previous one: "For example, in roles such as X, creative skills are more important than performing routine tasks."

3) Sentence: "This is because creativity drives innovation and problem-solving by encouraging new ideas and products and services, helping employees remain competitive, which contributes to company progress."
- Main issues:
  - Word choice and typos: "products and services" (not "produces and services").
  - Sentence structure: the clause chain is long and a bit confusing. Consider splitting into two short clauses or using a clearer connector.
  - Final clause: "which contributes to company progress" → clearer: "which contributes to company growth" or "which contributes to firm competitiveness."
- Tip: Start with "This is because creativity drives innovation and problem‑solving, leading to new products and services and helping employees remain competitive."

Quick templates and short phrase options you can adapt (not full rewrites — use to guide your revision)
- For sentence 1 (use one):
  - "As automation streamlines routine production tasks, it allows workers to focus on higher‑skilled, creative, and interpersonal tasks that require empathy and judgment."
  - OR split into two: "Automation streamlines routine production tasks. This allows workers to focus on higher‑skilled, creative tasks that require empathy and judgment."

- For sentence 2 (use one):
  - "For example, in roles such as marketing manager or brand strategist, creative skills are more important than performing repetitive tasks."
  - OR "For example, creative skills matter more than routine task performance in jobs like product design and marketing."

- For sentence 3 (use one):
  - "This is because creativity drives innovation and problem‑solving, producing new products and services and helping employees remain competitive."
  - OR "Creativity leads to new products and services and helps employees stay competitive, which contributes to company growth."

Interactive next step — your choice (pick one)
A) Try revising sentence 1 now (recommended). Paste your new version and I’ll give very quick feedback.  
B) Try revising sentence 2 now. Paste it and I’ll respond.  
C) Try revising sentence 3 now. Paste it and I’ll respond.  
D) If you prefer, revise all three and paste them together — I’ll give focused feedback on the combined result.

Also tell me which revision targets you want me to focus on for this micro‑step (pick up to two): grammar/accuracy / clarity & cohesion / vocabulary precision.

Which option do you choose? Try one sentence now — I’ll keep feedback short and encouraging so you can finish this paragraph quickly.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T15:31:53.498Z

**You:** As automation streamlines time-consuming, routine production tasks, it allows workers to focus on higher‑skilled, creative, and interpersonal tasks that require empathy and judgment. For example,  in roles like brand strategists, creative skills are more important than performing repetitive tasks. Creativity leads to new products and services and helps employees remain competitive, which contributes to firm competitiveness.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T15:38:30.110Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this paragraph is much clearer and now matches your thesis: you explain the mechanism, give an example, and show the benefit for firms and workers. Well done.

Three quick, focused points to improve (micro‑edits)
1. Small grammar/spelling:
   - time‑consuming (hyphen) — you already have this correct.
   - Subject–verb: your sentences now use correct verbs (“it allows”) — good.

2. Tiny phrasing/flow:
   - “For example,  in roles like brand strategists,” has an extra space after the comma. Also consider “roles such as brand strategists” (either is fine).

3. Redundancy:
   - The sentence “Creativity leads to new products and services and helps employees remain competitive, which contributes to firm competitiveness.” repeats “competitive/competitiveness.” Consider replacing the final phrase with “firm growth” or “firm competitiveness” (only once).

Would you like to try a tiny revision now?
- If yes: try rewriting just the final sentence (one short sentence) to avoid the repetition. Try to keep your meaning: creativity leads to new products/services and helps employees stay competitive, which benefits the firm.
- If you prefer a model to adapt, here are two very short options you can copy or change:
  1) “Creativity leads to new products and services and helps employees remain competitive, which contributes to firm growth.”
  2) “Creativity drives innovation — producing new products and services and helping employees stay competitive, which benefits the firm.”

Please try one short revision (paste the sentence). After you post it I’ll give a quick check and then, if you want, show the full essay with your corrected paragraph included.

Which small edit would you like to make next?
- Revise that final sentence in paragraph 3 (recommended), or
- I can make the micro‑edits for you and show the updated full essay (only if you want me to suggest the exact change), or
- Move on to polishing the conclusion or grammar across the essay.

Pick one option and we’ll continue — you’re nearly finished with a strong revision.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T15:38:55.997Z

**You:** Is it any suggestions to paragraph 4, conculsion.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T15:42:26.259Z

**Assistant:** Nice question — good instinct to polish the conclusion. Quick praise first: your conclusion already restates the main idea (automation both displaces and creates jobs) — that’s the right move. A few focused suggestions will make it stronger, clearer, and more academic.

Brief diagnosis (what to fix)
- Content: It repeats ideas already said rather than synthesizing them. A conclusion should restate the thesis in new words, briefly summarize the main reasons, and end with a final implication or recommendation.
- Language: Small grammar and phrasing problems make it sound awkward (e.g., “speeds up the processes in jobs,” “a brighter global employment prospects,” “in long term”).
- Tone: Use confident, precise language (avoid overly hedging words if your thesis was confident).

Concrete checklist — what to do when you rewrite
1. Restate the thesis in different words (avoid word‑for‑word repetition).
2. Summarize the 1–2 main reasons you developed (one short sentence).
3. End with a final thought: an implication, recommendation, or broader significance.
4. Fix grammar/wording: use “the long term,” “workers/employees,” “output quality,” “manufacturing,” etc.
5. Keep it short — 2–3 sentences total.

Helpful stems you can use to build your own sentences (adapt these — try to write your own)
- Restating thesis (stem): Although automation displaces some routine roles, it ultimately [will / can] improve long‑term employment prospects because it [creates technical and maintenance roles] and [shifts workers into higher‑skilled, creative positions].
- Summarizing reasons (stem): In particular, automation creates new technical and quality‑assurance jobs and frees workers to take on higher‑value tasks that require creativity, judgment, and empathy.
- Closing/implication (stem): To ensure these gains are widely shared, policymakers and employers should [support retraining/reskilling, strengthen social safety nets, encourage responsible deployment of AI], or end with a short forward‑looking sentence: This shift therefore points to a long‑term opportunity for workers who adapt.

Two quick grammar fixes for your current sentences
- “It may lead to a brighter global employment prospects in long term.” → remove the extra article and add “the”: “It may lead to brighter global employment prospects in the long term.” (Or rewrite confidently depending on your stance.)
- “speeds up the processes in jobs” → “speeds up work processes” or “improves productivity.”

Would you like to try rewriting the conclusion now using the stems? Paste your version and I’ll give focused feedback. If you want, after you revise I can insert your new conclusion into the full essay and show you the updated text. Which would you like to do?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T15:42:53.254Z

**You:** To conclude, automation displaces some routine roles, while it ultimately will improve long‑term employment prospects because it creates technical and maintenance positions and shifts workers into higher‑skilled, creative roles. To ensure these gains are widely shared, policymakers and employers should support reskilling and encourage responsible deployment of AI. This shift therefore points to a long‑term opportunity for workers who adapt.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T15:51:46.189Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that conclusion does what a good ending should: it restates the main claim, summarizes the key reasons, and adds a practical implication (reskilling / responsible deployment). Well done.

Two very small suggestions you might consider (quick edits you can accept or ignore):
- Tighten the phrasing to avoid small redundancy: “displaces some routine roles, while it ultimately will improve…” → “displaces some routine roles, while ultimately improving…” or “displaces some routine roles, but ultimately improves…”
- Use “the long term” (with “the”) if you keep the phrase, and try to avoid repeating near‑synonyms in the same line (e.g., “remain competitive” and “firm competitiveness”).

Would you like me to:
A) Make a tiny edit to tighten the conclusion now (I can suggest one brief alternative), or
B) Keep your version as is and insert it into the full essay so you can see the final draft in context?

I’ve inserted your conclusion exactly as you wrote it into the latest revised essay below so you can see the whole piece in context. If you want a tightened version, tell me which option (A or B) and I’ll show the updated full essay.

**You:** To conclude, automation displaces some routine roles, while ultimately improving long‑term employment prospects because it creates technical and maintenance positions and shifts workers into higher‑skilled, creative roles. This shift therefore points to a long‑term opportunity for workers who adapt.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T15:56:11.820Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — you’ve written a clear, confident concluding pair of sentences that restate your claim and add a useful implication. Before we move on, let’s confirm targets and next steps so we can revise efficiently.

1) Quick question — what do you most want to work on next? (Pick any that apply.)
- Strengthen the thesis (clarity, parallelism, concision)
- Revise a body-paragraph topic sentence to match the thesis
- Revise one body paragraph’s supporting sentences for clarity, unity, and evidence
- Improve vocabulary and word choice across the chosen paragraph
- Fix grammar and sentence-level errors in the chosen paragraph
- Polish the whole essay for grammar and style (note: our scope is limited to thesis + one paragraph)

2) Short diagnostic feedback (using the rubric categories)
- Content & Ideas: The essay now has a clear, consistent viewpoint: automation ultimately improves employment prospects. Paragraphs give plausible reasons (new technical roles; shift to higher-skilled, creative work). Strength: clearer argument and concrete examples. Weakness: some claims could use stronger evidence or tighter explanation; some repetition remains.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Structure is clear (thesis → two development paragraphs → conclusion). Paragraph 2 and 3 mostly match the thesis. Transitions could be slightly smoother in places.
- Vocabulary: Improved with more precise terms (technicians, quality‑assurance). A few collocations and word choices still feel non‑native or slightly awkward (e.g., “resulting in boost in technological industries,” “high‑skilled” vs “higher‑skilled”).
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Many sentences are clear now, but several small grammatical issues remain (articles, subject‑verb agreement, punctuation, hyphenation). These are fixable with focused micro‑edits.

3) Choose priorities for this session (pick up to three)
Which 1–3 issues from the diagnosis above shall we focus on now? Example sets you might pick:
- Strengthen the thesis + revise paragraph 2 topic sentence + fix grammar in paragraph 2
- Revise paragraph 3 topic sentence + improve paragraph 3 supporting sentences + vocabulary
- Only grammar and vocabulary in the paragraph you choose

4) Confirm scope & paragraph choice
Reminder: I’ll work only on (a) the thesis statement, (b) one body paragraph’s topic sentence, and (c) that paragraph’s supporting sentences. Which paragraph do you want to revise with me in Steps 2–3?
- Paragraph 2 (new technical/maintenance jobs)
- Paragraph 3 (shift to higher‑skilled, creative roles)

Also: do you want to revise the thesis now, or keep the current thesis as-is?
Your current thesis (as used in the essay) is:
Automation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects because it creates new technical and maintenance positions and shifts workers into higher‑skilled, creative roles.
- Keep as is
- Revise now (I’ll prompt you to try a new one)

5) Because you made a change to the conclusion, here is the full essay with your final concluding sentences inserted so you can see the whole text in one place (I’ve used the latest revised paragraphs we worked on):

6) Ready to begin Step 1 (thesis)?
If you want to revise the thesis now, try writing one short sentence that:
- Uses confident language (avoid “may” or “might”),
- Previews 2–3 clear reasons (parallel structure),
- Is concise.

Would you like to:
A) Try revising the thesis now (paste one sentence and I’ll give brief feedback), or
B) Keep the thesis and go straight to revising the topic sentence of Paragraph 2 or 3? (If B, tell me which paragraph.)

Tell me your choices for (a) priorities from #3, (b) paragraph choice, and (c) whether you want to revise the thesis now. Then we’ll start Step 1.
