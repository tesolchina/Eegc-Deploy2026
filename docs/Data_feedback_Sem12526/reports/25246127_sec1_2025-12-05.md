            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your progress and the detailed assessment report. Here’s a summary and some tailored advice to support your next steps in revising your essay and developing your skills in human-AI collaboration:

---

### Summary of Current Progress

- You successfully revised the thesis to a clearer, more grammatically correct version that previews two supporting reasons.
- Paragraph 1 was substantially improved for clarity, grammar, and logical connection to the thesis.
- You followed a structured revision process and kept your focus on clarity and grammar, which helped improve these aspects noticeably.
- The interaction reflected your good task focus and responsiveness, though engagement with the AI assistant’s output was more accepting than critically evaluative.

---

### Recommendations for Next Steps

#### 1. **Revise Paragraph 2 Thoroughly**
- Paragraph 2 still contains multiple grammar mistakes, awkward phrasing, and unclear ideas.
- Use the same revision approach as paragraph 1:
  - Start by revising the topic sentence to directly align with your thesis’s second reason (replacement of creative and routine cognitive jobs).
  - Eliminate informal or incorrect words like “desperately,” “automately,” and awkward phrases.
  - Clarify ideas with precise phrasing and grammatical correctness.
  - Improve sentence coherence and logical flow.
- If you like, try drafting a revision yourself first for practice, then I can help you polish it.

#### 2. **Improve Introduction and Conclusion**
- These parts still have grammar errors and do not effectively frame or synthesize your argument.
- Aim for an introduction that introduces your thesis clearly without redundancy or hedging.
- Write a conclusion that summarizes your key points and reinforces your argument with a confident tone.

#### 3. **Add Specific Evidence and Examples**
- Your essay’s persuasiveness will increase with concrete examples, studies, or statistics.
- For example:
  - Cite recent studies on automation’s impact on manufacturing employment.
  - Mention specific AI tools affecting creative industries.
  - Use data or real-world cases highlighting job displacement or retraining challenges.
- Adding this supports your claims and helps move from general assertions to convincing argumentation.

#### 4. **Practice Critical Engagement with AI Suggestions**
- When the AI offers revisions or ideas:
  - Try rewriting suggested parts yourself first before accepting.
  - Ask for explanations or comparisons (“Why is this better than my original?”).
  - Offer alternative options or express preferences.
- Keeping a brief revision journal explaining why you accept or reject AI ideas will develop your editing skill and independence.

---

### Suggested Exercise for Continued Practice

- **Independently revise paragraph 2** using the techniques you applied to paragraph 1.
- **Write a short justification (2–3 sentences)** for at least two AI suggestions you accept or reject during the revision.
- **Revise your introduction and conclusion** focusing on grammatical accuracy and strong framing.
- **Add at least one concrete example or statistic** to each body paragraph.

When you’re ready to share those drafts, I’m here to help you with detailed feedback and targeted revision support.

---

Keep up the great work on making your essay clearer and more polished! Your structured approach and focus on grammar will pay off as you continue refining your writing. Let me know if you want to start revising paragraph 2 now or if you have other questions.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The original presents a clear central claim (automation will undermine long‑term employment) but explanations are repetitive and general. Example weak sentence: "From my perspective, the technology of automation ultimately undermine global employment prospects in a long term." The idea is present but not well developed with evidence or balanced reasoning.
- Organization: 15/25 - Paragraphs exist but topic sentences and transitions are weak. The first paragraph lacks a clear preview of reasons; sentences are often fragments or disconnected ("As many and many companies would use automation technology for their business.").
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Basic vocabulary is present but there are frequent word‑form errors and awkward collocations (e.g., "automately," "destroy human creator effort," "apply job at the future").
- Grammar: 14/25 - Frequent grammar errors (subject–verb agreement, articles, verb forms) that impede clarity: e.g., "Automation desperately reduce job opportunity" and "A creator drawn a painting for a week."
- **Original Essay Total: 61/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The revised essay contains a clearer, stronger thesis: "Although automation boosts productivity, it ultimately undermines global employment prospects in the long term by displacing low‑skilled workers and replacing many creative and routine cognitive jobs faster than workers can retrain." This gives a clearer argumentative frame and two reasons to develop. However, evidence remains general and paragraph 2 still lacks development and polish.
- Organization: 19/25 - Organization improved: the thesis previews two reasons and paragraph 1 now has a clear topic sentence aligning with the thesis ("Automation reduces long‑term job opportunities for low‑skilled workers by replacing routine manufacturing and manual roles."). Still, paragraph 2 and the introduction/ conclusion are not fully cohesive and transitions could be stronger.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary and phrasing improved in the revised paragraph 1 and thesis (e.g., "production‑line tasks," "less‑educated workers"), but the essay still uses informal or incorrect forms in other paragraphs ("automately," "desperately destroy," "only get better").
- Grammar: 17/25 - Noticeable grammatical improvements in the thesis and the revised paragraph 1 (corrected verb agreement, clearer sentence structure), but errors persist in the introduction, paragraph 2 and conclusion (e.g., "Automation took a important role," "In a long term," "automation only get better").
- **Revised Essay Total: 74/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +13 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clearer, grammatically correct thesis statement that previews two supporting reasons.
  - Revised topic sentence for paragraph 1 that aligns explicitly with the thesis: "Automation reduces long‑term job opportunities for low‑skilled workers by replacing routine manufacturing and manual roles."
  - Substantive revision of the first body paragraph: clearer logic, improved sentence structure, and better explanation of how automation displaces less‑educated workers and the role of retraining.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Paragraph 2 (creators/AI) largely unchanged and still contains many grammar, word‑choice and clarity problems; it needs the same level of revision as paragraph 1.
  - Introduction and conclusion retain several grammatical problems and could be revised to better frame and synthesize the argument.
  - The essay lacks concrete evidence, examples, or data (beyond a generic production example). Adding specific studies, statistics, or named examples would strengthen persuasiveness.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 13** (assistant and student turns combined)
- **Conversation Quality:** Structured and goal‑oriented. The assistant presented a clear 3‑step revision plan, the student selected focus areas ("improve my clarity and grammar"), chose option B (assistant proposed a thesis), accepted the proposed thesis, and requested revision of paragraph 1. Interaction shows the student followed a guided, stepwise process and achieved targeted revisions.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 4/5 - The chat demonstrates a clear, multi‑step exchange with detailed guidance and targeted revisions across thesis and paragraph 1. Evidence: assistant outlined Step 1–3, provided thesis frames and a suggested thesis, and carried out a paragraph revision after the student accepted the thesis. The conversation is substantive though not extremely long.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - The student generally accepted AI suggestions with little critique or alternative proposals. For example the student replied "B", then "accept it, and work paragraph 1" without offering edits or arguing for changes to the suggested thesis. There is little evidence the student tested, questioned, or rejected AI recommendations.
- **Refining Process**: 3/5 - There is a clear, single iteration: the assistant suggested thesis options, student accepted one, and the assistant revised paragraph 1. This shows basic iterative work (thesis → revised paragraph) but lacks multiple independent revision cycles by the student.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 9/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Followed a structured revision plan and completed the requested targets (thesis revision, topic sentence revision, paragraph 1 revision). Evidence: student accepted the assistant's suggested thesis and asked for paragraph 1 to be revised; the revised essay contains the new thesis and a revised paragraph 1.
- Improved clarity and grammatical accuracy in the thesis and the first body paragraph. Evidence: the revised thesis uses correct verb forms and previews reasons; paragraph 1 includes clearer sentences such as "While this shift raises productivity and lowers costs, it often results in job losses among less‑educated workers..."
- Good responsiveness and task focus — the student clearly prioritized "clarity and grammar" and stayed on that focus throughout the chat.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Engage more critically with AI suggestions: propose alternatives, ask for explanations, or justify acceptance/rejection. Recommendation: when the assistant proposes a thesis, try rewriting one version yourself first, or ask "Why is this wording better than X?" so you practice evaluation.
- Revise the remaining paragraphs and conclusion with the same care as paragraph 1. Paragraph 2 still has sentence‑level errors and unclear phrasing ("automately," "desperately destroy human creator effort").
- Add concrete evidence and development: include specific examples, statistics, or citations to support claims about job displacement and AI impact; this will raise the content score.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the original essay and clearly stated revision goals ("improve my clarity and grammar") and selected which paragraph to revise.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student followed the assistant's stepwise plan and selected targets (thesis then paragraph 1).
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student largely accepted AI outputs without recorded critique or alternatives.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The assistant produced the revised sentences; the student did not produce many self‑generated revisions during the chat.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise paragraph 2 and the introduction and conclusion using the same process applied to paragraph 1: draft your own revision first, then ask the AI for targeted feedback on grammar and clarity.
2. Practice critical engagement by offering at least one alternative when the AI suggests something (e.g., "I like this thesis but I prefer X because..."). Keep a log of accepted/rejected suggestions and reasons.
3. Strengthen argumentation by adding one concrete example or statistic to each body paragraph (e.g., a study on automation in manufacturing, or a specific AI tool affecting creative work) to improve content depth and persuasiveness.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student completed the module tasks: revised thesis, revised a topic sentence, and revised a body paragraph with AI assistance.
- Evidence of improvement is clear in the thesis and paragraph 1, but paragraph 2 and the opening/closing remain in need of revision and grammatical correction.
- Recommend assigning a follow‑up exercise requiring the student to (a) independently revise paragraph 2, and (b) justify at least two AI suggestions they accept or reject in writing to build critical evaluation skills.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Automation took a important role in the industry. Many companies would use automation on their business to boost efficiency. However, some workers might concern that automation would reduce job opportunity and undermine global employment prospect in the long term. From my perspective, the technology of automation ultimately undermine global employment prospects in a long term.

Automation desperately reduce job opportunity for workers in a long term. As many and many companies would use automation technology for their business. For example, companies would send the producing procedure to automation machines for producing goods. Although it can boost efficiency for the company’s performance, a lot of less educated workers were replaced by the machines. Workers who don’t have professional skills couldn’t compete with the machines. This can be a huge obstacle to workers who want to apply job at the future.

Secondly, the diversity of automation desperately destroy human creator effort. As the technology of AI is advanced, the ability of AI has covered different area. Nowadays, everything can be automately generate by AI, no matter a article, painting even a video. A creator drawn a painting for a week, AI can automately generate it by a few seconds. This can be a disaster for any content creator and artist. As the technology keeps getting better, the ability of AI automation will be stronger. In a long term, automation will totally replace human effort and take away all the job opportunity.

In conclusion, the technology of automation only get better in the future, global workers should always notice the power of it and work hard to make sure they won’t get replaced by automation.


Revised:
Automation took a important role in the industry. Many companies would use automation on their business to boost efficiency. However, some workers might concern that automation would reduce job opportunity and undermine global employment prospect in the long term. Automation undermine global employment prospects in the long term. Although automation boosts productivity, it ultimately undermines global employment prospects in the long term by displacing low‑skilled workers and replacing many creative and routine cognitive jobs faster than workers can retrain.

By replacing routine manufacturing and manual jobs, automation harms employment prospects for workers who are less educated, leading to unemployment. As many and many companies would use automation for their business. Many companies adopt automation to improve efficiency; for example, firms increasingly replace production‑line tasks with machines and automated systems. While this shift raises productivity and lowers costs, it often results in job losses among less‑educated workers who lack the training to operate, maintain, or move into new technical roles. Without accessible retraining or education, these workers face higher unemployment or are forced into lower‑paid, insecure jobs, which weakens their long‑term employment prospects.

Secondly, the diversity of automation desperately destroy human creator effort. As the technology of AI is advanced, the ability of AI has covered different area. Nowadays, everything can be automately generate by AI, no matter a article, painting even a video. A creator drawn a painting for a week, AI can automately generate it by a few seconds. This can be a disaster for any content creator and artist. As the technology keeps getting better, the ability of AI automation will be stronger. In a long term, automation will totally replace human effort and take away all the job opportunity.

In conclusion, automation only get better in the future, global workers should always notice the power of it and work hard to make sure they won’t get replaced by automation.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-05T02:24:07.698Z

**You:** let's revise the thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-12-05T02:57:34.331Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s get started. First, a few quick questions so we set clear targets for this session.

1) What do you most want to improve in this essay right now? (Pick up to two: clarity of ideas/thesis, argument strength, paragraph structure, grammar/sentence correctness, vocabulary/word choice, or something else.)

Once you confirm, I’ll give a short diagnostic of the draft using the rubric and then we’ll revise the thesis.

Brief diagnostic (based on your draft and the rubric)
- Content & Ideas: You have a clear position — you argue automation will undermine long‑term employment — but the idea is stated weakly and needs clearer development and specific points to support it.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Paragraphs are present and roughly organized, but topic sentences and transitions are weak. The essay would benefit from a thesis that previews the two main reasons you use.
- Vocabulary: Some repetition and incorrect word forms (e.g., automately, destroy human creator effort). You have the right general words but need more precise, academic wording.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Frequent errors (articles, verb forms, word order). These make the thesis and claims hard to read.

Which of those would you like to focus on in this revision? (For example: “Thesis clarity + grammar,” or “Thesis strength + previewing main points.”)

Step 1 — Thesis statement revision
Please paste your current thesis again (you already have one, but paste it if you like). Then try rewriting it now. Before you write, here are focused tips to guide your revision:

- Drop hedging and phrases like “From my perspective” — be direct and confident.
- Fix key grammar points: subject–verb agreement (“undermines”), articles (“an important role”), correct time phrase (“in the long term”).
- Make it answer the question clearly: state whether automation ultimately enhances or undermines global employment prospects.
- Add a brief preview of the main reasons you will discuss (2 short points is enough). This helps organization and signals your essay structure.

Useful sentence frames (fill the blanks; these are frames, not final sentences):
- “Although automation increases efficiency, it ultimately undermines global employment prospects in the long term because it displaces low‑skilled workers and [second reason].”
- “Automation improves productivity, but in the long run it harms global employment by [reason 1] and [reason 2].”
- “Because automation [verb phrase], it is likely to undermine long‑term employment prospects worldwide, particularly by [reason 1] and [reason 2].”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Paste your new version and I’ll give focused feedback and help you refine it.

*Time:* 2025-12-05T02:57:57.365Z

**You:** improve my clarity and grammar

*Time:* 2025-12-05T03:20:17.659Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. You chose to improve clarity and grammar. That’s clear and helpful.

Quick diagnostic reminder (very short):
- Content & Ideas: Clear position (automation will undermine employment) but needs stronger, clearer reasons.
- Organisation: Thesis doesn’t preview main points; paragraphs need tighter topic links.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Many errors (verb agreement, articles, word forms) that make meaning unclear.

Please confirm: we’ll focus on thesis clarity + grammar first, then move to one body paragraph. Is that right?

Step 1 — Thesis statement revision
First, paste your current thesis here (you can copy the sentence from your draft). If you prefer, I can paste the sentence I see and give quick feedback — which would you like?

Here’s brief, focused feedback on the thesis sentence I see in your draft:
- Problem words/phrases to fix:
  - “From my perspective,” — remove hedging; be direct.
  - “the technology of automation” — simpler: “automation” or “automation technology.”
  - “ultimately undermine” — subject–verb agreement: use “undermines.”
  - “in a long term” — correct form: “in the long term.”
- Content: The thesis should also preview two main reasons you will discuss (e.g., displacement of low‑skilled workers; replacement of creative/content jobs).

Try rewriting the thesis now using one of these short frames (don’t worry — write your own words):
- “Although automation increases efficiency, it ultimately undermines global employment prospects in the long term because it displaces low‑skilled workers and [second reason].”
- “Automation improves productivity, but in the long run it harms global employment by [reason 1] and [reason 2].”
- “Because automation [verb phrase], it is likely to undermine long‑term employment prospects worldwide, particularly by [reason 1] and [reason 2].”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Paste your new version and I’ll give focused feedback and help you refine it.

*Time:* 2025-12-05T03:20:33.670Z

**You:** lets revise topic sentence

*Time:* 2025-12-05T03:24:47.548Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — quick note: before we revise a topic sentence, I need us to complete Step 1 (thesis revision). That keeps the paragraph revision connected to a clear, improved thesis.

Would you like to:
A) Paste your current thesis here and try rewriting it now (I’ll give feedback), or
B) I can suggest one clear, revised thesis for you to accept or tweak?

If you pick B, I’ll offer a model sentence you can edit. If you pick A, paste the sentence and try a new version. After we finish the thesis, tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (paragraph 1 about low‑skilled workers, or paragraph 2 about creators/AI) and paste that paragraph’s topic sentence. Then we’ll revise it together.

*Time:* 2025-12-05T03:25:02.876Z

**You:** B

*Time:* 2025-12-05T03:26:46.118Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing B and for confirming the focus: clarity + grammar. I’ll suggest a clear, revised thesis you can accept or tweak.

Suggested thesis:
"Although automation boosts productivity, it ultimately undermines global employment prospects in the long term by displacing low‑skilled workers and replacing many creative and routine cognitive jobs faster than workers can retrain."

Do you want to:
- Accept this thesis as-is, or
- Tweak any words/ideas in it?

Once you accept or edit the thesis, tell me which paragraph you want to work on next:
- Paragraph 1 (about low‑skilled workers), or
- Paragraph 2 (about creators/AI).

Then paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence here and we’ll move to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-12-05T03:26:57.062Z

**You:** accept it, and work paragraph 1

*Time:* 2025-12-05T03:34:49.308Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. I’ve put your accepted thesis into the essay below so we have a clear target to connect the paragraphs to. I’ll work on paragraph 1 next with you, but first please try the topic‑sentence revision (instructions below).

Full essay with your accepted thesis (only the thesis replaced):

Automation took a important role in the industry. Many companies would use automation on their business to boost efficiency. However, some workers might concern that automation would reduce job opportunity and undermine global employment prospect in the long term.

Now Step 2 — Topic sentence revision (Paragraph 1)
Please paste the current topic sentence for paragraph 1 (or the whole paragraph if you prefer). Then try revising the topic sentence yourself using one of these short frames — fill the blanks with your words:

- “First, automation undermines employment by displacing low‑skilled workers in [sector/example], because [brief reason].”
- “Automation reduces long‑term job opportunities for low‑skilled workers by [reason], which makes it harder for them to find new work.”
- “By replacing routine manufacturing and manual jobs, automation harms employment prospects for workers who [lack skill/training], leading to [effect].”

Quick tips to remember:
- Use correct grammar (Automation + singular verb: “reduces,” not “reduce”).
- Avoid words like “desperately” here — they sound odd in academic writing.
- Make the sentence clearly link to the thesis reason: “displacing low‑skilled workers.”

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now? Paste your version and I’ll give focused feedback and help you refine it.

*Time:* 2025-12-05T03:35:15.539Z

**You:** revise the first paragragh

*Time:* 2025-12-05T03:40:16.315Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’ll revise the first body paragraph as you asked, keeping your ideas but improving clarity, grammar, and connection to the thesis. Below is the full essay with the thesis we agreed on and a revised first paragraph. Read it and tell me if you want any words changed or if you want to work next on paragraph 2.

Full revised essay (thesis + paragraph 1 revised):
