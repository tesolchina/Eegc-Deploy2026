            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing the chat history and the report. It’s clear the student engaged with the revision steps in a procedural way but did not produce real, substantive text changes or engage critically with the AI’s guidance. The assessment report correctly highlights the lack of meaningful revision and reliance on placeholders.

If you would like, I can help you draft a constructive message or plan to guide the student toward genuine essay revision and more active AI collaboration. Or, if you want assistance with a specific next step such as creating example revisions for thesis, topic sentences, or paragraphs to model for the student, just let me know!

## Module: AI for Revising Essays

---

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 – The essay clearly presents a viewpoint and two main ideas (citizen influence on government; individuals’ lifestyle choices). Awareness of the issue is evident, but arguments could be more fully developed.
- Organization: 19/25 – The essay generally follows a logical structure (introduction, body, conclusion), with adequate paragraphing. Some sentences could be better connected for smoother logical flow.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 – Vocabulary is mostly adequate and appropriate for the topic. Occasional imprecisions and limited variety in expressions.
- Grammar: 17/25 – Sentence structure is mostly clear, though some errors (e.g., verb tense, sentence fragments) affect clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 74/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 – Revised essay includes placeholder text (“bla bla bla”), indicating no substantive revision or development of content or clarity.
- Organization: 17/25 – No indication of improved transitions or logical progression. Structure from original is maintained but not enhanced.
- Vocabulary: 16/25 – No clear extension of vocabulary range beyond original; use of placeholders suggests missed opportunity to refine language.
- Grammar: 16/25 – No evidence of improved sentence structure or grammatical accuracy. Areas noted for improvement remain.
- **Revised Essay Total: 67/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: –7 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - No meaningful improvements in thesis, topic sentence, or body paragraph content (placeholders present).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Revision steps not fully completed (real thesis/topic sentence/paragraph changes missing).
  - Failure to develop ideas, language, and organization further as guided by the AI.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9**
- **Conversation Quality:** The chat shows the student moved stepwise through the revision process but substituted substantive content with placeholders (“let’s pretend… bla bla bla…”) at each stage. No actual revision or critical engagement with AI suggestions occurred, and the student did not provide revised sentences as prompted.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 – While structured and multi-step, the conversation content lacks depth and actual revision. Student repeatedly requested to skip steps or use placeholders instead of interacting in depth.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 – No evidence of evaluating, justifying, or accepting/rejecting AI suggestions. The student does not engage in critique or decision-making.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 – The AI led the student through multiple steps, but the student did not actually revise or iterate—simply moved forward using placeholders.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 5/15**

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-18T04:51:58.979Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-18T04:52:19.579Z

**Assistant:** Wonderful! Let’s begin with **Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**.

Thank you for sharing your thesis statement:

> "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

**Let’s look at your thesis together:**

**Strengths:**
- You clearly express a balanced point of view (“partly agree”).
- You mention both main points: the influence on government, and the role of personal choices.

**Areas to Improve:**
- The thesis could be clearer and more direct about what your main points will be.
- Try to avoid phrases like “I think” and make your language more confident.
- Preview the structure: can you signal more clearly which points you will discuss and in what order?

**Guided Prompts:**
- Can you turn this into one clear, confident statement that directly presents your two main arguments?
- For example, use phrases like: “While government action is crucial, individuals are essential both as influencers of policy and as role models through their own green choices.”

**Your Turn:**  
Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement to make it:
1. Direct and confident,
2. Clear about your viewpoint,
3. Previewing your two main supporting points (influencing government + lifestyle choices)?

Give it a try below! I’ll review your version and offer feedback before we go to the next step.

*Time:* 2025-11-18T04:52:25.344Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on     bla bla bla...

*Time:* 2025-11-18T05:05:58.993Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s move on to **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**.

First, please choose **one body paragraph** (either the paragraph about influencing government, or the paragraph about personal green lifestyle choices) that you’d like to work on. 

Then, copy and share the current topic sentence of that paragraph.

Once you share, I’ll offer feedback on how well that topic sentence connects to your revised thesis and how clearly it introduces the main idea of the paragraph.

Which paragraph would you like to focus on? Please paste the topic sentence below, and we’ll work through revising it together!

*Time:* 2025-11-18T05:06:01.549Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on.      bla bla bla…

*Time:* 2025-11-18T05:10:16.339Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let's move on to **Step 3: Revising the Rest of Your Chosen Paragraph**.

I’ll guide you through strengthening your supporting sentences for clarity, unity, and coherence, focusing on the paragraph with your revised topic sentence.

**Here’s what to check as you review the paragraph:**

1. **Connection:**  
Do all your supporting details directly relate to your new topic sentence? Is it clear how each example supports your main idea?

2. **Explanation & Examples:**  
Are your examples clear and specific? Do you explain how each detail shows the paragraph’s main point?

3. **Coherence & Flow:**  
Do your sentences flow logically, connecting one idea to the next? Are there any points that need smoother transitions or clearer links?

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is there any part of the paragraph that feels off-topic or less relevant to your topic sentence?
- Would any examples benefit from a little more explanation (“How does this show citizens influence government?”)?
- Does the paragraph end with a strong closing sentence that ties ideas back to your main point?

**Your Turn:**  
Read through your chosen paragraph and identify:
- One sentence or example that could be improved for clarity or detail.
- Any place that seems a bit disconnected from your new topic sentence.

Share one area you’d like to revise, or a sentence you think could be strengthened. I’ll give you feedback or hints to help—would you like to try revising a sentence now?

*Time:* 2025-11-18T05:10:21.187Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1


bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-11-18T05:11:36.458Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let's focus on revising **body paragraph #1** about citizens influencing government.

Here’s what you have for that paragraph:

> When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

Let’s strengthen your paragraph focusing on clarity, unity, and coherence.

**Guiding Steps:**
1. **Relevance:**  
Does every sentence directly support the new topic sentence and your thesis about citizens influencing government?

2. **Explanation:**  
Do you clearly show *how* citizens create change, and why it’s sometimes difficult?

3. **Transitions:**  
Are your ideas linked smoothly?

**Your Turn:**  
Choose *one* sentence from this paragraph that you think could be clearer or more detailed. For example, you might pick:
- “But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well.”

Would you like to revise that sentence to make it clearer and connect it back to the paragraph’s key idea (the limits of citizen influence)?  
If yes, try rewriting it—remember you can use more precise vocabulary and connect it to your main argument.

Let me know your revision—or ask for a hint if you need help!
