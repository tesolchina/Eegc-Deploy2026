            ## Contribution Analysis

            You've made solid progress on your essay revisions and your engagement with the AI guidance has strengthened your writing significantly.

**To help you complete and polish the first body paragraph and continue improvements, here are some specific, balanced suggestions you can apply:**

---

### 1. Replace “macro decision-making” and “high-level decision-making”  
These phrases are a bit vague and less common in academic writing about policy. More precise terms are:  
- *government decision-making*  
- *policy-making*  
- *legislative processes*  

Example revision:  
> Under public pressure, the government is often more likely to take corresponding actions, which precisely reflects the influence of individual actions on **government decision-making**.

---

### 2. Refine “united voices”  
“United voices” sounds a little informal or vague. Consider:  
- *collective advocacy*  
- *coordinated public campaigns*  
- *united public demands*  

Example:  
> …the public has successfully prompted leaders to introduce new regulations targeting plastic pollution or reducing carbon emissions through **collective advocacy**.

---

### 3. Improve transitions and flow  
Use linking words to guide the reader through your argument, especially transitioning between positive outcomes and challenges:  
- *Moreover,*  
- *However,*  
- *Nevertheless,*  
- *Despite these successes,*  

Example for introducing limitations:  
> **However,** this mechanism does not always operate perfectly: sometimes the government only makes symbolic responses without taking substantive measures. **Moreover,** although the public sometimes wishes to drive change, their demands fail to reach the decision-making level due to insufficient channels for effective communication.

---

### 4. Clarify explanations for limitations  
Make it clearer why collective action might fail:  
> …due to **insufficient channels for public engagement** or **lack of government transparency and responsiveness**.

---

### 5. Minor phrasing and conciseness improvements  
Try to be direct and concise:  
- “the government is more likely to pass new laws” rather than “the government’s willingness and motivation to promote relevant legislation usually increase.”  
- “individual power is limited” is fine, but “public opinion and collective actions can still have significant impact” is a strong emphasis.

---

### 6. Example revised first body paragraph draft excerpt (for illustration only, feel free to adapt):  

> One important measure that individuals can take in addressing climate change is to influence government decision-making through collective action. Under public pressure, governments are more likely to take corresponding actions. For instance, when leaders proposing environmental protection policies enjoy strong public support, the government is more likely to enact relevant legislation. In several countries, collective advocacy has successfully prompted leaders to introduce new regulations targeting plastic pollution and reducing carbon emissions. This demonstrates that although individual power may be limited, public opinion and collective efforts can have a significant impact on governmental policies.  
>  
> **However,** this process does not always function effectively. Sometimes, governments respond symbolically without implementing substantive measures. **Moreover,** despite public willingness to drive change, demands often fail to reach decision-makers due to insufficient channels for public engagement and a lack of government transparency.

---

### Next Steps:
1. You can now revise your first body paragraph’s supporting sentences by incorporating some or all of these ideas for clarity, flow, and academic tone.  
2. When ready, share your revised paragraph for feedback.  
3. Then we can select either the second body paragraph or the conclusion for the next revision, as per your preference, to complete the essay revision cycle.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today. While many argue that governments and corporations hold greater sway in tackling climate change due to their organizational power and resources, we must firmly believe that individual contributions—whether manifested through influencing public policies or adopting sustainable lifestyle choices—also play an indispensable role in combating this global crisis.

One important measure that individuals can take in addressing climate change is to influence macro decisions by participating in collective actions.Under public pressure, the government is often more likely to take corresponding actions, which precisely reflects the influence of individual actions on macro decision-making. For instance, when leaders who propose environmental protection policies enjoy high public support rates, the government’s willingness and motivation to promote relevant legislation usually increase. In some countries, the public has successfully prompted leaders to introduce new regulations targeting plastic pollution or reducing carbon emissions through united voices. This indicates that even if individual power is limited, the public opinion and collective actions that come together can still have a significant impact on high-level decision-making. Of course, this mechanism does not always operate perfectly: sometimes the government only makes symbolic responses without taking substantive measures; On the other hand, although the public sometimes has the willingness to drive change, their demands fail to reach the decision-making level due to the lack of effective channels for expression.
On the other hand, individuals can directly contribute by adopting sustainable daily practices. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-06T05:11:48.812Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-06T05:12:38.758Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement:

> I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

Let’s start with some feedback to help you revise it:

**Clarity:** Your thesis makes your position clear, but it’s a bit long and could be more direct. The parts about citizens influencing government and the role of personal choices might be easier to understand if you organize them more clearly.

**Strength:** The phrase “I partly agree” is fine for a point-of-view essay, but using more decisive language will make your argument stronger. Try to avoid wording like “I also think that…” as it can sound uncertain.

**Focus & Structure:** To improve structure, briefly state the two main points you plan to discuss (influencing government, and the role of personal choices). This helps the reader know what to expect in your essay.

**Confident Language:** Use direct statements instead of “I think” or “maybe.”

**Try this approach:**  
- Clearly answer the essay question: Do individual actions matter compared to governments/companies?
- Preview your main reasons: Influence on government, and personal choices.
- Use confident, academic vocabulary.

**Would you like to try rewriting the thesis statement now using those tips? Let me know if you’d like an example or any more suggestions!**

*Time:* 2025-11-06T05:12:43.138Z

**You:** In this regard, I think the measures taken by individuals and large companies are equally important

*Time:* 2025-11-06T05:15:22.010Z

**Assistant:** Great—I can see you’ve made an attempt to revise your thesis statement:

"In this regard, I think the measures taken by individuals and large companies are equally important."

Let’s look at it together:

**What’s working:**
- You have clarified your point of view—you see both individuals and large companies as important.
- The statement is now more concise.

**What could be improved:**
- The phrase “I think” weakens your statement; aim for a more confident, academic tone.
- “Equally important” is clear, but the prompt asks specifically about the value of individual actions versus the actions of governments and companies.
- Try to specify *how* individuals contribute (e.g., by influencing governments and through their own actions), so your essay’s structure is clear.

**Guiding Questions for Revision:**
- Can you remove “I think” and state your viewpoint more directly?
- How can you mention the two main ways individuals make a difference (influencing governments, and making personal choices)?
- Can you ensure the thesis previews the essay’s structure (your two key points)?

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try revising your thesis again with these ideas in mind? Here’s a possible structure to help you:

"While the actions of governments and companies are vital in addressing climate change, individual contributions—both by influencing policies and through personal lifestyle choices—also play a significant role."

**But remember**—try to put this in your own words first! Would you like to give it another try?

*Time:* 2025-11-06T05:15:27.490Z

**You:** Although the actions of governments and companies play a powerful organizational role in addressing climate change, the contributions of individuals - whether through influencing policies or through personal lifestyle choices - also play an indispensable part in the fight against climate change.

*Time:* 2025-11-06T05:17:17.983Z

**Assistant:** Excellent work! Your revised thesis is much stronger. Here’s some targeted feedback:

**Strengths:**
- You now make a confident, direct statement—great academic tone!
- The thesis clearly answers the question about the importance of individual actions versus those of governments and companies.
- You preview the essay’s structure by mentioning both influencing policy and personal lifestyle choices.

**Minor Suggestions:**
- Consider using slightly more concise language (for example, “individuals contribute both by influencing policies and making personal choices”)—but your current version is absolutely appropriate for your level and purpose.
- “Indispensable part” is a strong phrase and shows conviction—great job!

**Confirming Next Steps:**
Are you satisfied with this revised thesis statement?  
Or would you like to adjust anything before we move on to revising a body paragraph?

Once you confirm you’re happy with your thesis, please tell me which body paragraph you’d like to work on next—the first or second. Then, share the topic sentence of that paragraph so we can revise it together!

*Time:* 2025-11-06T05:17:21.975Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

*Time:* 2025-11-06T05:17:59.921Z

**Assistant:** Great! You’ve chosen to work on the **first body paragraph**, and your topic sentence is:

> The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

Let’s review your topic sentence:

**What’s working:**
- You directly state the central idea for the paragraph.
- There is a clear focus on how individuals can contribute.

**What could be improved:**
- Now that your thesis highlights both influencing policy and personal choices, it would be good for this topic sentence to connect clearly back to your updated thesis statement.
- Phrases like “the most important way” can sound a bit absolute—if your essay recognizes a few different important ways, you might want to keep the language a bit more balanced.
- Consider mentioning “government policies/laws” rather than just politicians to sound more academic and focused.

**Tips:**
- Aim to echo the words or ideas from your new thesis, especially about *influencing policy*.
- Use academic vocabulary, such as “influence government policies” instead of “help fight climate change.”

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does this topic sentence clearly relate to your revised thesis, especially the part about influencing government or policy?
- Can you make it a little more precise or academic in phrasing?

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try revising this topic sentence now, using these suggestions?  
If you want, I can provide a simple model to help you—but I encourage you to try first in your own words!

*Time:* 2025-11-06T05:18:04.778Z

**You:** Do you have any suggestions

*Time:* 2025-11-06T05:18:31.885Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely, I’m here to guide—and you’re doing great by staying engaged with the process!

Let’s recap your updated thesis:  
Your thesis now clearly states that, while government and company actions are vital for fighting climate change, individuals also play a significant role both by influencing policy and making personal choices.

Let’s work with your original topic sentence:
> The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

Here’s how you might improve it:

**Guiding suggestions:**
- Try to use language that closely connects to the idea of “influencing government policies” (from your thesis).
- Avoid calling it “the most important way” (since your essay discusses at least two key ways).
- Be confident and specific, but a bit more measured in your claim.

**Examples you can use for inspiration:**
- “One significant way individuals can address climate change is by influencing government policy through collective action.”
- “Individuals make a powerful impact on climate change when they work together to shape government decisions.”

**Your turn!**
Would you like to try revising your topic sentence using these hints?  
Focus on showing that influencing government is a key channel for individual action, and mirror the confident tone of your new thesis. I’m happy to give more feedback or provide another example if you need!

*Time:* 2025-11-06T05:18:36.934Z

**You:** One important measure that individuals can take in addressing climate change is to influence macro decisions by participating in collective actions.

*Time:* 2025-11-06T05:20:03.613Z

**Assistant:** Well done! You’ve revised your topic sentence to:

> One important measure that individuals can take in addressing climate change is to influence macro decisions by participating in collective actions.

**What’s working:**

- Good use of confident language—“one important measure” is balanced and fits well with your essay’s structure.
- You mention “influencing macro decisions,” which suggests policy/government level, addressing the thesis point.
- “Participating in collective actions” is a strong, academic phrase showing how individuals can contribute.

**Suggestions for further improvement:**

- Consider using “government decisions” or “government policies” instead of “macro decisions” for clearer academic vocabulary, since “macro decisions” can sound a bit vague.
- You could specify what types of collective action (such as voting, protesting, petitioning), but the sentence is already clear for a topic sentence.

**Guiding questions:**

- Would you like to clarify “macro decisions” with “government decisions” or “government policies”?
- Are you satisfied with this topic sentence, or do you want to adjust it for more clarity?

Let me know if you’d like to make any edits. If you’re happy with this version, we can move on to revising the supporting sentences in the rest of this paragraph!

(Just reply with your final topic sentence, and then paste the rest of the first body paragraph so we can proceed.)

*Time:* 2025-11-06T05:20:08.888Z

**You:** On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter.

*Time:* 2025-11-06T05:20:30.227Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing that part of your second body paragraph. Since we are working step-by-step, let’s focus back on the paragraph you chose for revision—which is your **first body paragraph** (the one about influencing government).

To move forward, please:

1. Confirm your revised topic sentence for the **first body paragraph** (e.g., your recent version: “One important measure that individuals can take in addressing climate change is to influence government decisions by participating in collective actions.” Or another version if you’d like to adjust it).
2. Copy and paste the rest of the **first body paragraph** (everything after the topic sentence) here.

We’ll then work together to revise the supporting sentences of this first body paragraph for clarity, unity, and coherence, making sure everything fits your new topic sentence and thesis.

**Ready?** Please provide:
- Your finalized topic sentence for the first body paragraph.
- The rest of the supporting sentences from that paragraph.

Once you share these, we’ll proceed by examining and improving those supporting details!

*Time:* 2025-11-06T05:20:36.132Z

**You:** One important measure that individuals can take in addressing climate change is to influence macro decisions by participating in collective actions.

*Time:* 2025-11-06T06:16:00.499Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! Here’s your revised topic sentence:

> One important measure that individuals can take in addressing climate change is to influence macro decisions by participating in collective actions.

Since we’ve discussed updating “macro decisions” to “government decisions” or “government policies” for clarity, you can consider that, but let’s continue with revision as is for now.

**Next step:**  
Please paste the rest of your first body paragraph—the sentences that come after your topic sentence.  
We’ll look closely at how your supporting details relate to this new topic sentence, and make sure they are unified, clear, and coherent.

Here was your original first body paragraph (excluding the topic sentence):

> When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

Let’s analyze and revise these supporting sentences step by step.

---

### 1. Do all your supporting details clearly connect to your revised topic sentence (“influence macro [government] decisions by participating in collective actions”)?

- Yes, most sentences provide examples (protests, voting) and explanation about how collective action can influence government.

---

### 2. Are there any places that could be made more clear or academic?

- “normal people” might sound informal; consider “ordinary citizens” or “members of the public.”
- “maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action” could be clearer and use more precise language.
- Clarify how collective actions sometimes do **not** work—make this explicit but concise.

---

### 3. Do you repeat ideas or have sentences that can be better connected?

- You mention protests, voting, public pressure—but might want to group examples, then explain their positive and potential negative outcomes for better unity.
- The final two sentences about government not acting could be connected more logically to the rest.

---

### Guiding Questions

- Can you clarify how collective actions have both succeeded and sometimes failed to influence government policy?
- Do you want to explain why sometimes collective actions are less effective (e.g., lack of communication, government reluctance)?

### Now, Try Revising!
Go ahead and rewrite the supporting sentences of this paragraph, making sure to:

- Use academic vocabulary where possible.
- Keep your focus: everything should support the idea that individuals, by acting together, can influence government decisions on climate.
- Make sure each sentence flows logically from the last.

**You:** Under public pressure, the government is often more likely to take corresponding actions, which precisely reflects the influence of individual actions on macro decision-making. For instance, when leaders who propose environmental protection policies enjoy high public support rates, the government's willingness and motivation to promote relevant legislation usually increase. In some countries, the public has successfully prompted leaders to introduce new regulations targeting plastic pollution or reducing carbon emissions through joint voices. This indicates that even if individual power is limited, the public opinion and collective actions that come together can still have a significant impact on high-level decision-making. Of course, this mechanism does not always operate perfectly: sometimes the government only makes symbolic responses without taking substantive measures; On the other hand, although the public sometimes has the willingness to drive change, their demands fail to reach the decision-making level due to the lack of effective channels for expression.

**Assistant:** Fantastic work revising your supporting sentences! Let’s walk through the strengths and areas for refinement, following our structured process:

---

### **Strengths:**
- **Unity:** All supporting sentences relate well to your topic sentence about influencing government decisions through collective action.
- **Clarity & Academic Tone:** You use more academic language (“corresponding actions,” “public opinion,” “substantive measures,” “mechanism”), and your structure is clear and logical.
- **Evidence/Examples:** You give specific evidence, such as public support for environmental leaders, new regulations, and the impact of collective actions.
- **Balanced Perspective:** You mention both successes and limitations, showing critical analysis.

---

### **Suggestions for Refinement:**

- **Precision:** "Macro decision-making" can still be specified as "government decision-making" for extra clarity.
- **Transitions:** Try adding or strengthening transitional phrases for smoother flow. For example, “For instance” is good, but using "Moreover," "However," "In addition," can help link ideas smoothly.
- **Explanation Expansion:** The last sentence about demands failing to reach decision-makers due to communication issues could be a little clearer—maybe briefly state why channels aren’t effective.
- **Vocabulary:** "Joint voices" could be replaced by "collective advocacy" or "public campaigns" for greater clarity.

---

### **Questions for You:**

- Do you feel that each sentence clearly supports your main idea about collective action, or is there any part you’d like to expand or clarify?
- Would you like to refine any phrases for a smoother academic style?
- Is your explanation about limited impact (symbolic response, ineffective communication) clear enough for your reader to understand the challenges?

---

### **Guided Suggestions (not full rewrites):**
- Consider specifying “government decisions” instead of “macro decision-making” for clarity.
- To describe ineffective communication, you could mention, “due to insufficient channels for public engagement or lack of government transparency.”
- "Joint voices" might be clearer as “by uniting their voices” or “through coordinated public campaigns.”

**You:** On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter.

**Assistant:** You’ve made strong progress revising your first body paragraph—well done! Now, let’s focus on the **supporting sentences**, following the guidance above, to make your ideas extra clear and unified with your revised topic sentence.

#### Here are your revised supporting sentences again:

> Under public pressure, the government is often more likely to take corresponding actions, which precisely reflects the influence of individual actions on macro decision-making. For instance, when leaders who propose environmental protection policies enjoy high public support rates, the government’s willingness and motivation to promote relevant legislation usually increase. In some countries, the public has successfully prompted leaders to introduce new regulations targeting plastic pollution or reducing carbon emissions through united voices. This indicates that even if individual power is limited, the public opinion and collective actions that come together can still have a significant impact on high-level decision-making. Of course, this mechanism does not always operate perfectly: sometimes the government only makes symbolic responses without taking substantive measures; On the other hand, although the public sometimes has the willingness to drive change, their demands fail to reach the decision-making level due to the lack of effective channels for expression.

### **Feedback and Revision Guidance**

**What’s working well:**
- The paragraph clearly supports the topic sentence about influencing government through collective action.
- You use good academic vocabulary, and your examples of public pressure (e.g., legislation on plastic, carbon emissions) are effective.
- Balanced analysis (successes and challenges) strengthens your critical thinking.

**Areas to refine:**

1. **Consistency/Vocabulary:**  
   - Consider replacing “macro decision-making” and “high-level decision-making” with “government decision-making” for clearer academic tone and consistency.
   - “United voices” could be “collective advocacy” or “public campaigns.”

2. **Transitions/Flow:**  
   - Connect sentences more smoothly (e.g., use transition words like "Moreover," "However," "Additionally").
   - The move from examples of impact to the limitations could be clearer.

3. **Clarity/Conciseness:**  
   - “The government’s willingness and motivation to promote relevant legislation usually increase” could be more direct (e.g., “the government is more likely to pass new laws”).
   - The final sentence about lack of effective channels could specify why communication sometimes fails.

---

### **Guided Questions for Further Self-Revision**

- Do your supporting sentences always use the same terminology as your thesis and topic sentence? (e.g., "government decision-making")
- Is it clear when you’re discussing successes versus limitations?
- Are there any places where two sentences could be merged or one idea expanded for more clarity?
- Can you explain one cause of “lack of effective channels” to show deeper analysis?

---

**Now, would you like to try:**
- Revising some of these sentences using the above advice?
- Replacing phrases like "macro decision-making" or "united voices"?
- Adding a short transition at the start of the "limitations" section for smoother flow?

Just try editing a few words or sentences! If you’d like, ask for my feedback or for a sample phrase using your original ideas—remember, I won’t provide a full rewrite.

Let me know when your new version is ready, or if you’d like further hints! Your work is already showing strong growth in clarity and structure.
