            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for sharing your revision focus and the chat history! Here’s a consolidated summary based on the assessment, your interaction, and suggested next steps:

---

**SUMMARY OF ESSAY PROGRESS AND AI INTERACTION**

Your essay improved notably from the original to the revised draft, especially in:

- **Thesis clarity and confidence:** A stronger, clearer thesis that states the main claim and affected group.
- **Paragraph development:** More detailed topic sentences and specific examples of affected job types.
- **Grammar and vocabulary:** Fewer errors, improved phrasing and diction.

You took the AI’s guidance well by selecting a focus area (evidence and development) and working on revising the thesis and paragraph. Your engagement was focused and purposeful, following the proposed three-step revision plan.

---

**AREAS TO PRIORITIZE FOR FUTURE REVISION**

1. **Add Concrete Evidence:**  
   Your claims would be much stronger with real-world data, statistics, or examples (e.g., citing automation impact in automotive factories or referencing industry reports on job losses/gains). This makes your argument more persuasive and academic.

2. **Strengthen Transitions and Conciseness:**  
   Replace phrases like “On another side” with smoother connectors (“Conversely,” “However”) and fix punctuation spacing issues (e.g., “cost,because” → “cost, because”). This will improve flow and readability.

3. **Introduce and Respond to a Counterargument:**  
   Briefly acknowledge that automation may create new skilled jobs, then explain why this does not offset the losses for most workers. This critical engagement deepens the essay’s sophistication.

4. **Iterative Revision:**  
   Continue revising in cycles—add evidence, polish transitions, improve phrasing—then seek feedback again. Iteration builds precision and depth.

---

**AI COLLABORATION AND REVISION STRATEGY**

- You used AI suggestions effectively and implemented revisions independently.  
- For deeper improvement, try actively debating or questioning AI feedback to sharpen your critical thinking and collaboration skills (e.g., “I see your point about adding evidence, but I’m unsure which source to trust; can you suggest reputable data?”).  
- Document your thought process during revisions (acceptances, rejections) to demonstrate reflective learning.

---

**NEXT STEPS**

- Draft a new paragraph or two adding at least one specific, credible example or statistic about automation’s impact on jobs.  
- Ask the AI to help generate or evaluate evidence-based paragraphs or sentences supporting your claims.  
- Request refinements on transitions and phrasing for naturalness and clarity.  
- Practice writing a brief counterargument plus rebuttal paragraph.

---

If you want, I can help you draft an evidence paragraph or model a counterargument next. Just let me know how you’d like to proceed!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The original presents a clear position (automation harms employment) but ideas are underdeveloped and repetitive. Example: "automation technologies weaken global employment prospect... First,automation can replace traditional  labor..." claims are asserted without supporting evidence.
- Organization: 17/25 - Basic intro-body-conclusion structure exists, but paragraphs are repetitive and transitions are weak ("In another aspect..." repeats earlier points).
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Limited range and frequent word-choice problems (e.g., "employer who do not have professional technologies and knowledge", "lies on globalization").
- Grammar: 14/25 - Frequent punctuation, article, number-agreement and word-formation errors that impede clarity (e.g., missing spaces/punctuation, "proffessional", "it undermine global employment prospect").
- **Original Essay Total: 64/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised draft clarifies the argument and adds concrete types of affected jobs ("assembly line work, quality inspection, and metal processing") and clearer causal claims (cost incentives for firms). It still lacks concrete data or real-world examples but reasoning is stronger.
- Organization: 21/25 - Paragraph structure is clearer and the sequence of ideas (thesis → substitution effects → limited gains for skilled workers → conclusion) reads logically. Transitions improved ("On another side", "Overall"), though a few connectors could be tightened.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Vocabulary choice and word forms are improved ("diminish their competitiveness", "maintenance, optimization, or development"), though a few collocations and small errors remain (e.g., "capable working for 24/7", punctuation spacing).
- Grammar: 20/25 - Many grammatical errors were corrected and sentence clarity improved. Some remaining issues: punctuation spacing ("cost,because"), occasional awkward phrasing ("It is widely believed that, for the global workforce as a whole, automation exerts a detrimental impact") and minor article/word-order problems.
- **Revised Essay Total: 82/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +18 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis clarified and made more confident: revised to "Automation technologies undermine global employment prospects, especially for those workers who lack professional skills and specialized knowledge."
  - Topic sentence and paragraph development improved: e.g., "First, automation can replace traditional laborers and diminish their competitiveness in the global job market." and expansion with specific task examples ("assembly line work, quality inspection, and metal processing").
  - Grammar, sentence clarity, and vocabulary choices strengthened overall (fewer distracting errors; more precise verbs and nouns).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Provide concrete evidence or data (statistics, studies, or specific industry examples) to support claims—this would move the essay from plausible argument to persuasive evidence-based claim.
  - Tighten transitions and phrasing in a few places (e.g., replace "On another side" with "Conversely" or "However"; fix punctuation like "cost,because").
  - Add a brief, explicit counterargument/nuance (e.g., long-term job creation in new sectors) and a rebuttal to strengthen critical engagement.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 7** (assistant initial guidance → user question → assistant guidance → user reports edits → assistant offers further guidance → user selects focus → assistant begins Step 1)
- **Conversation Quality:** Focused and task-oriented. The assistant provided a clear revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph). The student engaged by asking how to revise, reporting they made grammar fixes, and selecting a focus area ("Evidence and development"). Interaction shows direction-setting but limited iterative revision cycles.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - The chat contains a moderate number of turns (7) with relevant questions and targeted guidance. The exchange shows purposeful direction-setting but lacks extended back-and-forth or multiple rounds of revision.
  - Evidence: assistant outlined a three-step revision workflow and the student selected "Evidence and development"; however, the chat ends early in Step 1 without multiple cycles.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 - The student accepted guidance to revise and selected a focus area, but there is limited textual evidence that the student critically evaluated or rejected specific AI suggestions. The student did not, for example, argue for alternative approaches or explicitly weigh options.
  - Evidence: user: "I changed my essay end rectify some grammar mistake,tell me if there are anything can improve" and later chose "Evidence and development" as the focus, but did not challenge or evaluate particular revision recommendations.
- **Refining Process**: 3/5 - There is some revision activity (student produced a revised essay and corrected grammar), indicating an iterative process, but only one clear revision cycle is shown. The assistant's structured steps were followed partially but not through multiple iterations.
  - Evidence: assistant proposed Step 1–3; the student revised and reported edits; chat shows move into thesis revision but not additional rounds improving evidence or paragraph drafting.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 9/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clearer thesis and argument in the revised draft (evidence: first sentence of revised essay).
- Improved organization and paragraph unity—topic sentences better match paragraph content (evidence: revised first paragraph's topic sentence and the listing of affected tasks).
- Active use of AI guidance: student followed a structured revision plan and implemented grammar and structural changes in the revised essay.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Support claims with specific, credible evidence (studies, statistics, industry examples) to strengthen persuasive impact.
- Continue iterative revision: request targeted examples, ask the AI for model evidence paragraphs or linking sentences, and rework based on feedback.
- Eliminate remaining grammar/punctuation errors and improve some collocations for naturalness ("capable working for 24/7" → "capable of operating 24/7"; "On another side" → "Conversely/On the other hand").

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the draft and indicated specific goals ("I changed my essay... tell me if there are anything can improve"; later selected "Evidence and development"). The assistant also provided a revision plan.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student followed a plan and selected a focus area; the AI gave a clear stepwise process.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Developing/Good - The student made choices about focus and implemented revisions, but there is limited explicit critique of AI suggestions in the chat history.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The student applied edits to thesis, topic sentence, and paragraphs independently, as seen in the revised essay.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Add concrete evidence: integrate at least one statistic, study, or real-world example (e.g., automation in automotive factories, robotics in manufacturing) to support claims and cite the source or describe it briefly.
2. Request iterative help: run at least two more revision cycles with the AI—(a) revise paragraph with added evidence, (b) polish transitions and phrasing—so feedback can be applied incrementally.
3. Focus on precision in phrasing and punctuation: ask the AI to proofread for collocations, prepositions, and punctuation spacing; practice rewriting sentences that remain awkward for naturalness.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student followed the AI coach’s three-step plan and implemented clear improvements to thesis, topic sentence, and body paragraph—this is strong evidence of applying guided revision.
- Encourage the student to practice adding evidence and counterargument/rebuttal to meet higher-level expectations for academic argumentation.
- The chat history shows appropriate use of AI as a coach; to demonstrate stronger collaboration skills, ask the student to document subsequent revision iterations and to justify acceptance or rejection of AI suggestions in the chat (this will support higher marks in the Human-AI rubric).

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
In my opinion,automation technologies weaken global employment prospect,especially for those employer who do not have professional technologies and knowledge.
First,automation can replace traditional  labor and reduce their competitive edge in global employment.In the past,traditional labor owns competitive edge in global employment because of the low salary.Although the cost of automation machine is expensive,for long terms,it can reduce the cost of production.Moreover,traditional labor can only keep working for a few hours.However,the automatic machine can work all day,the managers should only pay for electricity cost and repair cost to maintain the machine working.It means they should only pay lower money to run the industry more efficiently.On the whole,automation brings higher efficiency and lower manage and employment cost,industry no longer lies on globalization to decrease the cost,it undermine global employment prospect.
In another aspect,automation is beneficial to those people who owns proffessional knowledge about automation that will enhance relative group’s employment prospect.They have more chance to involve in the jobs about repairing,optimizing or invention for automatic machine.However it only beneficial to a few population,most people,especially in developing countries they lies traditional labour to survive,will lose their job positions gradually.It is believe that for entire population,automation undermine the global employment prospect.
On the whole,in my opinion automatic technology shift only brings benefit for people who works for technological industry.And this shift will make a huge damages for traditional labors global employment prospect.

Revised:
Automation technologies undermine global employment prospects, especially for those workers who lack professional skills and specialized knowledge.
First, automation can replace traditional laborers and diminish their competitiveness in the global job market. In the past, traditional laborers held a competitive edge globally due to their relatively low wages. Although the upfront cost of automation equipment is substantial, in the long run, it can significantly cut down production costs,because human workers need benefits,wages and training.Moreover, human workers can only sustain work for a limited number of hours, whereas automated machines are capable working for 24/7 and without mood swings and fatigue. Managers only need to cover electricity and maintenance costs to keep the machines running. In addition, repetitive labor positions such as assembly line work, quality inspection, and metal processing have been drastically reduced, as automated machines are clearly more proficient at performing these tasks.Overall, automation delivers higher efficiency and lowers management and labor costs. Industries no longer need to rely on globalization as a means to reduce costs, which in turn undermines global employment prospects.
On another side, automation favors individuals who possess professional knowledge in this field, as it enhances their employment prospects. These skilled workers have greater opportunities to secure jobs related to the maintenance, optimization, or development of automated machinery. However, such benefits only apply to a small segment of the population. The majority of people—particularly those in developing countries who depend on traditional labor to make a living—will gradually lose their jobs. It is widely believed that, for the global workforce as a whole, automation exerts a detrimental impact on employment prospects.
In conclusion,the shift toward automation technologies only benefits workers in the technology sector. Conversely, this transition will inflict severe harm on the global employment prospects of traditional laborers.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-06T18:20:22.602Z

**You:** How to revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-12-06T18:21:20.334Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’d love to help. Before we start revising, let’s do two quick things so our session is focused and useful.

1) Your goals
Tell me which of these you most want to improve in this essay (pick up to two):
- Clarity of thesis and argument
- Organization and paragraph structure
- Topic sentences and paragraph unity
- Evidence and development (examples, explanation)
- Grammar, word choice, and sentence-level correctness
- Style and academic tone

2) Quick diagnostic (short and clear)
I read your draft. Here’s a brief diagnosis using four rubric areas:

- Thesis & Argument
  Strengths: You take a clear position (automation harms global employment for most people).
  Needs work: The thesis is unclear and contains grammar errors; it doesn’t preview specific main points cleanly.

- Organization
  Strengths: There is a clear intro-body-conclusion structure.
  Needs work: Paragraphs are repetitive; transitions and logical progression between ideas need tightening.

- Evidence & Development
  Strengths: You use reasoned points (cost savings for firms; jobs for skilled workers).
  Needs work: Claims lack concrete examples or data; explanations are often vague or repetitive.

- Language Use
  Strengths: Meaning can be inferred in many places.
  Needs work: Many grammar, word-choice, article, and punctuation errors distract the reader and weaken clarity.

3) Which issues should we focus on?
From the list above (or your own idea), which one or two weaknesses do you want to focus on in this session? Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 1: revising your thesis. If you want, I can also explain exactly what makes a strong thesis before you try revising it. Which would you prefer?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T18:21:29.901Z

**You:** I changed my essay end rectify some grammar mistake,tell me if there are anything can improve

*Time:* 2025-12-06T18:27:08.530Z

**Assistant:** Nice work—your revised draft is much clearer and the grammar improvements help. Before we begin the three-step revision, let’s pick targets so our time is focused.

1) Pick up to two things you most want to work on from this list:
- Clarity of thesis and argument
- Organization and paragraph structure
- Topic sentences and paragraph unity
- Evidence and development (examples, explanation)
- Grammar, word choice, and sentence-level correctness
- Style and academic tone

Which one or two would you like to focus on?

2) Quick note about your thesis (so you know what I’ll look for)
A strong thesis should:
- Clearly answer the question (agree/disagree/partly) in one confident sentence.
- Preview the main reasons or the essay structure (2–3 main points).
- Use precise language without hedging.

Your current thesis sentence in the revised draft reads:
"In my opinion, automation technologies undermine global employment prospects, especially for those workers who lack professional skills and specialized knowledge."

Brief feedback on that thesis:
- Strengths: Clear stance and an important qualifier (who is affected).
- What to improve: It could preview the main reasons (e.g., job substitution and limited benefits for most workers) so readers know the essay’s structure. Also remove “In my opinion” to sound more confident and academic.

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now with those ideas in mind? Try one sentence that:
- States your position confidently (no “In my opinion”),
- Signals 2–3 reasons you’ll discuss (e.g., cost-driven replacement, limited new jobs for most people),
- Is concise.

If you want, I can first show one quick example model after you try. Which would you prefer: try it yourself first, or see a suggested model?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T18:27:18.606Z

**You:** Evidence and development (examples, explanation)

*Time:* 2025-12-06T18:30:25.305Z

**Assistant:** Great — focusing on evidence and development is a useful choice. Now let’s begin Step 1 (thesis revision).

Your current thesis:
"Automation technologies undermine global employment prospects, especially for those workers who lack professional skills and specialized knowledge."

Quick feedback (short and focused)
- Strengths: clear position; identifies who is most affected.
- What to improve: make it more confident (drop phrases like “In my opinion” if present), and preview the main reasons you will discuss (so readers know the essay’s structure). Right now it says who is affected but not why or how—add 2–3 concise reasons (e.g., job substitution, cost incentives for firms, limited new jobs only for skilled workers).

Hints for rewriting
- One sentence, confident tone.
- Include 2–3 specific reasons or the essay’s structure.
- Keep it concise (one strong sentence).

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? If you want, I can show one brief model after you give it a try. Which do you prefer?
