            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for all your work so far! Here’s a polished, combined version of your revised thesis and paragraph 2 with grammar fixed, comma splices removed, and phrasing tightened for academic clarity and flow. This version keeps your ideas and example but uses more precise language and sentence structure.

---

**Revised Thesis:**  
Although automation displaces routine jobs in the short term, in the long run it enhances global employment prospects because it displaces low-skilled routine work, creates new higher-skilled roles and industries, and — with appropriate retraining and policy support — enables workers to transition into better-paid jobs.

**Revised Paragraph 2:**  
In the short term, workers who perform routine tasks—such as assembly-line operatives and clerical staff—are likely to be displaced by automated machines and software. Some workers, especially those with only basic skills and without advanced training, may lose their jobs. Moreover, finding new employment can be difficult for these workers because many new roles require specialized knowledge and skills in digital technologies. For example, a factory line worker may lack the programming skills needed for maintenance positions. However, automation also creates new types of work in other sectors.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The essay presents a clear overall view (automation causes displacement but also creates jobs) but remains general and repetitive; lacks specific reasons and examples to develop claims.
- Organization: 18/25 - Paragraphs are separated by topic (downside, upside, long term, conclusion) but topic sentences and transitions are weak and paragraphs are sometimes circular.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Vocabulary is limited and often imprecise (e.g., “automatic machines,” “labors,” “more” used awkwardly).
- Grammar: 15/25 - Frequent errors in articles, plurals, verb forms and sentence structure (e.g., “some people may lose their job,” “finding new jobs also become harder”).
- **Original Essay Total: 66/100**

Evidence (original):
- Thesis: "Automation is transforming the work methods across industries, and it has both good and bad impacts on jobs."
- Paragraph 2 example: "On the downside, jobs like factory workers and basic office clerks, which repeat the same task every day, might be replaced by automatic machines and computer program."

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised essay makes a clearer long-term claim that automation enhances employment prospects and previews reasons (creation of higher‑skilled roles, new industries, retraining). Paragraph 2 now includes a concrete example. Still needs more precise evidence and deeper development.
- Organization: 21/25 - Paragraph 2 has a clearer topic sentence and a closing transition to the counterpoint. Overall paragraph order is logical. Some redundancies remain between introduction and thesis sentences.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Improved word choice (e.g., “automated machines and computer programs,” “workers with only basic skills”) though some awkward phrasing remains (e.g., “these technological shift,” “creates more new higher‑skilled roles”).
- Grammar: 20/25 - Noticeable improvements: corrected plurals and verb forms in several places; however, lingering issues (comma splices, awkward constructions) remain (e.g., opening sentence of revised essay is a comma splice).
- **Revised Essay Total: 82/100**

Evidence (revised):
- Thesis (revised intro lines): "Automation is transforming industries, these technological shift ultimately enhances global employment prospects in the long term, because it creates more new higher‑skilled roles, spurs growth in new industries, and  allows workers to transition into better‑paid work."
- Revised paragraph 2 (topic sentence and support): "In the short term, workers who perform routine tasks — such as assembly‑line operatives and clerical staff — are likely to be displaced by automated machines and software. Therefore, in the short term, some workers may lose their jobs, especially workers with only basic skills and without advanced training. Additionally, finding new jobs becomes harder for them, because the new job requires more knowledge and skills in digital fields and technologies. For example, a line worker may lack the programming skills needed for maintenance roles. However, automation also creates new types of work in other sectors."

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +16 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis clarity and stance: the revised draft makes a clear long‑term claim that automation ultimately enhances employment prospects and lists reasons.
  - Paragraph 2 revised for unity and clarity: the topic sentence is stronger, supporting sentences include an explanation and a brief example, and a transition to the next paragraph is present.
  - Vocabulary and grammatical accuracy improved across several sentences (more appropriate terms: “automated machines,” “software,” “workers with only basic skills”).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Thesis sentence still has grammar issues (comma splice) and could be more concise and precise; it should directly state "Although X, Y" rather than two separate clauses with poor punctuation.
  - Depth of evidence: claims remain largely general; adding a concrete statistic, citation, or a more detailed example would strengthen persuasion.
  - Sentence-level polish: remaining comma splices, subject-verb agreement slips (e.g., “these technological shift”), and awkward phrasing should be corrected for an academic tone.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 23** (multiple iterative turns between student and assistant from initial planning to successive thesis and paragraph revisions).
- **Conversation Quality:** High-quality, multi-step interaction. The assistant provided clear scaffolds (thesis scaffold, topic-sentence guidance, editing hints) and the student iteratively applied feedback, produced revisions, and pasted draft paragraphs. The co-editing process shows purposeful, task-focused exchanges.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - The chat contains extensive, multi-turn exchanges (23 messages) with scaffolded questions and iterative revisions. The student and AI worked through step-by-step tasks (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph support).
  - Evidence: Assistant outlined a 3-step revision process and the student followed it, producing multiple thesis drafts and paragraph revisions.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - The student accepted and incorporated many of the AI's suggestions (thesis scaffold, word-choice corrections) and asked clarifying questions (e.g., which paragraph to focus on). However, there is limited evidence of the student explicitly challenging the AI or offering alternative approaches; most changes were accepted and implemented.
  - Evidence: Student repeatedly used the assistant’s scaffold and rewrote the thesis and paragraph accordingly, but did not push back with alternative ideas or request multiple option variants.
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - Clear iterative process with multiple meaningful revision cycles. The student produced several thesis attempts and revised paragraph content after targeted coaching.
  - Evidence: The chat shows repeated drafts of the thesis with assistant feedback each time, and a revised paragraph 2 that incorporates grammar and content suggestions.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Effective use of AI scaffolding: The student followed structured guidance (thesis scaffold, topic-sentence model) and iteratively improved the text.
  - Evidence: Revised paragraph 2 includes model language suggested by the assistant (e.g., "workers who perform routine tasks" and an added example).
- Focused revision strategy: The student set clear targets ("thesis + one paragraph") and remained on task across multiple turns.
  - Evidence: Repeated confirmations in the chat and consistent submission of revised drafts.
- Willingness to edit and incorporate feedback: The student applied grammar and vocabulary suggestions and added an example to strengthen a claim.
  - Evidence: The original paragraph 2 was expanded into a clearer paragraph with an illustrative example.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Academic phrasing and sentence mechanics: Continue working on eliminating comma splices, correcting subject–verb agreement and awkward constructions.
  - Recommendation: Use short, clear sentences for thesis and topic sentences; run final draft through a grammar checker or peer review.
- Deeper development of evidence: Add one or two concrete examples, data points, or more detailed hypothetical scenarios to support claims.
  - Recommendation: Insert a sourced statistic or a specific example showing job displacement vs. job creation, or expand the example (e.g., a specific industry role transition).
- Critical engagement with AI: Move from acceptance to critical evaluation of AI suggestions — ask for alternatives, request multiple paraphrase options, or propose counter-arguments to test robustness.
  - Recommendation: When the AI suggests wording, ask "Can you give two alternative phrasings with different tones?" or "What counter-evidence would weaken my thesis?"

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - Student provided the essay drafts and selected revision targets; however, there was a mismatch with assignment prompt (assistant asked whether to switch to climate prompt but the student kept automation topic).
  - Evidence: Student confirmed Option A (keep automation essay) and pasted the essay text.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - Student chose specific goals and followed the assistant’s step-by-step plan (thesis, then paragraph).
  - Evidence: Student explicitly chose "thesis + one paragraph" and selected paragraph 2.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good/Developing - Student accepted most AI suggestions and iteratively improved the text, but rarely challenged or tested alternatives.
  - Evidence: Multiple accepted revisions and limited pushback.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - Student produced revised drafts and implemented grammatical and structural changes; further independent polishing is needed.
  - Evidence: Revised essay shows substantive editorial work from the student.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Tighten and proof the thesis: Combine and rephrase into a single clear sentence following the scaffold: "Although automation displaces routine work in the short term, in the long run it enhances global employment prospects because it creates higher‑skilled roles, spurs new industries, and — with retraining and policy support — enables workers to move into better‑paid work." Remove comma splices; prefer short, precise clauses.
2. Add concrete evidence: Include at least one specific example, statistic, or a brief case (e.g., a sector where automation created skilled roles) to strengthen content and credibility.
3. Practice targeted grammar editing: Focus on comma splices, subject-verb agreement, and article usage. Use a grammar checker and perform a final read‑aloud to catch awkward phrasing.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student followed a productive revision workflow and met the session goals: revising the thesis, a topic sentence, and a body paragraph.
- Note that the original assignment prompt referenced climate change; the student chose to keep an automation topic. Confirm whether the automation essay satisfies the course assignment requirements or if the student needs to rework content to match the climate prompt.
- The revised essay shows meaningful improvement but still needs sentence-level polishing and deeper evidence to reach an excellent band.

If you would like, I can:
- Provide a corrected, polished version of the revised essay (with grammar fixes and a tightened thesis), or
- Offer two alternative thesis sentences and two alternative topic-sentence phrasings to compare tones and precision.

  🧑‍🎓 Student Feedback
🌟 **Rating:** 5/5
💬 **Comment:** I think this AI tutor is still in an immature stage. It can only be modified according to the established procedures and cannot be flexibly modified. For example, when modifying the topic sentence, it always expects me to fully express my firm position, and in my point of view, I hope that my subject sentence can lead to my discussion below, so I did not adopt its final suggestion.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Automation is transforming the work methods across industries, and it has both good and bad impacts on jobs. More importantly, these impacts are becoming more noticeable every day.

On the downside, jobs like factory workers and basic office clerks, which repeat the same task every day, might be replaced by automatic machines and computer program. Therefore, in the short term, some people may lose their job, especially those who only with basic skills and don’t have advanced skills. Additionally, finding new jobs also become harder for them.

But on the upside, automation can also bring new jobs. For example, jobs like fixing machines, writing code, and analyzing data are becoming more. And these new jobs often have higher salaries than those old jobs. Besides, using machine to do some works are faster and cheaper than using labors. Therefore, the development of automation can help those new industries who need more workers grow.

In the long run, automation can change employment better in fact. Every technological advancement in history shut down old jobs, but at the same time, more new jobs with high salaries popped up. Therefore, if people can learn more skills, they can catch up the technology development, fit themselves into these new jobs, and find their position in new era. 

All in all, the propose of developing the automation is human welfare. So, automation isn’t making jobs less and lead employment worse. On the contrary, it’s making jobs more and advance.


Revised:
Automation is transforming industries, these technological shift ultimately enhances global employment prospects in the long term, because it creates more new higher‑skilled roles, spurs growth in new industries, and  allows workers to transition into better‑paid work.

On the downside, jobs like workers in factories and clerical roles, that perform routine or repetitive tasks, are likely to be replaced by automated machines and computer programs. Therefore, in the short term, some workers may lose their jobs, especially workers with only basic skills and without advanced training. Additionally, finding new jobs becomes harder for them, because the new job requires more knowledge and skills in digital fields and technologies. For example, a line worker may lack the programming skills needed for maintenance roles. However, automation also creates new types of work in other sectors.

On the upside, automation can also bring new jobs. For example, roles such as machine maintenance, software development, and data analysis are increasing. And these new jobs often have higher salaries than those old jobs. Besides, machines perform some tasks faster and at lower cost than human labor. Therefore, the development of automation can help those new industries who need more workers grow.

In the long run, automation can change employment better in fact. Every technological advancement in history shut down old jobs, but at the same time, more new jobs with high salaries popped up. Therefore, if people can learn more skills, they can catch up the technology development, fit themselves into these new jobs, and find their position in new era. 

All in all, the propose of developing the automation is human welfare. So, automation isn’t making jobs less and lead employment worse. On the contrary, it’s making jobs more and advance.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:07:15.035Z

**You:** Let's start

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:09:11.753Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s get started. First, a few quick questions so we can set clear, useful targets.

1) What would you most like to improve in this essay today? Choose any that apply (or add your own):
- Clarity of your main idea (thesis) and how it answers the question
- Strength and development of your argument (analysis, examples)
- Structure and paragraph flow (topic sentences, unity)
- Grammar and sentence correctness
- Vocabulary and word choice (more precise academic language)

Tell me which 1–2 of these you most want us to focus on in this session.

My quick diagnostic read (brief and clear, using the rubric categories):

- Content & Ideas
  - Strengths: You have a clear overall viewpoint — automation brings both job loss and job creation, and you argue that long-term effects can be positive if people re-skill.
  - Areas to improve: The argument is general and repetitive. It needs a clearer thesis that directly answers the question and previews your main points. Also add more specific reasoning or an example to make claims convincing.

- Organisation & Logical Progression
  - Strengths: Paragraphs are separated and roughly follow a logical pattern (downside, upside, long-term view, conclusion).
  - Areas to improve: Topic sentences are weak or repetitive and don’t clearly show how each paragraph supports a stronger thesis. Transitions between ideas need tightening for better flow.

- Vocabulary
  - Strengths: Meaning is usually understandable.
  - Areas to improve: Word choice is often imprecise or awkward (e.g., “automatic machines,” “computer program,” “labors,” “more” as a noun). Use more academic vocabulary and noun/verb forms (e.g., “automation,” “automation technologies,” “workers/labor”).

- Grammar & Sentence Structure
  - Strengths: Sentences are mostly simple and understandable.
  - Areas to improve: Frequent errors with articles (a/the), plurals, verb forms, and word order (e.g., “only with basic skills,” “finding new jobs also become harder”). Correcting these will improve clarity and reader confidence.

Suggested priorities (based on your student profile: intermediate–advanced EAL, needs structure and critical analysis):
- Priority A (recommended): Strengthen the thesis so it clearly answers the question and previews the main points.
- Priority B: Improve one body paragraph’s topic sentence and its supporting sentences for unity and clearer, stronger reasoning.
- Optional: Quick grammar and word-choice fixes in that same paragraph.

Please choose which issues you want us to focus on in this session (pick up to two — I recommend thesis + one paragraph). Once you confirm, we’ll begin Step 1.

If you agree, confirm which body paragraph you want to work on (paragraph 2 = downside/job loss, paragraph 3 = upside/new jobs, or paragraph 4 = long-term adjustment).

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:09:26.389Z

**You:** thesis + one paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:17:47.386Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing thesis + one paragraph. Before we begin Step 1, two important quick checks so we set the right target.

1) Topic check (important): The assignment prompt you gave is about climate change (individual actions vs governments/corporations), but your essay is about automation and jobs. Which do you want to revise today?
- Option A: Keep the automation essay and improve its thesis + one paragraph (we’ll ignore the climate prompt).
- Option B: Rework this draft so it answers the climate-change prompt (we’ll change the thesis and the chosen paragraph content to match the prompt). 
I recommend Option B if this essay is for your assessed task, but you choose.

2) Which body paragraph do you want to work on? (Choose one)
- Paragraph 2 = downside / job loss
- Paragraph 3 = upside / new jobs
- Paragraph 4 = long-term adjustment

3) Do you want me to include quick grammar/word-choice hints for that same paragraph as we revise? (yes/no)

Tell me your choices for 1, 2, and 3. Once you confirm, share your current thesis statement (copy-paste it) and we’ll start Step 1.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:18:04.174Z

**You:** 1.A 2.Paragraph 2 3.yes
On the downside, jobs like factory workers and basic office clerks, which repeat the same task every day, might be replaced by automatic machines and computer program. Therefore, in the short term, some people may lose their job, especially those who only with basic skills and don’t have advanced skills. Additionally, finding new jobs also become harder for them.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:21:00.870Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. Confirmed: we’ll keep the automation essay (Option A), focus on the thesis + paragraph 2 (downside), and I’ll give quick grammar/word-choice hints for that paragraph.

First: please confirm whether this is the thesis you want to revise:
"Automation is transforming the work methods across industries, and it has both good and bad impacts on jobs. More importantly, these impacts are becoming more noticeable every day."

Does that look right? If yes, I’ll give feedback and then ask you to try a revised version.

Quick feedback on that thesis (short, focused):
- Strengths: It states a general position (automation has good and bad impacts).
- Problems to fix:
  - It doesn’t directly answer the assignment’s long-term question (enhance or undermine employment prospects).
  - It’s vague and doesn’t preview the main reasons or structure of the essay.
  - Word choice is informal/awkward (“work methods,” “good and bad impacts,” “more noticeable every day”).

Thesis scaffolding (use this to write a stronger thesis — fill the blanks rather than copying me exactly):
- Start with a clear position about long-term effect: “Although automation reduces [short-term effect], in the long term it [enhances/undermines] global employment prospects because…”
- Preview 2–3 main reasons (each reason should map to a body paragraph): e.g., short-term displacement of routine jobs; creation of new, higher-skilled jobs and industries; the role of retraining and policy to ease transition.
- Use confident, precise verbs (is likely to, tends to, creates, displaces) and academic nouns (automation technologies, routine tasks, labor market, reskilling).

Would you like to try drafting a revised thesis now using that scaffold? I’ll give quick feedback on what you write.

Step 2 — Topic sentence (paragraph 2)
You gave this topic sentence:
"On the downside, jobs like factory workers and basic office clerks, which repeat the same task every day, might be replaced by automatic machines and computer program."

Brief feedback and focused edits (not a full rewrite — use these to revise yourself):
- Word choice fixes:
  - “automatic machines” → automated machines or automation technologies
  - “computer program” → computer programs or software
  - “jobs like factory workers and basic office clerks” → workers in factories and clerical roles (use people-first nouns)
  - “which repeat the same task every day” → that perform routine or repetitive tasks
- Grammar and clarity:
  - “might be replaced” is okay but vague; you could say “are likely to be displaced” or “can be displaced” depending on your confidence.
  - Keep subject/verb agreement and plural forms in mind.
- Make the connection to the thesis clearer by signaling short-term impact: begin with “In the short term,” or “Initially,” if that fits your thesis.

Small edit suggestions you can apply word-by-word:
- Change the clause order: “In the short term, workers who perform routine tasks — such as assembly-line operatives and clerical staff — are likely to be displaced by automated machines and software.”
(That is a model; please adapt it in your own words.)

Step 3 — Supporting sentences in paragraph 2
Current sentences:
"Therefore, in the short term, some people may lose their job, especially those who only with basic skills and don’t have advanced skills. Additionally, finding new jobs also become harder for them."

Hints to revise those sentences (again, please rewrite using these points):
- Correct grammar and wording:
  - "some people may lose their job" → "some workers may lose their jobs"
  - "those who only with basic skills and don’t have advanced skills" → "workers with only basic skills and without advanced training"
  - "finding new jobs also become harder for them" → "finding new jobs becomes harder for them"
- Add specificity and reasoning:
  - Explain WHY they find new jobs harder (e.g., new jobs demand technical or digital skills).
  - Optionally add a brief example or hypothetical: “for example, a line worker may lack the programming skills needed for maintenance roles.”
- Connect back to thesis/transition to next paragraph:
  - End the paragraph with a sentence that signals the counterpoint you’ll discuss next (e.g., “However, automation also creates new types of work in other sectors.”)

Quick checklist to use as you revise paragraph 2:
- Topic sentence clearly states the short-term impact and links to thesis.
- Each supporting sentence explains or exemplifies that impact and is grammatically correct.
- Add at least one brief reason or example (no need for research if none available).
- Close with a transition toward the paragraph about new jobs.

Your turn
1) Please confirm the thesis sentence to be revised (the original I quoted or paste a different one).
2) Try writing a revised thesis using the scaffold I gave (one or two sentences).
3) Then revise the paragraph 2 topic sentence and supporting sentences using the suggestions above (post your new version).

I’ll give quick corrections and, if you make edits, I will include the full revised essay text after you submit the new thesis and paragraph. Would you like to try the thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:21:35.359Z

**You:** Automation is transforming the work methods across industries, and it has both good and bad impacts on jobs. More importantly, these impacts are becoming more noticeable every day. In my opinion, the development of automation actually created more new jobs than before.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:39:08.324Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for pasting your thesis. Quick confirmation: we’re keeping the automation essay (Option A), focusing on the thesis + paragraph 2 (downside), and I’ll give grammar/word-choice hints for that paragraph. Ready to start.

Feedback on your current thesis
"Automation is transforming the work methods across industries, and it has both good and bad impacts on jobs. More importantly, these impacts are becoming more noticeable every day. In my opinion, the development of automation actually created more new jobs than before."

- Strengths: It shows your position (automation has mixed effects and you believe it creates jobs).
- Issues to fix:
  - It doesn’t directly answer the assignment’s long-term question (does automation ultimately enhance or undermine employment prospects?).
  - “In my opinion” is unnecessary in an academic thesis and weakens authority.
  - Tense/wording problem: “actually created” is past tense and vague.
  - Phrases like “work methods,” “good and bad impacts,” and “more noticeable every day” are informal/imprecise.
  - It doesn’t preview the main reasons you will use to support your claim (so readers don’t know the essay’s structure).

Thesis scaffold (fill the blanks)
Use this to craft a clearer, more academic thesis. Don’t copy it word-for-word — fill the gaps with your ideas:
- Although automation displaces routine jobs in the short term, in the long run it [enhances/undermines] global employment prospects because (1) it displaces low-skilled routine work, (2) it creates new, higher-skilled jobs in technology and services, and (3) the effects depend on workers’ access to retraining and policy support.

Quick language tips to use in your rewrite
- Avoid “In my opinion.” State your position directly and confidently.
- Use nouns like automation/automation technologies, routine tasks, labor market, reskilling.
- Use precise verbs: displaces, creates, increases, requires, depends on.

Your turn
Please try writing a revised thesis (one or two sentences) using the scaffold above. I’ll give quick feedback and then we’ll move to paragraph 2. Would you like to try it now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:39:23.932Z

**You:** Automation is transforming the work methods across industries, these impacts are becoming more noticeable every day. Although automation displaces routine jobs in the short term, in the long run it enhances global employment, the developing of automation is actually creating more new jobs than before.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:44:26.966Z

**Assistant:** Nice work—this is a good place to start. Quick, focused feedback on your current thesis (two short sentences you posted):

- Strengths: You state a clear position (automation has mixed effects and you believe it creates more jobs overall).
- Main problems to fix:
  - Grammar/clarity: the first sentence is a comma splice; the second sentence is long and awkward (“the developing of automation” is incorrect).
  - Answer the question more directly: the prompt asks whether automation ultimately enhances or undermines employment prospects — say that clearly.
  - Preview reasons: the reader should know the 2–3 main reasons you will use to support your claim.
  - Tone: avoid “In my opinion” and use confident academic language.

Use this short scaffold to rewrite (fill the blanks; don’t copy word-for-word):
- Although automation displaces routine work in the short term, in the long run it [enhances/undermines] global employment prospects because (1) it displaces low-skilled routine jobs, (2) it creates new higher-skilled roles in technology and services, and (3) outcomes depend on workers’ access to retraining and policy support.

A few quick word choices to use: automation technologies, routine tasks, displace, create, reskilling, labor market, short term / long term.

**You:** Automation is transforming industries, these technological shift ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term. Although automation displaces routine jobs in the short term, the developing of automation is actually creating more new jobs than before.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:50:44.777Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — you’ve made a clear claim and you’re close. Quick, focused feedback on your latest thesis:

- Strengths: You state a position (automation will have a long-term effect) and you repeat your main claim that automation creates jobs.
- Problems to fix (concise):
  - Grammar: comma splice in the first sentence; subject–verb agreement (“shift ultimately enhance” → “shift ultimately enhances”).
  - Word choice/grammar: “the developing of automation” is incorrect — use “the development of automation” or “automation is developing/advancing.”
  - Purpose: it still doesn’t clearly answer the prompt’s question (“enhance or undermine?”) in confident terms, and it doesn’t preview the main reasons you will use to support the claim.

Use this brief scaffold to rewrite (fill the blanks rather than copying):
- Although automation displaces routine work in the short term, in the long run it [enhances/undermines] global employment prospects because (1) it displaces low‑skilled routine jobs, (2) it creates new higher‑skilled roles and industries, and (3) outcomes depend on workers’ access to retraining and policy support.

If it helps, here is one model thesis (read it and then try your own version):
- Although automation displaces routine jobs in the short term, it ultimately enhances global employment prospects because it creates new higher‑skilled roles, spurs growth in new industries, and — with appropriate retraining and policy support — allows workers to transition into better‑paid work.

**You:** On the upside, automation can also bring new jobs. For example, jobs like fixing machines, writing code, and analyzing data are becoming more. And these new jobs often have higher salaries than those old jobs. Besides, using machine to do some works are faster and cheaper than using labors. Therefore, the development of automation can help those new industries who need more workers grow.

**Assistant:** Thanks — you’re doing great so far. Quick check before we start revising step-by-step.

1) Confirm targets
- Earlier you chose: strengthen the thesis + revise paragraph 2 (downside), with quick grammar/word-choice help. Is that still what you want? (yes / no)

2) Paragraph question
- I see you pasted the “On the upside…” paragraph (paragraph 3). Did you paste that because you want feedback on paragraph 3 instead, or was that accidental? Which paragraph would you like to work on now: paragraph 2 (downside) or paragraph 3 (upside)?

3) Thesis
- Please paste the exact thesis sentence you want to revise (copy‑paste it here). If you’d like, try a new version now using this quick scaffold:
  - Although automation displaces routine work in the short term, in the long run it [enhances/undermines] global employment prospects because (1) it displaces low‑skilled routine jobs, (2) it creates new higher‑skilled roles and industries, and (3) outcomes depend on workers’ access to retraining and policy support.
- Would you like to try writing a revised thesis now? Paste your attempt and I’ll give quick feedback.

If you want immediate quick hints for the paragraph you pasted (paragraph 3), here are a few focused suggestions — try revising using these (don’t copy a full rewrite; adapt in your own words):
- Replace vague phrases:
  - “jobs like fixing machines, writing code, and analyzing data are becoming more” → “roles such as machine maintenance, software development, and data analysis are increasing.”
  - “more” (as a noun) → “an increase” or “more positions.”
- Use correct nouns and forms:
  - “using machine to do some works are faster and cheaper than using labors” → “machines perform some tasks faster and at lower cost than human labor.”
- Tighten logic: add a brief reason why these new jobs pay more (e.g., they require specialized skills) and link to the next idea (how automation can help industries grow).
- End with a clear linking sentence that shows how this paragraph supports your overall thesis (e.g., “As a result, automation can stimulate demand for skilled workers and new industries.”)

Which do you want to do first — revise the thesis, or revise the paragraph you pasted? Would you like to try drafting the revised thesis now?

**You:** All in all, the propose of developing the automation is human welfare. So, automation isn’t making jobs less and lead employment worse. On the contrary, it’s making jobs more and advance.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:56:07.589Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — you’ve given me lots to work with. Before we start revising, let’s confirm our targets and priorities so we stay focused.

1) Choose up to two things you most want to improve today (pick from these or add your own):
- Clarity of the main idea (thesis)
- Strength and development of the argument
- Structure and paragraph flow (topic sentences, unity)
- Grammar and sentence correctness
- Vocabulary and word choice

Which 1–2 do you want us to focus on?

Quick diagnostic summary (short, tied to the rubric):
- Content & Ideas: Clear overall viewpoint (automation brings both loss and creation), but claims are general and need stronger, specific reasons and a clear answer to the long-term question.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Paragraph order is okay, but topic sentences and transitions need tightening so each paragraph clearly supports the thesis.
- Vocabulary: Often imprecise (e.g., “automatic machines,” “labors”); choose academic terms (automation technologies, routine tasks, reskilling).
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Frequent small errors (articles, plurals, verb forms) that reduce clarity.

2) From those diagnosed issues, which do you want to focus on now? (I recommend: strengthen the thesis + revise paragraph 2 — downside. Do you agree?)

3) If yes, confirm which body paragraph to work on:
- Paragraph 2 = downside / job loss
- Paragraph 3 = upside / new jobs
- Paragraph 4 = long-term adjustment

4) Do you want quick grammar/word-choice hints for that paragraph? (yes / no)

When you confirm (answers to 1–4), paste the exact thesis sentence you want to revise (copy‑paste it here). If you’d like, try a new thesis now using this short scaffold — then I’ll give feedback:
- Although automation displaces routine work in the short term, in the long run it [enhances/undermines] global employment prospects because (1) it displaces low‑skilled routine jobs, (2) it creates new higher‑skilled roles and industries, and (3) outcomes depend on workers’ access to retraining and policy support.

**You:** Automation is transforming industries, these technological shift ultimately enhances global employment prospects in the long term. Although automation displaces routine jobs in the short term, it ultimately enhances global employment prospects because it creates new higher‑skilled roles, spurs growth in new industries, and — with appropriate retraining and policy support — allows workers to transition into better‑paid work.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T07:57:48.604Z

**Assistant:** Nice — we’re ready to start. Quick check before we begin:

1) Confirm targets: you want to strengthen the thesis and revise paragraph 2 (the downside), and you want quick grammar/word‑choice hints for that paragraph. Is that still correct? (yes / no)

Brief diagnostic summary tied to those targets
- Strengths: You have a clear overall view: automation causes short‑term displacement but can lead to net gains long term.
- Main things to fix now: the thesis needs to answer the question directly and preview your reasons; paragraph 2 needs a clearer topic sentence that links to the thesis plus cleaner, more precise sentences and grammar.

Step 1 — Thesis revision (brief feedback + scaffold)
You asked me to revise this thesis:
"Automation is transforming industries, these technological shift ultimately enhances global employment prospects in the long term. Although automation displaces routine jobs in the short term, it ultimately enhances global employment prospects because it creates new higher‑skilled roles, spurs growth in new industries, and — with appropriate retraining and policy support — allows workers to transition into better‑paid work."

Focused feedback (short):
- Grammar: the first sentence is a comma splice and has subject/verb problems (“these technological shift” → “this technological shift” or rework).
- Redundancy: the two sentences repeat the same point. Combine and make the claim direct.
- Content: say clearly whether automation enhances or undermines employment prospects and briefly preview 2–3 reasons (so the reader knows the essay’s structure).
- Tone: remove “in my opinion” and use confident academic verbs (displaces, creates, enables).

Use this scaffold to rewrite (fill the blanks rather than copying):
- Although automation displaces routine work in the short term, in the long run it [enhances/undermines] global employment prospects because (1) it displaces low‑skilled routine jobs, (2) it creates new higher‑skilled roles and industries, and (3) outcomes depend on workers’ access to retraining and policy support.

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Please paste 1–2 sentences for your revised thesis. I’ll give quick feedback and we’ll move to paragraph 2.

Next step after your thesis
- After you paste the revised thesis, paste paragraph 2 (the whole paragraph you want to revise). I’ll coach you through tightening the topic sentence and improving the supporting sentences with brief grammar/word‑choice hints. You’ll try the revisions and I’ll critique them.

Short prompt: paste your revised thesis now (one or two sentences). Would you like me to show one brief example model after you try, or only give hints?
