            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing the detailed assessment and chat history! You’ve done strong work revising the thesis, topic sentences, and body paragraph with clearer argument and better grammar and vocabulary. The addition of concrete evidence (Qatar’s kafala, COVID-19 impacts) notably improves your essay’s persuasiveness.

Here are some tailored, actionable next-step suggestions based on the overall feedback and chat interaction:

**1. Align Your Essay to the Course Prompt or Justify Your Topic**  
- The biggest content mismatch flagged is that your essay focuses on migrant workers rather than climate change and individual vs institutional responsibility, which is the course’s prompt.  
- To address this, either:  
  a) Reframe your migrant-worker essay by explicitly linking their exploitation to climate-change policies or impacts (e.g., migrant workers in climate-sensitive industries, or how climate policies affect labor rights), or  
  b) Rewrite to directly address the climate change prompt, focusing on individuals vs governments/corporations.  
- Whichever approach you choose, make your thesis clearly responsive to the prompt and adjust body paragraphs accordingly.

**2. Add Explicit Source Attribution and Citation**  
- You include valuable examples but would strengthen credibility by citing sources explicitly in-text (e.g., “According to Human Rights Watch (2020),…”), and if allowed, create a brief reference list.  
- This signals academic rigor and authority.

**3. Deepen Development with Counterarguments and Enforcement Mechanisms**  
- Explore potential opposing views (e.g., concerns about government overreach or costs of enforcement) and refute them briefly to demonstrate critical thinking.  
- Provide more detail on *how* governments can enforce protections (e.g., establishing regulatory agencies, penalties, monitoring systems).

**4. Make Your Revision Process More Visible in Interaction**  
- Going forward, when using AI help, explicitly accept, modify, or reject suggestions with your reasoning in the chat.  
- Share incremental drafts or sentence revisions here to allow targeted feedback on smaller chunks.  
- This will build your critical-review and independent-editing skills in collaboration.

**5. Continue Iterative Refinement of Paragraph Structure**  
- Keep practicing organizing each paragraph with: a strong topic sentence reflecting a clear claim, followed by logically ordered supporting evidence and explanation, concluding with a link back to the thesis.  
- This clarity aids reader comprehension and persuasive power.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 15/25 - The draft expresses a clear stance (government should protect migrant workers) and lists relevant elements (salary, working hours, insurance), but ideas are underdeveloped, repetitive, and the essay is off-task for the course prompt (it does not address the climate-change question). Evidence and nuance are missing.
- Organization: 15/25 - There is an attempt at paragraphing but weak topic sentences, unclear progression and repetition. Sentences jump among ideas without tight logical sequencing.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Uses some relevant terms (salary, working time, insurance) but many collocations and word choices are awkward (e.g., “long hours work,” “use law to strict”), limiting clarity and register.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Frequent grammatical errors (subject-verb agreement, articles, fragments, word order) that often impede comprehension.
- **Original Essay Total: 59/100**

Evidence from original: “About this problem, I personally think the government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard rights.” (thesis — vague, grammar issues); “Migrant workers is a big and significant part in the labor markets.” (grammatical error and weak phrasing).

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The revised essay presents a clearer, firmer thesis and supplies topical examples (e.g., Qatar’s kafala, COVID-19 dormitory outbreaks). Ideas are relevant to the migrant-worker topic and better developed, but the essay still does not respond to the course prompt about climate change (a content-mismatch remains).
- Organization: 22/25 - Paragraph structure and flow are much improved: clear lead sentence, use of example-driven support, and a concise conclusion. Transitions are clearer and paragraph focus is stronger.
- Vocabulary: 22/25 - Improved register and precision (e.g., “enacting and enforcing stringent labour laws,” “widespread abuse,” “social insurance”). Topic-specific terms and collocations are used more accurately.
- Grammar: 22/25 - Sentence structure, punctuation, and grammar are substantially improved; sentences are more fluent and readable, with fewer distracting errors.
- **Revised Essay Total: 86/100**

Evidence from revised: Thesis — “Migrant workers worldwide frequently face exploitation, including unfair pay and excessive hours, due to inadequate regulations. I firmly believe that governments must address this by enacting and enforcing stringent labour laws.” Topic sentence — “Governments, as primary market regulators, are essential for protecting this vulnerable group.” Use of evidence — “investigations into systems like Qatar’s kafala have revealed widespread abuse...”

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +27 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis refined into a clear, assertive statement with improved language and focus.
  - Topic sentence rewritten to be more specific and grammatically correct, improving paragraph focus.
  - Added concrete evidence/examples (Qatar/kafala, COVID-19 dormitory outbreaks) and stronger linking sentences, improving organization and persuasiveness.
  - Grammar, sentence variety, and vocabulary were upgraded, increasing clarity and academic tone.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The essay remains off-task relative to the course prompt about climate change; reframing or aligning the topic to the assignment would be necessary for submission.
  - Citations and source attribution are hinted at but not fully integrated (no precise references or dates); stronger source attribution would increase credibility.
  - Counterarguments and deeper explanation of enforcement mechanisms (how governments would implement reforms) are limited; more development would strengthen argument depth.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 15**
- **Conversation Quality:** The chat shows a sustained, structured interaction. The assistant led a clear revision plan (goals, three-step process) and provided iterative guidance on thesis, topic sentence, paragraph structure, conclusion templates, and evidence to support arguments. The student asked multiple targeted follow-ups (ending examples, topic sentence clarity, paragraph structure, evidence sources). The exchange demonstrates active use of the tutor’s scaffolding, though the student did not produce many back-and-forth drafts inside the chat log itself (the final revised essay was supplied externally).

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - The chat contains 15 exchanges and covers multi-level tasks: goal negotiation, diagnostic feedback, stepwise revision planning, topic-sentence and paragraph advice, conclusion templates, and evidence sourcing. Example: the assistant laid out the three-step revision process (“Step 1: Revise your thesis statement. Step 2: Choose one body paragraph... Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph...”) and repeatedly checked priorities.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 - The student asked clarifying and targeted questions (e.g., “Do you think my topic sentence is clear enough?”; “Please provide me with some evidence...”), showing some engagement. However, there are limited instances in the chat of the student explicitly evaluating, accepting, or rejecting AI suggestions with evidence-based justification. The interaction is more help-seeking than critical appraisal of AI recommendations.
- **Refining Process**: 3/5 - The assistant provided a clear iterative framework and many concrete suggestions; the student pursued multiple targeted areas (grammar, topic sentences, ending, evidence). However, the chat shows few recorded cycles of the student submitting revisions and the assistant responding with further edits. There is evidence of planned iteration, but fewer completed revision cycles visible in the chat log itself.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 11/15**

Evidence from chat:
- Planning and scaffold: assistant: “Here’s how our session will work: ... Step 1: Revise your thesis statement. Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence. Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph...”
- Student goal-seeking: user: “Please help me improve the grammar and sentence structure in my essay and present the entire revised article.”
- Targeted queries: user: “What about the ending part?... Do you think my topic sentence is clear enough?... Please provide me with some evidence or cases based on my argument.”

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear willingness to use AI guidance and follow a structured revision process (evidence: repeated engagement with assistant’s stepwise plan and targeted follow-up questions).
- Effective revision of thesis and paragraph-level writing: the revised thesis and topic sentence are clearer and more forceful, and the body paragraph includes relevant examples (Qatar, COVID-19).
- Improved grammar and register: the revised essay demonstrates better sentence structure and vocabulary appropriate for an academic audience.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Topic relevance: Align the essay to the course prompt (climate change / individual vs institutional responsibility) or ensure the assignment allows the migrant-workers topic. Recommendation: either reframe examples to connect migrant-worker vulnerabilities to climate-policy impacts (if applicable) or rewrite to directly address the climate prompt.
- Source integration and citation: Add explicit references (author/organization and year) when using reports (e.g., ILO, Human Rights Watch) to increase credibility.
- Deeper development: Add counterargument engagement and more detail on how governments can practically enforce protections (mechanisms, monitoring bodies, penalties).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the original draft and clarified revision goals (“Please help me improve the grammar and sentence structure...”), enabling focused help.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The assistant proposed a clear revision plan and the student followed it; the presence of concrete stepwise goals shows strategic use of AI.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement → Developing - The student asked clarifying questions and requested evidence but did not often explicitly evaluate AI suggestions or document acceptance/rejection reasoning in the chat.
- **Independent Editing**: Developing - The final revised essay indicates the student used the assistant’s input to produce a stronger draft; however, the chat does not show many incremental edits by the student inside the session (limited visible iterative drafts).

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Align content to the assignment prompt before substantive revision. If the assignment requires a climate-change focus, either rewrite the thesis and supporting paragraphs to address individuals vs governments/corporations on climate action or clearly justify why the migrant-workers angle addresses the prompt.
2. When incorporating evidence, include brief source attributions (e.g., “According to the ILO (2019), …” or “Human Rights Watch reported that …”) and, if possible, add one or two parenthetical citations or a reference list.
3. Continue using the AI iteratively but add explicit critical evaluation steps in the chat: when the assistant suggests text, respond with acceptance/modification/rejection plus a short rationale to strengthen critical-review skills and document revision decisions.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student has demonstrably improved the clarity, grammar, and structure of their essay and used AI guidance well to revise a thesis, topic sentence, and at least one body paragraph.
- However, the essay appears off-task relative to the course prompt (climate change). If grading for the assignment, please confirm whether the migrant-workers topic meets the prompt; if not, the student should be asked to refocus or to explain the relevance.
- Encourage the student to include source citations and to make their revision process more explicit in the chat log (showing attempted drafts and specific accept/reject decisions) to demonstrate higher-level human-AI collaboration skills.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Nowadays, migrant workers from all over the world are facing exploitation due to weak regulations and suffering long hours work and unfair pay. About this problem, I personally think the government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard rights.

In modern society, the governments always play the leadership role to solve the social problem. Migrant workers is a big and significant part in the labor markets. If the society wants to run this kind of resource properly and efficiently, it need law to let all the sides obey the rules and run properly in a range. Such as the salary, working time, insurance and so on. These sides are common to other workers and working resources in the market, so the migrant workers also need relevant law to be managed and ensure their rights. The governments have the responsibility to use law to manage and protect the migrant workers.

Under an assumption, if the governments don’t use law to strict and protect the right of migrant workers, it may bring an unexpected problem and danger. The migrant workers face the long-term unfair pay and working time, they may suffer to be homeless, poor and unhealthy. These kind of basic living problem can not be reach, there will cause deaths of people or bad times in the society. The
management of migrant workers and people will becoming
loose and more difficult. So the law is
a really important, essential part of it to become
their rights and protect the harmony of society. And
to ensure it to be well used, the government
because it to proper use.

Revised:
Migrant workers worldwide frequently face exploitation, including unfair pay and excessive hours, due to inadequate regulations. I firmly believe that governments must address this by enacting and enforcing stringent labour laws.

Governments, as primary market regulators, are essential for protecting this vulnerable group. For example, investigations into systems like Qatar’s kafala have revealed widespread abuse, such as wage theft and hazardous conditions during major projects like the World Cup. This demonstrates that without strong legal frameworks and active oversight, exploitation persists. Therefore, authorities must legislate to guarantee fair wages, reasonable hours, and social insurance.

Conversely, inaction leads to severe consequences. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted how poor living conditions in migrant dormitories fueled health crises, exacerbating poverty and social instability. This neglect not only causes human suffering but also undermines economic productivity and community cohesion.

In conclusion, proactive governmental intervention through decisive legislation is crucial to prevent exploitation, ensure dignity, and promote sustainable societal development.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-03T17:14:30.894Z

**You:** Hi

*Time:* 2025-12-03T17:24:07.474Z

**Assistant:** Hi — I’m glad you shared your draft. Before we start revising, let’s set clear targets so our work is focused and useful.

1) Quick goal check (your turn)
- What do you most want to improve today? Choose up to two: clarity, answering the question (relevance), argument strength/thesis, paragraph structure/topic sentences, evidence & development, or grammar & vocabulary.
(Short answer is fine — e.g., “Thesis and grammar.”)

2) My suggested targets (you can accept or change)
Based on your goals and the draft, I recommend we focus on:
- Making the thesis directly answer the assignment prompt (relevance & argument strength).
- Strengthening organization: one clear topic sentence + coherent supporting sentences in one paragraph.

Would you like to use those targets, or pick different ones?

3) Quick diagnostic feedback (brief, rubric-based)
I reviewed your draft against the rubric categories. Strengths and main areas to improve:

- Content & Ideas
  - Strengths: You state a clear preference that the government should act to protect workers; you mention specific issues (salary, hours, insurance).
  - Needs work: The essay’s topic (migrant workers’ rights) does not answer the given prompt about climate change and individual vs. governmental/corporate action. This is a major mismatch. Also the argument is general and needs clearer, stronger claims and reasons.

- Organisation & Logical Progression
  - Strengths: There is an attempt at paragraphing and a central idea.
  - Needs work: Paragraphs are disorganized; sentences jump between ideas. Topic sentences are weak or unclear, and transitions are missing. Logical flow needs tightening.

- Vocabulary
  - Strengths: Some relevant terms (salary, working time, insurance).
  - Needs work: Word choice and collocations are often inaccurate (e.g., “long hours work,” “use law to strict”), and repetition occurs. More precise academic vocabulary will help.

- Grammar & Sentence Structure
  - Strengths: You attempt complex sentences.
  - Needs work: Many grammatical errors (verb forms, articles, word order) and sentence fragments make meaning unclear. Sentence variety is limited.

Overall provisional rubric level (honest but supportive): Content 2 (Basic, partly off-topic), Organisation 2, Vocabulary 2, Grammar 2. We can raise these with focused revision.

4) Choose your revision priority
Which of the diagnosed weaknesses would you like to work on now? (Pick one or two.)
- Option A: Make the thesis answer the climate-change prompt and preview main points.
- Option B: Strengthen one body paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences) for unity and clarity.
- Option C: Focus mainly on grammar and vocabulary in a paragraph.

Tell me which option you choose. Once you confirm, we’ll start Step 1: I’ll ask for your current thesis and we’ll revise it together. Would you like to proceed?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T17:24:22.965Z

**You:** Help

*Time:* 2025-12-03T17:25:08.955Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m ready to help. A few quick decisions first so our work is focused and useful.

1) Quick goal check (your turn, one short answer)
What do you most want to improve today? Pick up to two:
- clarity
- answering the question (relevance)
- argument strength / thesis
- paragraph structure / topic sentences
- evidence & development
- grammar & vocabulary

2) My recommended targets (you can accept or change)
Based on your draft, I suggest we focus on:
- Making the thesis directly answer the climate-change prompt (relevance & argument strength). Important note: your current draft is about migrant workers, which does not answer the assignment question about individual vs government/corporate action on climate change. We need to refocus the essay.
- Strengthening one body paragraph: one clear topic sentence tied to the new thesis, plus coherent supporting sentences.

Do you want these targets, or different ones?

3) Quick diagnostic summary (rubric-based and brief)
- Content & Ideas: Strength — you make a clear position about government responsibility (in your draft). Big problem — topic is off-task: the assignment asks about climate change and the role of individual vs institutional action, but your essay discusses migrant workers. This must be fixed.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Attempt at structure but topic sentences and flow are weak.
- Vocabulary: Some relevant terms but many collocation and word-choice errors.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Frequent errors and awkward sentences that obscure meaning.

Provisional levels: Content 2 (off-topic), Organisation 2, Vocabulary 2, Grammar 2. We can improve these by refocusing and revising.

4) Choose your revision priority (your turn)
Which of the diagnosed weaknesses should we work on now? Pick one:
A — Rewrite the thesis so it answers the climate-change prompt and previews main points.
B — Strengthen one body paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences) for unity and clarity (I’ll ask you to pick a paragraph).
C — Focus on grammar & vocabulary in one paragraph.
(You can pick A and B together if you want.)

Please tell me:
- Your choice (A, B, or C or A+B)
- If you accept my recommended targets
- Then we’ll start Step 1. If you choose A (or A+B), I’ll ask you to share your current thesis — note: your draft’s thesis is about migrant workers, so if you want to answer the prompt you’ll need to rewrite it to address climate change. Would you like to try writing a thesis now, or would you like help drafting one after I give feedback?

Ready when you are.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T17:25:24.309Z

**You:** Please help me improve the grammar and sentence structure in my essay and present the entire revised article. Only the draft part is needed.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T17:28:41.423Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is helpful. Before I edit anything, let’s confirm what we’ll work on so our time is focused and useful.

1) Quick goal check (one short answer from you)
You asked for grammar and sentence-structure help. Do you want:
- only grammar & sentence structure (keep the current migrant-workers topic), or
- grammar + refocus the essay so it answers the assignment about climate change (this requires rewriting the thesis and some content)?

2) My recommended targets (you can accept or change)
- If you want to keep the current topic: focus on grammar & sentence structure in one paragraph (C), plus improve one topic sentence to help coherence.
- If you want to meet the assignment: we should rewrite the thesis to answer the climate-change prompt (A) and then revise one body paragraph (B) for grammar and clarity. I strongly recommend this if you plan to submit the essay for the assignment.

3) Choose your revision priority (pick one)
A — Rewrite the thesis so it answers the climate-change prompt and previews main points.
B — Strengthen one body paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences) for unity and clarity.
C — Focus mainly on grammar & vocabulary in one paragraph (keep the migrant-workers topic).

Tell me your choice (A, B, or C), and whether you accept my recommended targets. Once you confirm, we’ll begin Step 1: I’ll ask for your current thesis (or help you draft a new one if you choose A).

*Time:* 2025-12-03T17:28:56.792Z

**You:** What about the ending part? I didn't have time to finish the ending part when I was taking the exam. Could you give me some good examples?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T17:32:15.071Z

**Assistant:** Nice — thanks for asking. Before I give examples, let’s do the short negotiation and diagnosis so our session is focused.

1) Quick goal check (your turn, one short answer)
What do you most want to improve now? Pick up to two:
- clarity
- answering the question (relevance)
- argument strength / thesis
- paragraph structure / topic sentences
- evidence & development
- grammar & vocabulary

2) My recommended targets (you can accept or change)
Because your draft is about migrant workers but the assignment asks about who should act on climate change (individuals vs governments/corporations), I suggest we focus on:
- Making the thesis answer the assignment (relevance & argument strength).
- Strengthening one body paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences) for unity and clarity.

Would you like to use those targets, or pick different ones?

3) Quick diagnostic feedback (brief, rubric-based)
- Content & Ideas: Strength — you clearly take a position (government should act). Needs work — the essay does not answer the assignment prompt about climate change; content must be refocused to the prompt.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Strength — central idea attempted. Needs work — weak topic sentences and unclear flow.
- Vocabulary: Strength — you use relevant workplace terms. Needs work — many collocations and word choices are inaccurate.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Needs work — verb forms, articles, word order, and fragments make meaning unclear.

Provisional rubric levels: Content 2 (off-task), Organisation 2, Vocabulary 2, Grammar 2.

4) Choose your revision priority (your turn)
Which should we work on now? Pick one:
A — Rewrite the thesis so it answers the climate-change prompt and previews main points.
B — Strengthen one body paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences).
C — Focus on grammar & vocabulary in one paragraph (keeping the migrant-workers topic).

You can pick A, B, C, or A+B. Tell me your choice and whether you accept the recommended targets. Once you confirm, we’ll start Step 1 (I’ll ask for your current thesis if you choose A).

About your question on endings
I can help with the ending, but note: the session scope asks me to revise only the thesis, one topic sentence, and that paragraph’s content. So I won’t write a full concluding paragraph for you. I can, however, give a short checklist and a few sentence starters/templates you can adapt to finish the ending yourself. Would you like those now?

If yes — brief guidance and adaptable sentence starters:
- What to include in a strong conclusion (3 quick moves)
  1. Restate your thesis in different words (no new details).
  2. Summarize the main points you discussed (one brief clause each).
  3. End with a final thought: implication, recommendation, or a call to action.

- Short conclusion sentence starters you can adapt
  - Restating thesis: “In conclusion, governments must take primary responsibility for addressing climate change because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”
  - Summarizing points: “This essay has shown that [brief point 1], [brief point 2], and [brief point 3].”
  - Final thought / call to action: “Therefore, policymakers should [specific recommendation], and individuals should [short complementary action].” 
  - Broader significance: “If governments fail to act, the consequences will be [concise consequence]; decisive legislation can help prevent this outcome.”
  - Balanced closing (if you want nuance): “While individual actions matter, systemic change led by governments and corporations is essential to achieve large-scale progress.”

Would you like to:
- Try writing a conclusion now using these starters (I’ll give feedback), or
- Proceed to Step 1 and begin by revising the thesis (if you chose A or A+B)?

Tell me your revision choice (A, B, C, or A+B) and whether you want the conclusion starters now or to focus on the thesis/paragraph first.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T17:32:41.111Z

**You:** Do you think my topic sentence is clear enough? If not, could you offer some suggestions for improvement?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T17:34:16.203Z

**Assistant:** Good question — thanks for asking. A quick check before I give feedback: what do you want to focus now? Pick up to two:
- clarity
- argument strength / thesis
- paragraph structure / topic sentences
- grammar & vocabulary

Since you asked about a topic sentence, I recommend we focus on paragraph structure/topic sentences (and grammar if you like). Do you agree?

Now, about your topic sentence. I assume you mean this one from your draft:
"In modern society, the governments always play the leadership role to solve the social problem."

Brief diagnosis (what’s working and what needs work)
- Strength: It tries to state the paragraph’s main idea (governments should act).
- Problems:
  - Grammar and phrasing errors (articles, word order, collocations) make it awkward.
  - Too vague and too broad: “always” and “the social problem” are unclear.
  - Weak connection to the paragraph’s focus (migrant workers / specific protections). A strong topic sentence should preview the specific reason or aspect you will develop in that paragraph (e.g., enforcement of labor laws, wage protection, regulation of working hours).
  - Lacks a clear stance phrased confidently (avoid hedging).

How to improve it (short guidance)
- Correct basic grammar/collocations: drop “the” before governments, use “play a leading role” or “take primary responsibility,” and say “social problems” or name the problem (e.g., “protecting migrant workers”).
- Be specific and preview the paragraph’s content: say what governments should do and why it matters (e.g., enforce wage laws, regulate hours, provide insurance).
- Use confident language: “governments must…” or “governments should…”

Quick corrected version to show the grammar fixes (you can adapt this)
- Corrected for grammar only: “In modern society, governments play a leading role in solving social problems.”
(That fixes grammar but is still quite general.)

Frames you can use to rewrite (try one yourself first)
- Cause + claim + preview: “Because X [reason], governments should Y [action], especially Z [specifics].”
- Claim + specifics: “Governments must enforce labor laws to protect migrant workers’ wages, working hours, and access to insurance.”
- Role + example: “As the primary regulators of labor markets, governments should enact and enforce laws that guarantee fair pay and safe working hours for migrant workers.”

**You:** Is the structure of my first sub-paragraph clear? or 
are there any areas that need improvement?

**Assistant:** Thanks — good question. Before I give detailed feedback, quick check:

1) What do you want to focus on now? (Pick up to two)
- clarity
- answering the question (relevance)
- argument strength / thesis
- paragraph structure / topic sentences
- evidence & development
- grammar & vocabulary

(Short answer is fine — e.g., “paragraph structure and grammar.”)

My recommended targets for your first sub-paragraph: paragraph structure/topic sentence and grammar & clarity. Do you accept those?

Brief diagnostic feedback on your first body paragraph (the paragraph beginning “In modern society…”):

- Content & Ideas
  - Strengths: You attempt a clear claim — governments should act to solve social problems and protect migrant workers. You name relevant elements (salary, working time, insurance).
  - Needs work: The paragraph is general and repetitive. Some sentences drift or repeat the same idea without adding explanation or an example.

- Organisation & Logical Progression
  - Strengths: There is a central idea you try to develop.
  - Needs work: The topic sentence is vague and too broad; supporting sentences jump between ideas (roles of government, why laws are needed, examples) without a clear logical order. The paragraph lacks a clear mini-structure (claim → reason/evidence → explanation → link back to thesis).

- Vocabulary
  - Strengths: You use relevant terms (salary, working time, insurance).
  - Needs work: Collocations and word choice are often awkward (e.g., “long hours work,” “use law to strict,” “in a range”). Replace these with more natural academic phrases.

- Grammar & Sentence Structure
  - Strengths: You try complex sentences.
  - Needs work: Errors in articles, verb forms, plurals, word order and some fragments make parts hard to follow (e.g., “Migrant workers is” → “Migrant workers are”).

Concrete, focused suggestions (short and actionable)
- Make a stronger, specific topic sentence that previews the paragraph’s reason. A good formula: claim + brief reason + preview of specifics.
- Reorder the paragraph so one idea follows another: topic sentence → a sentence explaining why → an example or specifics (wages, hours, insurance) → a linking sentence that connects to the essay’s thesis.
- Replace unclear phrases with natural collocations: “enact and enforce labor laws,” “fair wages,” “reasonable working hours,” “access to social insurance.”
- Fix basic grammar items: subject-verb agreement, articles (a/the), and plural forms.

Topic-sentence frames you can adapt (try one yourself first)
- “Governments must enforce labor laws to protect migrant workers’ wages, working hours, and access to insurance.”
- “Because migrant workers are particularly vulnerable, governments should take the lead in enacting and enforcing protections such as fair pay and regulated hours.”
- “As the main regulators of labor markets, governments should create and enforce laws that guarantee fair wages, safe hours, and basic insurance for migrant workers.”

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now? Paste your version and I’ll give targeted feedback. After we agree on the topic sentence, we can work on reorganizing and improving the supporting sentences (but I’ll ask you to attempt revisions first).

*Time:* 2025-12-03T17:43:43.040Z

**You:** Please provide me with some evidence or cases based on my argument.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T17:46:41.149Z

**Assistant:** Good — I can help with evidence. First a quick check so I use the right examples:

1) Do you want evidence for the current migrant-workers topic, or do you want examples to support a refocused essay about governments acting on climate change? (Short answer: “migrant workers” or “climate change”.)

2) Which revision target should I align the evidence to? Pick one:
- evidence & development (best match), or
- argument strength / thesis (so evidence supports reasons in a new thesis).

Tell me those two things and I’ll tailor the examples. If you want migrant-worker evidence, here are clear, usable items and short guidance on how to use each one.

Selected evidence and how to use it
(Use these as sources to paraphrase + explain in your paragraph. I’m giving short descriptions of cases and suggested ways to connect each to your argument — not full rewritten sentences.)

1) Kafala system in Gulf countries (Human Rights Watch / Amnesty)
- What it shows: The sponsorship (“kafala”) system has been linked to passport confiscation, withheld wages, restricted movement, and other abusive practices that make migrant workers vulnerable.
- How to use it: Paraphrase a report finding and explain that weak regulation or permissive sponsorship systems let employers abuse workers, so governments must reform and enforce labor laws.
- Quick integration frame: “Reports by human-rights organizations show that [problem]. This indicates that without legal reform and enforcement, migrant workers remain unprotected.”

2) Qatar / World Cup worker-safety reporting
- What it shows: Investigations around major construction projects (e.g., Qatar’s World Cup) documented unpaid wages, excessive hours, dangerous conditions, and poor accommodation.
- How to use it: Use this high-profile example to show concrete consequences of weak enforcement and to argue that governments need stricter standards and monitoring.
- Integration hint: Cite a report or reputable news investigation and then explain how it supports your claim that government action is necessary.

3) ILO and UN reports (global patterns and recommendations)
- What it shows: International organizations (ILO, UN) show that migrant workers are overrepresented in informal, precarious jobs, often missing social protections and fair pay; they recommend national legal protections and enforcement.
- How to use it: Use a statistic or general finding from an ILO report to give weight and authority to your claim that regulation matters.
- Integration frame: “According to the ILO, [summary finding]. This underlines the need for national laws that guarantee [specific protections].”

4) COVID-19 examples (dormitory outbreaks, access to healthcare)
- What it shows: The pandemic revealed how crowded housing and lack of protections put migrant workers at health risk (e.g., outbreaks in dormitories) and how weak systems worsened outcomes.
- How to use it: Argue that beyond wages and hours, governments must regulate living conditions and healthcare access — another dimension of protection.
- Integration hint: Briefly describe the case and connect it to why comprehensive legal safeguards are needed.

Where to find sources (quick search terms)
- Human Rights Watch + “kafala”
- Amnesty International + “migrant workers Qatar”
- ILO + “migrant workers report” or “labour migration” (year 2018–2021)
- News investigations: The Guardian / BBC / NYTimes + “migrant workers Qatar” or “migrant worker abuses”
- Academic: “International Migration Review” + “labour exploitation” 

How to integrate any piece of evidence (3 short steps)
1. Introduce the source: “According to [source], …”
2. Give the fact briefly (one clause).
3. Explain why it supports your thesis: link fact → harm → need for government laws/enforcement.

Would you like to try inserting one of these pieces of evidence into your chosen paragraph now? Pick which piece you want to use and paste your paragraph (or the sentence where you’ll add the evidence). Try a short edit and I’ll give focused feedback and a suggestion to improve it.
