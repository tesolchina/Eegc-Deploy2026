            ## Contribution Analysis

            It appears that the student has not yet engaged in revising the essay or interacting further with the AI assistant after the initial prompt. To support improvement, you might consider reaching out to the student with encouraging questions or concrete suggestions, such as:

- “Could you try rewriting the thesis statement to clearly identify the two main points you want to discuss in your essay?”
- “Would you like me to suggest a clearer way to express your thesis?”
- “Let’s look at one body paragraph together. Can you identify its main idea and suggest how to make it clearer?”

Encourage the student to respond in the chat to begin an iterative revision process. Highlight the benefits of back-and-forth collaboration with the AI to strengthen ideas, clarify arguments, and improve grammar. This active participation is crucial for making meaningful progress. If necessary, schedule a follow-up session to guide the student through these steps and help develop strategic revision skills.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 – The essay addresses the prompt with a clear viewpoint, considers the roles of individuals and governments, and conveys some thoughtful points. There is room for deeper idea development and a more nuanced exploration of solutions.
- Organization: 20/25 – The structure is mostly logical, with clear introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. Some sentences could flow better, and paragraph unity could be improved.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 – Vocabulary is generally appropriate, with basic topic-specific terms, but wording can be repetitive or simplistic and contains some awkward phrases.
- Grammar: 17/25 – Basic grammar is sound, but there are frequent simple errors (“so nothing happen,” “so is not always working well”) and sentence fragments that affect clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 75/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 – No meaningful improvements are present; the content of the revised essay is identical to the original.
- Organization: 20/25 – No structural changes; organization remains the same as original.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 – Vocabulary usage unchanged.
- Grammar: 17/25 – No grammar revisions evident.
- **Revised Essay Total: 75/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None; revision is identical to original.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Thesis statement could have been revised to clarify two main points and strengthen the position.
  - Topic sentences could be rephrased for more thematic unity.
  - Grammar and coherence could be improved with more careful editing.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 1**
- **Conversation Quality:** Short, introductory interaction from the AI with no student response or interaction. The assistant prompts for thesis location, but student does not engage or provide input.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 1/5 – Only one initial exchange; no evidence of back-and-forth or deeper inquiry.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 – No evidence of student responding to or evaluating any AI suggestions.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 – No revision cycles; no evidence of iterative improvement.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 3/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The initial essay shows basic awareness of the prompt and attempts a reasoned response.
- Introduction and conclusion structure are present.
- Attempted engagement with global citizenship concepts.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- No revision steps completed (thesis statement, topic sentence, or body paragraph).
- Student did not engage in the revision conversation with the AI assistant.
- Opportunities for improving grammar, clarity, and argumentation were missed.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement – Student did not provide any context to the AI or clarify goals.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement – No evidence of planning or breakdown of revision tasks.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement – No attempt to consider AI feedback or evaluate revision suggestions.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement – Essay was not edited or revised independently.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Actively participate in the AI revision process by responding to prompts and attempting suggested revisions.
2. Focus on clarifying and strengthening the thesis statement, topic sentences, and development of body paragraphs to reinforce essay coherence.
3. Review grammar and sentence structure carefully, using AI suggestions to address recurring errors.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student did not complete the required revision steps and did not engage in meaningful conversation with the AI. Please encourage the student to reply to the assistant, attempt revisions, and utilize AI collaboration for improvement in future sessions. A follow-up meeting may be necessary to clarify expectations for engagement and revision.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.
