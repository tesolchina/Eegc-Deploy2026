            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing the assessment report and chat history. It looks like the student engaged with the AI assistant by selecting revision targets but did not complete the requested revisions or clarify the essay topic prompt versus draft mismatch.

To help the student move forward productively, here is a suggested next-step message you could send, aimed at encouraging action, clarifying outstanding points, and scaffolding revision work clearly:

---

Hello! I see from the assessment and our chat that you have a clear position in your essay about protecting immigrant workers’ rights, which is a strong start. However, the essay and revision attempt didn’t yet include the actual rewritten thesis or revised paragraphs we discussed.

To finish your final draft successfully, let’s focus on three simple but important tasks:

1️⃣ **Confirm your essay topic:** Are you working on immigration (your current draft) or automation (the assignment prompt)? This helps make sure your thesis and essay match the question.

2️⃣ **Rewrite your thesis statement:** Please rewrite your thesis as one clear, confident sentence that says your main point and previews 2-3 reasons you will explain in the essay. For example:  
“Because immigrant workers contribute to the economy, enrich cultural diversity, and deserve legal protection, the government should enact laws to safeguard their rights.”

3️⃣ **Choose one body paragraph to improve:** Pick the First, Second, or Third paragraph. Rewrite its topic sentence so it clearly supports your new thesis, then add 2-3 sentences with examples or explanations to develop your main idea more fully.

If you want, you can paste your new thesis and your revised paragraph here, and I can give you focused feedback to help you polish your final draft. Also, I recommend doing a careful copyedit to fix punctuation, spelling, and sentence errors to make your writing easier to understand.

Would you like to start by confirming your topic and sharing a new thesis? I’m here to help you turn your good ideas into a clear, strong essay!

Feel free to adapt that message based on your role and the student’s context. If you want, I can help draft specific revision examples or highlight the key mechanical errors from the draft next. Just let me know!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 16/25 - The essay has a clear overall position (the government should protect immigrant workers), but ideas are underdeveloped and repetitive. Example: “From my point of view. the government should safeguard their rights” states the claim but does not preview or develop specific supporting points with evidence.
- Organization: 15/25 - The writer attempts a three-point structure (“First, Second, Third”) which shows planning, but topic sentences and logical progression are weak and paragraphs do not develop coherent chains of reasoning. Transitions are minimal.
- Vocabulary: 14/25 - Vocabulary is basic and often inaccurate (e.g., “creat more weath,” “atsproves the strong strengh,” “unarioadable”), which reduces clarity.
- Grammar: 12/25 - Frequent spelling, punctuation, and sentence-structure errors impede readability (examples: “In nowadays. with the more and more efficient transportation.”; “they make every endeavor to immigrate to these countries to make living.”).
- **Original Essay Total: 57/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 16/25 - No substantive change from the original draft. The same central claim remains, still lacking development and supporting evidence.
- Organization: 15/25 - The revised file is identical to the original; paragraph ordering and topic sentences are unchanged and still weakly linked to a central thesis.
- Vocabulary: 14/25 - No improvement in word choice or correction of inaccurate/misspelled words; same errors persist.
- Grammar: 12/25 - Grammar and punctuation errors remain unchanged in the revised version.
- **Revised Essay Total: 57/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None detected in the revised file; the revised essay is identical to the original.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Revise the thesis into a single clear sentence that previews 2–3 supporting points (economy, legal protection, social integration).
  - Strengthen and clarify topic sentences so each paragraph clearly supports the thesis.
  - Provide concrete examples or brief evidence for claims (statistics, hypothetical scenarios, or logical explanation of cause/effect).
  - Copyediting: correct spelling, punctuation, sentence boundaries, and word choice to improve readability.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9**
  - (Assistant messages: 5; Student messages: 4)
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided a clear, structured revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph edit) and diagnostic feedback. The student engaged by choosing revision priorities (B and D) but did not follow through with actual revisions or the requested clarifications (e.g., which paragraph to revise, alignment with the assignment prompt). Final user message “submit the final draft” indicates intent to finish but no revised text was provided.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Developing. Evidence: multiple, substantive assistant messages with a clear multi-step plan and diagnostic feedback; the chat shows some back-and-forth but is short of the extensive exchanges (15+) that indicate deep iterative work. The student engaged but only up to selecting targets and then did not provide actual revisions.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 - Developing. Evidence: The student accepted the assistant’s structured approach and chose targets (B and D). However, there is little evidence of critical evaluation (no example of the student accepting or rejecting specific rewrite suggestions, nor of justifying choices beyond selecting targets).
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - Basic. Evidence: The assistant repeatedly requested the student to paste a thesis and choose a paragraph; the student selected targets but did not paste a revised thesis or a rewritten topic sentence or paragraph. There is no evidence of multiple revision cycles or iterative refinement.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 8/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student expresses a clear high-level position: “the government should safeguard their rights.” (chat and essay evidence)
- The student engaged with the AI coach, selected revision targets (B and D), and responded to prompts, which shows willingness to work collaboratively.
- The assistant provided a clear, scaffolded revision plan and diagnostic feedback that the student could follow.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Follow-through: The student did not complete the requested revisions (thesis rewrite, topic-sentence revision, paragraph edit) after selecting targets.
- Thesis clarity and preview: Convert “From my point of view. the government should safeguard their rights” into a concise thesis that previews supporting points.
- Development and evidence: Add specific explanations or examples to show how immigrant protection benefits the country and why laws are needed.
- Grammar/mechanics: Fix frequent spelling, punctuation, and sentence-boundary errors to improve readability.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The assignment prompt (automation vs employment) and the draft topic (immigration) were not reconciled by the student. The assistant asked for clarification (“Which topic do you want to work on — immigration or automation?”) but the student did not confirm.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student selected specific revision targets (B, D), showing some strategic focus.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student did not evidence critique of AI suggestions or explain preferences beyond picking targets.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The final revised essay was identical to the original; the student did not perform or submit the requested edits.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise the thesis into one clear sentence that answers the question and previews 2–3 supporting reasons. Example structure to try: “Because X, Y, and Z, the government should enact laws to protect immigrant workers’ rights.” (Then replace X, Y, Z with concrete reasons.)
2. Choose one body paragraph (First/Second/Third). Rewrite its topic sentence so it directly supports the new thesis, then add 2–3 sentences of development (explanation, brief example, or consequence).
3. Run a focused copyedit pass for grammar and spelling (or ask the AI to highlight and explain the top 10 mechanical errors). Fix sentence boundaries and capitalization first to ensure readability.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student engaged at the planning stage and selected revision priorities, but did not complete the actual revisions. The “revised” file provided is identical to the original draft; no evidence of completed thesis/topic-sentence/paragraph edits can be found.
- Instructor may wish to prompt the student to (a) confirm which prompt/topic they are addressing (immigration vs automation), and (b) resubmit a new draft showing: (1) a rewritten thesis, (2) the revised topic sentence, and (3) the revised paragraph. The student would benefit from guided, scaffolded practice converting the assistant’s suggestions into concrete rewritten sentences.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

**You:** However, some immigrant workers fale the exploitation from their enduring long hours to unfair pay. From my point of view. the government should safeguard their rights

*Time:* 2025-11-27T06:18:49.159Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I’m glad you shared this draft. Before we start revising, let’s agree the goals and priorities so our session stays focused and useful.

1) Quick negotiation of targets
- Tell me what you most want to improve in this essay today. Options you might choose:
  - Clarity and strength of the thesis/argument
  - Organization and logical flow (topic sentences, paragraph structure)
  - Development and evidence (examples, reasons)
  - Sentence-level language (grammar, spelling, punctuation)
  - Style and word choice (formal academic tone)
- Which one or two of these do you want to focus on in this session?

2) Short diagnostic feedback (using the rubric categories)
I’ve read your draft. Below is a brief diagnosis of strengths and what needs the most work.

- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: You have a clear stance somewhere in the text — you want the government to protect immigrant workers’ rights.
  - Needs work: The thesis is weak and buried; it does not clearly answer the essay prompt or preview the main points you will use to support your view.

- Organization
  - Strengths: You attempt a clear structure with “First, Second, Third,” which is a good sign that you’re planning supporting points.
  - Needs work: Topic sentences and transitions are unclear or missing; the body paragraphs are not clearly connected to a single, strong thesis.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: You have some ideas about why immigrants matter to a country (economy, culture).
  - Needs work: Points are general and lack specific examples, explanations, or development. Sentences that explain how these ideas support your thesis are often missing or unclear.

- Language Use (grammar, mechanics, vocabulary)
  - Strengths: You can express relevant content and academic ideas.
  - Needs work: Frequent spelling, punctuation, and sentence-structure errors make the meaning hard to follow. Word choice is sometimes inaccurate, and there’s inconsistent capitalization and spacing.

Overall short diagnosis: The main idea (government should protect immigrant workers) is present, but the thesis needs to be clearer and preview your supporting points; one body paragraph should be focused and developed with clearer topic sentences and supporting details; and sentence-level errors need attention to make the argument readable.

3) Student priority selection
- Which of the diagnosed issues would you like to work on now? Please pick up to two priorities. For example:
  - (A) Strengthen the thesis to clearly answer the question and preview points
  - (B) Improve organization by revising a topic sentence and connecting it to the thesis
  - (C) Edit one paragraph for clearer sentences and grammar
  - (D) Add/expand evidence in one paragraph

Please tell me which targets you choose. Once you confirm, we’ll proceed to Step 1 (thesis revision).

A note on scope: Today we will only revise (a) the thesis statement, (b) the topic sentence of one body paragraph you choose, and (c) that paragraph’s supporting sentences. I’ll guide and encourage you to try rewrites first; I’ll give feedback and hints but I won’t fully rewrite whole paragraphs for you.

When you confirm your targets, paste your current thesis (or the sentence you think is your thesis) so we can start Step 1. If you’re not sure which sentence is your thesis, paste the sentence you see as your main claim (for example, the line that currently says “From my point of view. the government should safeguard their rights”) and we’ll work from that.

*Time:* 2025-11-27T06:19:07.074Z

**You:** A) Strengthen the thesis to clearly answer the question and preview points
(B) Improve organization by revising a topic sentence and connecting it to the thesis
© Edit one paragraph for clearer sentences and grammar

*Time:* 2025-11-27T06:22:40.523Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for sharing your draft. Let’s agree goals and priorities so our session is focused and useful.

1) Quick negotiation of targets
Tell me which one or two things you most want to improve today (pick up to two):
- Clarity and strength of the thesis/argument
- Organization and logical flow (topic sentences, paragraph structure)
- Development and evidence (examples, explanation)
- Sentence-level language (grammar, spelling, punctuation)
- Style and word choice (formal academic tone)

Which do you want to work on now?

2) Short diagnostic feedback (brief, by rubric)
I read your essay. Here’s a quick diagnosis of strengths and what needs work:

- Thesis & Argument
  - Strength: You have a clear position: the government should protect immigrant workers.
  - Needs work: The thesis is weak, unclear, and doesn’t preview the main supporting points.

- Organization
  - Strength: You attempted a clear structure with “First, Second, Third.”
  - Needs work: Topic sentences are unclear and don’t connect well to a central thesis; transitions are weak.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strength: You mention reasons why immigrants matter (economy, culture).
  - Needs work: Reasons are vague and need specific explanation or examples showing how they support your thesis.

- Language Use (grammar, mechanics, vocabulary)
  - Strength: You communicate main ideas.
  - Needs work: Many grammar, spelling, punctuation, and sentence-structure errors make meaning hard to follow.

Overall: Main claim is there, but we should make the thesis clearer and stronger, tighten one body paragraph (topic sentence + support), and clean up sentence-level problems in that paragraph.

3) Student priority selection
Please tell me which diagnosed issues you want to focus on. Examples you can pick from:
- (A) Strengthen the thesis to clearly answer the question and preview points
- (B) Improve organization by revising a topic sentence and connecting it to the thesis
- (C) Edit one paragraph for clearer sentences and grammar
- (D) Add/expand evidence in one paragraph

Which up to two do you choose?

When you confirm, paste your current thesis (or the sentence you see as your main claim). If you’re not sure which sentence is the thesis, paste the sentence you think is closest (for example, the line that begins “From my point of view…”). Once you paste it and confirm the targets, we’ll start Step 1 (thesis revision). Would you like to begin?

*Time:* 2025-11-27T06:22:54.302Z

**You:** B D

*Time:* 2025-11-27T06:25:08.761Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing targets B (revise a topic sentence and link it to the thesis) and D (add/expand evidence in one paragraph). Those are a good pair: a stronger topic sentence will help you place and develop better evidence.

One quick but important question before we begin Step 1:
- I noticed your draft talks about immigrant workers and government protection, but the assignment prompt at the top asks about automation and employment. Which topic do you want to work on in this session — immigration (your draft) or automation (the prompt)? We need to be sure so the thesis answers the right question.

When you confirm the topic, please paste your current thesis statement (or the sentence you consider the main claim). If you’re not sure, you can paste the sentence that begins “From my point of view…” and I’ll work from that.

Step 1 (Thesis revision) — what will happen next
- I’ll give short feedback on clarity and strength.
- Then I’ll ask you to try rewriting the thesis yourself (I’ll guide and give hints).
- Reminder of criteria: the thesis must clearly answer the essay question, preview the main points you’ll use, and use confident, precise language (no hedging).

Would you like to start by confirming which topic (immigration or automation) and pasting your current thesis?

*Time:* 2025-11-27T06:25:18.176Z

**You:** submit the final draft

*Time:* 2025-11-27T06:48:13.000Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a great draft to work with. Before I revise anything, we need to agree targets and confirm what to focus on so the session stays useful and focused.

1) Which one or two things do you most want to improve today? (Pick up to two)
- Clarity and strength of the thesis/argument
- Organization and logical flow (topic sentences, paragraph structure)
- Development and evidence (examples, explanation)
- Sentence-level language (grammar, spelling, punctuation)
- Style and word choice (formal academic tone)

2) Quick diagnosis (short—so you can pick priorities)
- Thesis & Argument
  - Strength: You have a clear position — you want the government to protect immigrant workers.
  - Needs work: The thesis is weak, unclear, and does not preview the main points.

- Organization
  - Strength: You attempt a clear structure with “First, Second, Third.”
  - Needs work: Topic sentences are vague and not clearly linked to a strong thesis.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strength: You list reasons why immigrants are valuable (economy, culture).
  - Needs work: Reasons are general and need clearer explanation or examples showing how they support the thesis.

- Language Use (grammar, mechanics)
  - Strength: You communicate ideas.
  - Needs work: Many spelling, punctuation, and sentence-structure errors make some meaning hard to follow.

Overall: The main claim is present but needs a clearer, stronger thesis; pick one body paragraph to revise (topic sentence + development); then fix sentence-level problems in that paragraph.

3) Two quick clarifying questions before we begin Step 1
- The assignment prompt at the top asks about automation and employment, but your draft discusses immigrant workers. Which topic do you want to work on today — immigration (your draft) or automation (the prompt)? We must be sure so the thesis answers the right question.
- Which body paragraph do you want to revise? (First / Second / Third)

4) Please paste your current thesis (or the sentence you see as your main claim). If you’re not sure, paste the sentence that begins “From my point of view…” — I’ll use that to start Step 1 once you confirm targets and the paragraph choice.

Once you answer those items (your target choices, which topic, which paragraph, and paste the thesis), we’ll begin Step 1: revise the thesis together. Would you like to start now?
