            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your training assessment report and chat history. Here are some focused suggestions based on the information:

1. **Stay on Task with Essay Topic:**  
   Your submitted revision did not include changes to the climate change essay but instead focused on a different essay about migrant workers. To make meaningful progress, concentrate all revision efforts on the assigned climate change essay. This alignment helps ensure your work is relevant to the feedback and improves your essay effectively.

2. **Complete the Three-Step Revision Process:**  
   - **Step 1:** Rewrite your thesis to be clear, concise, and precise—state exactly your stance and preview the two main supporting points (government/citizen influence and personal lifestyle).  
   - **Step 2:** Revise at least one body paragraph’s topic sentence to link clearly and logically to your revised thesis.  
   - **Step 3:** Edit that entire body paragraph for clarity, grammar, evidence, and flow. Use specific examples or data for stronger support.

3. **Enhance Your Content with Specific Examples:**  
   Adding named policies (like “plastic bag bans in Kenya” or “Germany’s renewable energy incentives”), statistics, or brief case studies greatly strengthens your arguments. This depth moves your essay beyond general statements and shows critical engagement.

4. **Focus on Grammar and Vocabulary Improvements:**  
   Work on fixing subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, sentence structure variety, and word choice precision. Replace informal phrases (“normal people,” “do green things”) with more academic vocabulary (“citizens,” “adopt environmentally friendly behaviors”).

5. **Engage Critically with AI Feedback:**  
   When receiving suggestions, reflect on which ones suit your writing goals and why. Articulate your decisions in the chat to demonstrate critical thinking and active collaboration.

6. **Confirm Revision Goals with AI Before Starting:**  
   Before making changes, explicitly state your focus to the AI—e.g., “I want to revise the thesis of the climate change essay.” This keeps the interaction targeted and productive.

Following these steps will strengthen both your essay writing and your ability to collaborate effectively with AI tools. If you want, I’m here to help you begin rewriting the thesis now! Would you like to try that together?

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The essay directly addresses the prompt (individual actions vs. government/corporate action) with a clear stance (“I partly agree”) and two main lines of argument: civic influence on policy and personal green habits. Examples are general rather than detailed, e.g., “if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment,” and lack specific cases or data.
- Organization: 20/25 - The structure is clear (introduction, two body paragraphs, conclusion) with logical sequencing (policy influence → lifestyle choices). Some coherence issues at sentence level weaken flow (e.g., “But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little…”).
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Adequate range and topic-relevant terms (“environmental laws,” “clean energy,” “eco-friendly products”), but precision and collocation are limited, with repetition and informal phrasing (“normal people,” “do green things”).
- Grammar: 15/25 - Frequent errors affect clarity (e.g., “the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action,” “so is not always working well,” “so nothing happen,” “it not really enough”). Sentence structure is mostly simple with agreement/tense issues.
- **Original Essay Total: 73/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The “revised” essay text is identical to the original; no content changes were made.
- Organization: 20/25 - Unchanged from the original; structure remains clear but with minor coherence issues.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Unchanged; adequate but not rich or precise.
- Grammar: 15/25 - Unchanged; the same recurring errors remain.
- **Revised Essay Total: 73/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - No substantive textual changes observed between original and revised versions.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Refine the thesis to be more specific and concise (e.g., remove hedging, preview main points precisely).
  - Strengthen body paragraphs with specific, evidence-based examples (case studies, data, named policies).
  - Edit for grammar and clarity; fix agreement, tense, and sentence structure; increase variety and precision in vocabulary.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9**
- **Conversation Quality: Moderate depth but topic misalignment.** The assistant guided a structured three-step revision process. The student attempted a thesis revision—however, for a different essay (migrant workers), not the climate change essay provided for assessment. The student did not complete topic sentence or body paragraph revisions for either essay in the chat.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - The exchange includes guidance and multiple messages, but depth is limited by switching topics (from climate change to migrant workers) and by not progressing through the full revision cycle.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - The student adopted suggestions (e.g., crafting a new thesis) without explicitly evaluating or justifying acceptance/rejection; minimal evidence of critical decision-making.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - The student drafted a new thesis (for the migrant workers essay) but did not iterate to refine it per feedback, nor proceed to revise topic sentences or a full body paragraph.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Willingness to engage with a structured revision process (acknowledged steps and attempted a thesis rewrite in response to guidance).
- Clear identification of two main arguments in the climate essay (policy influence and lifestyle choices), showing alignment with the prompt.
- Consistent stance maintained across introduction and conclusion (“partly agree”), supporting cohesion at the macro level.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Align task focus: Keep the chat and revisions on the assigned essay topic (climate change) to ensure progress translates into the submitted revision.
- Complete the revision steps: After revising the thesis, revise at least one topic sentence and one full body paragraph to demonstrate applied improvement.
- Increase specificity and evidence: Add concrete examples (e.g., named policies like “plastic-bag bans in [country],” emissions data, corporate sustainability commitments) to strengthen arguments.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The chat shifted to a different essay topic (migrant workers), which hindered targeted feedback for the climate essay revision.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The student did not follow through the planned steps (thesis → topic sentence → body paragraph) for the target essay.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - Limited reflection on which AI suggestions to accept or modify and why.
- **Independent Editing**: Developing - The student drafted a new thesis for another essay but did not revise topic sentences or a body paragraph; grammar and clarity issues persist.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Essay writing skills: Revise the climate essay thesis into one precise sentence that clearly states your stance and previews the two main points (policy influence and lifestyle/consumer impact). Then, rewrite one topic sentence to align with the revised thesis and fully edit one body paragraph for clarity, evidence, and grammar.
2. AI collaboration skills: Before revising, confirm the essay topic and goals with the AI. Use an iterative approach—post your revision, ask for targeted feedback (e.g., “Is my topic sentence clearly linked to the thesis?”), and explain your acceptance or rejection of suggestions.
3. Overall improvement: Build evidence depth by incorporating specific examples (named policies, data, or case studies) and improve sentence accuracy through a focused grammar pass (subject–verb agreement, tense consistency, article use, transitions).

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The submitted “revised” climate essay is identical to the original; no changes were made. In the chat, the student attempted a thesis revision for a different essay (migrant workers), and did not complete topic sentence or body paragraph revisions. Recommend redirecting the student to the climate essay and requiring completion of all three steps: thesis, one topic sentence, and one body paragraph revision, with evidence-based improvements.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪
