### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:

- Organization: 20/25 – The essay is divided into logical paragraphs, each with a clear main point. However, topic sentences and transitions could be stronger.
- Vocabulary: 19/25 – Vocabulary is adequate with some topic-specific terms (e.g., “carbon emissions,” “clean energy”). Errors in phrasing (“so is not always working well,” “so nothing happen”) reduce precision.
- Grammar: 18/25 – Mostly accurate grammar but with several notable errors and awkward structures (“maybe just listen a little,” “so this is problem”). Simple sentences dominate.
- **Original Essay Total: 78/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Great—thanks for providing your draft and details. Let’s begin with Step 1 of our Three-Step Revision Process: **Revise the Thesis Statement**.

---

### Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision

**Your current thesis statement:**
> Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

**Comments:**
- **Clarity:** The thesis is clear about your partial agreement, but it’s a bit long and could be stronger.
- **Strength & focus:** You mention both influencing government and individual actions, which is good! However, the phrasing “I partly agree…” and “I also think…” can be replaced with more confident, direct language.
- **Previewing main points:** The thesis does preview, but you can make it more explicit: what will you discuss first? What are you comparing?

**Suggestions:**
- Consider making the thesis statement one clear, direct sentence.
- Use more assertive language, like “While government and corporate action are essential, individual actions, particularly influencing policy and adopting green habits, also play a crucial role in addressing climate change.”

- Preview your two main ideas: citizens influencing government, and personal green habits.
- Keep it one strong sentence.

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement now?  
Type your new thesis statement below, and I’ll help you review and refine it!

If you’re stuck, try starting with something like:  
"Although large-scale policies from governments and companies are crucial in fighting climate change, individual actions—especially influencing political decisions and choosing greener lifestyles—are also essential."
