            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for your excellent revisions! You’ve shown strong academic vocabulary and a clear understanding of how to articulate complex ideas. To move forward and integrate these sentences into a unified, polished paragraph, here’s a suggested version incorporating flow and conciseness while maintaining your meaning:

---

**Revised Body Paragraph (Personal Lifestyle Choices):**

Although individual lifestyle changes may not be as influential as government policies, they still play an important role in addressing climate change. Although these spontaneous actions lack the mandatory nature and systematic enforcement of government policies, they help address issues that policies might overlook, reinforce public consensus on environmental priorities, and serve as a vital supplement to official measures. For instance, when many consumers exert their influence by purchasing from green companies, businesses respond by adopting more sustainable practices to maximize profits and remain competitive. However, many consumers prioritize convenience over sustainability, which limits the overall impact of consumer-driven environmental change.

---

**How to Use This in Your Essay:**

- Replace your current second body paragraph with the above integrated version.
- Make sure your revised topic sentence leads clearly into these supporting details.
- Notice how transitions (“Although,” “For instance,” “However”) help make the paragraph coherent and easy to follow.
- You may highlight how individual actions complement government policies, reinforcing your thesis.

---

If you would like, I can also help you revise your thesis statement and first body paragraph similarly, or assist in integrating the revised thesis, topic sentence, and paragraphs into a full draft for submission.

Please let me know your preference or if you would like me to guide you step-by-step on completing the full integrated essay revision!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

---

## TRAINING TASK COMPLETION CHECK
**Required tasks:**
1. Revised the thesis statement — **NOT completed**
2. Revised one of the topic sentences — **Partially completed** (Student attempted revisions but did not merge with the body paragraph in full context)
3. Revised one of the body paragraphs — **Started, but NOT completed** (Student supplied revised sentences separately and did not submit a fully revised paragraph for integration into the essay)

> **Status:** *not finished*  
The student has not completed all required steps for the revision module. Revision of the thesis statement was discussed repeatedly, but the student did not finalize or submit a revised, integrated thesis. Topic sentence work was attempted, but revision was not confirmed as part of the revised draft. Body paragraph revision is in progress, with discrete sentences provided, but no unified revised paragraph was submitted.

---

## ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

- **Content and Ideas:** 20/25 – Addresses the question with two main points (individual vs. government/company action), somewhat developed, but lacks conciseness and focus.
- **Organization:** 20/25 – Reasonable paragraph structure, ideas progress logically, but transitions and unity can be improved.
- **Vocabulary:** 18/25 – Adequate range; some basic topic terms used, but expression sometimes informal or imprecise.
- **Grammar:** 17/25 – Mostly accurate; some non-standard sentences and awkward phrasing hinder clarity.
- **Original Essay Total:** **75/100**

### Revised Essay Scores:
*(No evidence of integrated revisions; revised draft appears unchanged from original, based on supplied progress and essays.)*
- **Content and Ideas:** 20/25 – No significant change; discussion of both roles maintained.
- **Organization:** 20/25 – No noticeable improvement in structure.
- **Vocabulary:** 18/25 – No additional variety or precision observed in submitted essay draft.
- **Grammar:** 17/25 – No meaningful grammar revision integrated.
- **Revised Essay Total:** **75/100**

### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Preliminary work on enhanced academic topic sentences and supporting sentences (see chat)
  - Demonstrated awareness of importance of vocabulary and nuanced explanation
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Thesis statement not finalized/revised in essay draft
  - Revised topic sentence not integrated into full paragraph
  - Paragraph revision incomplete; sentences improved but not unified in essay
  - Vocabulary and grammar corrections suggested but not implemented in essay

---

## HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges:** 19 (student/AI turns)
- **Conversation Quality:** The chat documents a step-by-step revision attempt, with the assistant guiding, prompting, and supplying models. The student intermittently engages, supplying partial responses, but progress stalls, and the student does not complete the full revision cycle.

### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation:** 3/5  
  *Justification:* Moderate engagement with AI—student asks and receives feedback on revision techniques, attempts to revise sentences, but conversation is largely linear and lacks multi-level probing or a full collaborative cycle.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions:** 3/5  
  *Justification:* Student accepts and repeats many AI suggestions; some evidence of independent rewording and limited academic refinement, but critical evaluation of suggestions is superficial, and justification for revision choices is minimal.
- **Refining Process:** 2/5  
  *Justification:* Minimal iterative cycles; student revises individual sentences but does not fully apply feedback through complete revision of thesis, topic sentence, and body paragraph as a unit. Process interrupted before completion.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total:** **8/15**

---

## OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Demonstrates initial engagement with AI assistant in breaking down revision steps (Task breakdown and willingness to attempt)
- Attempts to use academic vocabulary and reformulate some sentences with guidance
- Recognizes the necessity of thesis-topic sentence-paragraph unity (shows awareness in chat)

### Areas for Improvement:
- Needs to complete revision cycles with drafting, integration, and review—not only revise discrete elements in isolation
- Should finalize and integrate revised thesis statement and topic sentence into essay draft for maximum effectiveness
- Needs more critical justification for accepting or rejecting suggestions—explain choices or request clarification when unsure

### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision:** Good – Student references essay question and task steps, but provides limited in-depth context for essay argument or evidence.
- **Strategic Planning:** Needs Improvement – Student follows prompted steps but skips essential tasks; demonstrates reluctance to iterate step-by-step, resulting in incomplete revisions.
- **Critical Evaluation:** Developing – Student sometimes reformulates AI suggestions but provides little reasoning or analysis; more in-depth questioning or comparison needed.
- **Independent Editing:** Needs Improvement – Relies heavily on AI prompts, rarely attempts full paragraph synthesis independently.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing Skills:** Complete the full cycle for revision—finalize your thesis, clearly revise topic sentences, and integrate improved supporting sentences for unified paragraphs.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills:** Engage in multi-level dialogue with the AI—ask for clarifications, challenge suggestions, and explain your choices for accepting/rejecting edits.
3. **Overall Improvement:** Prioritize task completion before moving steps; summarize what you have learned at each stage and show evidence through your revised draft.

---

## INSTRUCTOR NOTES

- Student demonstrates initial willingness to engage and some academic vocabulary improvement (see revised sentences).
- However, progression stalls before full revision integration—student should be encouraged to follow through with complete cycles and actively apply feedback to written work.
- Recommend more scaffolding or guided checklists to ensure understanding and completion of each step.
- Monitor for frustration or reluctance in iterative processes; suggest time-bound mini-goals for focus in future sessions.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:57:51.879Z

**You:** partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:59:24.903Z

**Assistant:** Great, let’s begin Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision!

**Your current thesis statement is:**
> I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

**Feedback:**
- *Clarity*: The thesis directly responds to the essay topic and shows your viewpoint. Well done!
- *Strength*: It’s a bit long and covers several ideas. Try to make the main argument more concise and assertive.
- *Focus*: Your thesis introduces both “influencing the government” and “personal green lifestyle choices.” Can you preview these as your main points a little more clearly? 
- *Language*: Consider replacing phrases like “I partly agree” with something more direct, and avoid “I think.” Use confident language.

**Revision Tip:**
Aim for a thesis that:
- Clearly answers the essay question (about individual vs. government/company action),
- Signals the essay structure (main points),
- Has strong, precise, and confident language.

**Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now based on these comments? Let me know your revised version, and I’ll offer more feedback if needed!**

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:59:27.963Z

**You:** Ok but I want to move to step 2

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:06:06.035Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely, I understand that you’re eager to move forward—but improving your thesis statement is essential! Your thesis is the “roadmap” for your essay: everything else will connect back to it. Strengthening it now will make revising your body paragraph much easier. 

Let’s briefly try:  
Could you please share your revised thesis statement using my feedback above?  
Remember:  
- Be concise and confident.  
- Preview your two main points: citizens influencing government, and personal green lifestyle choices.  
- Avoid phrases like “I partly agree” or “I think.”  

Just try a new one-liner! Would you like to give it a go? I’ll help you adjust it and then we’ll move right on to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:06:08.461Z

**You:** I strongly

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:06:34.195Z

**Assistant:** Great, you’re starting your revision! Don’t worry about making it perfect on the first try—just give it a shot.

You began:  
“I strongly…”

Can you finish that thesis statement to sum up your position?  
Here’s a quick guide to help:

- State your viewpoint clearly.
- Briefly introduce your two main supporting ideas.
- Keep it confident and direct.

For example (not a full sentence—just a structure!):  
“I strongly believe that while government action is crucial, individuals play an important role by influencing policies and adopting sustainable habits.”

Would you like to try using your own words to complete your new thesis? Just type your revised version, and I’ll help you fine-tune it!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:06:37.130Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:07:24.553Z

**Assistant:** Good start! I see you’re moving your position into your thesis. Let’s make sure it:

- Answers the essay question (impact of individual vs. government/company action)
- Previews BOTH main supporting ideas (“influencing government” AND “adopting personal green lifestyle choices”)
- Uses confident, precise language

Your current attempt (“The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”) is effective, but only covers one main idea. Let’s try to include your second point—about personal lifestyle choices—so your thesis gives a “map” of the essay.

Here are some guiding questions to help you revise:

- How can you mention both influencing government and adopting green habits in one clear, assertive thesis?
- Can you state that both approaches play a role, but with different levels of impact?

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis to combine those two points?
For example, your thesis could follow a structure like:  
“Individuals help fight climate change most powerfully by influencing government policies, but adopting green personal habits also makes a meaningful contribution.”

Would you like to revise your thesis using this idea? You can use your own words—I’ll help you with feedback!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:07:27.820Z

**You:** On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:09:24.568Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! Thank you for sharing your revised thesis as well as the body paragraph you want to work on.

Let’s go step by step with Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision.

**Current Topic Sentence (of chosen paragraph):**  
> On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.

**Quick Feedback:**
- *Connection to Thesis*: It introduces the idea of personal lifestyle choices, which connects to your revised thesis—good! However, it can be stronger by showing its relationship to the main argument right away. 
- *Clarity and Focus*: Try to clarify that these changes are less impactful than government action but still meaningful (as you say in your thesis).
- *Language*: Use confident, academic language and clearly signal that this paragraph focuses on the second point from your thesis.

**Revision Guiding Questions:**
- Does your topic sentence clearly introduce the main idea of this paragraph?
- How can you signal that personal actions have value, even if they are less powerful than structural change?

**Topic Sentence Structure Example (NOT a full sentence, just structure):**
“Although personal lifestyle changes are less effective than collective government action, they still contribute to the fight against climate change by…”

Would you like to try revising your topic sentence to more clearly connect to your thesis and preview the paragraph’s content?  
Type your new version, and I’ll help you polish it before we move to revising the rest of the paragraph!

Remember:  
- Start with a connecting phrase (“Although…,” “While…,” etc.),  
- Mention the value of personal action,  
- Prepare the reader for supporting details.

Would you like to try now?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:09:29.992Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:10:01.930Z

**Assistant:** Great, thanks for sharing your revised topic sentence:

> The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

Before we move to Step 3 (supporting sentences revision), let's double-check:  
Is this topic sentence for your **second body paragraph** (about personal lifestyle choices)?  
It looks like it repeats your first main point (government influence), which is better suited for your first body paragraph.

For the **second body paragraph** (about individual habits), let's make sure your topic sentence:

- **Connects clearly to your thesis’s second main idea** (personal lifestyle choices),
- **Signals that personal actions matter, even if less powerful than government action.**

**Here’s how you might adjust your topic sentence:**  
(You do NOT need to use this wording! Just a model for structure:)  
“Although individual lifestyle changes may not be as influential as government action, they still play an important role in addressing climate change.”

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now using your own words?**  
Aim to:

- Use a connecting word/phrase (“Although,” “While,” etc.),
- Recognize personal choices as less impactful,  
- Still emphasize their value.

Go ahead and type your revised topic sentence for this paragraph—I’ll help you tweak it so it flows perfectly with your thesis!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:10:11.254Z

**You:** Yes I think it is great

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:11:37.351Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic! Well done—your revised topic sentence now smoothly connects to your thesis and clearly sets up the focus for your paragraph. You’re using academic language and creating a logical flow. Nice work!

Let’s move on to Step 3: **Revising the Rest of the Paragraph.**

**Here’s your current supporting paragraph:**
> Individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

**Guiding Questions to Improve This Paragraph:**
- Do your supporting details directly relate to your revised topic sentence?
- Is your explanation clear and easy for the reader to follow?
- Do you give enough examples or evidence to illustrate your points?
- Are there any sentences you could clarify or combine for smoother flow?
- Are there places you can use more topic-specific vocabulary (e.g., “sustainable practices,” “consumer influence,” “environmental impact”)?

**Suggestions (Not Full Rewrites):**
- Make sure each detail or example ties back to the value of personal lifestyle choices in fighting climate change.
- Consider polishing sentences that seem repetitive or unclear—can you explain “why” these actions matter or “how” they might influence larger change?
- Try to use varied sentence structures and transition words to improve coherence (e.g., “Moreover,” “However,” “Therefore”).

**Would you like to try revising one or two sentences in this paragraph first?**

You can start by:
- Expanding one example to show its impact,
- Clarifying a sentence that seems vague or off-topic,
- Using a transition or topic-related vocabulary.

Just pick a sentence you think could be stronger and type your revision!  
I’ll give you focused, supportive feedback on your attempts until you feel happy with the whole paragraph.

Let me know which sentence you want to revise first, or go ahead and share your next version of the paragraph!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:11:42.807Z

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:12:22.044Z

**Assistant:** Great! Now let's focus on **Step 3: Revising the Supporting Sentences** in your chosen body paragraph (about personal green lifestyle choices).

Here's your revised topic sentence (for reference):  
> Although individual lifestyle changes may not be as influential as government action, they still play an important role in addressing climate change.

**Your supporting sentences are:**
> Individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

Let's improve the clarity, unity, and academic style. Please start by identifying **one sentence** from this paragraph you feel could be clearer or more precise.

To help you choose, here are a few suggestions for sentences to revise:

1. **“These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter.”**  
   - Could you use more specific vocabulary or explain why they “still matter”?

2. **“For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit.”**  
   - Can you clarify how consumer choices influence businesses, maybe using terms like “consumer influence” or “demand for sustainability”?

3. **“But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem.”**  
   - This could be clearer and more formal in style. How could you rephrase it to suit academic writing?

**Choose one sentence to revise, or feel free to suggest improvements to more than one! When you share your version, I’ll give you targeted feedback.**  

Would you like to start by revising sentence 3, or do you have another sentence you want to work on first? Go ahead and type your revised version—I’ll respond with suggestions and encouragement!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:12:27.969Z

**You:** 1:Although these spontaneous civil society actions do not possess the mandatory nature and systematicness of government policies, they can accurately reach the subtle corners overlooked by policy coverage, consolidate social consensus, convey people's livelihood warmth, serve as an important supplement to the implementation of policies and a direct manifestation of social vitality, and thus still have irreplaceable value.2: For instance, when many consumers exert their consumer influence by buying from green companies, they boost market demand for sustainability. To maximize profits, businesses will then adopt more sustainable practices to compete.3:  However, many consumers prioritize convenience over sustainability and lack concern, posing a challenge to consumer-driven sustainable practices.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:16:31.292Z

**Assistant:** Excellent job choosing sentences to revise and giving each a more academic and precise style! Let’s review your new versions together and make sure they clearly support your topic sentence, use coherent academic tone, and maintain unity within the paragraph.

**Your revised sentences:**

1. Although these spontaneous civil society actions do not possess the mandatory nature and systematicness of government policies, they can accurately reach the subtle corners overlooked by policy coverage, consolidate social consensus, convey people's livelihood warmth, serve as an important supplement to the implementation of policies and a direct manifestation of social vitality, and thus still have irreplaceable value.

2. For instance, when many consumers exert their consumer influence by buying from green companies, they boost market demand for sustainability. To maximize profits, businesses will then adopt more sustainable practices to compete.

3. However, many consumers prioritize convenience over sustainability and lack concern, posing a challenge to consumer-driven sustainable practices.

### Feedback & Guidance

#### 1. Sentence 1 (Clarifying, Conciseness, Unity)
- **Strengths:** You expanded your explanation about the *value* of individual actions very well, offering concrete ideas like “reaching corners overlooked by policy,” “serving as a supplement,” and “manifestation of social vitality.”  
- **Suggestions:** The sentence is rich, but also quite long and complex. For academic clarity, you might divide it or choose one or two key reasons and state them more concisely.
    - For unity: Focus on how individual actions *fill gaps* or *strengthen policy implementation*.
    - For coherence: Simplify or break up long phrases, and avoid overly poetic terms (“people’s livelihood warmth”).

**Revision Hint:**  
Try splitting it or focusing on one main impact.  
*Example structure:*  
- “Although personal actions lack the mandatory nature of government policies, they help address issues that policies might overlook, reinforce public consensus on environmental priorities, and serve as an essential supplement to official measures.”

---

#### 2. Sentence 2 (Evidence, Academic Vocabulary)
- **Strengths:** You used precise academic terms like “consumer influence,” “market demand for sustainability,” and connected consumer choices to business adaptation, which is excellent!
- **Suggestions:** Consider combining the two sentences with a transition for smoother flow.

**Revision Hint:**  
Try: “For instance, when many consumers exert their influence by purchasing from green companies, businesses respond by adopting sustainable practices to maximize profits and remain competitive.”

---

#### 3. Sentence 3 (Clarity and Formality)
- **Strengths:** You rephrased for clarity and academic style (“prioritize convenience over sustainability,” “posing a challenge”).
- **Suggestions:** This is clear and formal—well done!  
To connect it even more, mention *how this limits the impact of individual consumer actions*.

**Revision Hint:**  
Try: “However, many consumers prioritize convenience over sustainability, which limits the overall impact of consumer-driven environmental change.”

## Next Steps for Paragraph Unity

**Guiding Questions:**
- Do all your supporting sentences flow logically from your topic sentence (“Although individual lifestyle changes may not be as influential as government action, they still play an important role in addressing climate change”)?
- Is your explanation *focused on the value, mechanism, and challenge* of individual actions, rather than introducing unrelated ideas?
- Do you use transition words (e.g., “For instance,” “However,” “Moreover”) for smooth coherence?

**Encouragement:**  
Your academic style and vocabulary have improved so much! If you want, you can now try putting together your revised sentences (with our notes above) for a unified, coherent paragraph.
