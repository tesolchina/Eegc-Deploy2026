            ## Contribution Analysis

            It appears that you have not yet made any revisions to your essay based on the AI suggestions provided. To proceed effectively, I recommend the following steps:

1. **Revise the Thesis Statement:**  
   Your current thesis statement is:  
   *“I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”*  
   This can be clearer and more direct by explicitly stating the two main points you will discuss (influence on government and personal lifestyle choices) and how they contribute to addressing climate change. For example:  
   *“While governments and big companies play a critical role in combating climate change, individuals also contribute significantly both by influencing government policies and by adopting sustainable lifestyle choices.”*

2. **Revise Topic Sentences:**  
   Make sure the topic sentences of each body paragraph clearly relate to the thesis and guide the reader on the paragraph’s focus. For example:  
   - First body paragraph topic sentence: *“One of the most effective ways individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing government policies.”*  
   - Second body paragraph topic sentence: *“In addition to political influence, individuals can make a difference through their daily lifestyle choices.”*

3. **Revise Body Paragraphs:**  
   Expand your examples with clearer explanations and add transition words to improve flow. For example:  
   - Explain how protests, voting, and public pressure have led to actual policy changes in more detail.  
   - Discuss why personal habits matter, giving clear examples, and perhaps addressing common challenges or misconceptions.

4. **Engage with AI Prompts:**  
   When prompted, provide your thoughts or answers to AI questions so you can receive more tailored guidance.

Taking these steps will help you move from the current draft to a revised version with improved clarity, organization, and support for your ideas. If you would like, I can help you rewrite any part of your essay or guide you through the revision process step-by-step. Just let me know!

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.
