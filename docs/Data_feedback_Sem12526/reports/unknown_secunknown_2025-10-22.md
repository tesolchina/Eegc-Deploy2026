## 1. Student's Original Essay and Question

**Question:**  
*The international community should act immediately to ensure that all countries reduce their consumption of fossil fuels, such as gas and oil. To what extent do you agree or disagree?*

**Student's Essay:**  
> Different Countries Should Have Different Treatments  
> Nowadays, more and more people care about environment and know disadvantages of using fossil fuels, such as gas and oil. Some people propose that the international community should act immediately to ensure that all countries reduce their consumption of fossil fuels. For me, I think that we need to reduce fossil fuels using, but that depends on the country's type.  
>  
> Admittedly, fossil fuels cause various environmental problems. Burning gas releases greenhouse gases like CO₂, which will leads to global warming. Moreover, animals' habitat often be destroyed at the time fossil fuels are collected. The process also produce pollutants, which is harmful to environment and all species, including human…… That's why we need to reduce the use of fossil fuels.  
>  
> However, different countries have different situations. For developed countries, they don't care about it because the amount of fossil fuels they need is low, also, they put some producing process to other developing countries. For developing countries, they need fossil fuels to develop their industry and economic. The most important point is that if developed countries reduced fossil fuels using, they have other choices —— renewables, but if developing countries reduced it, they have nothing. So different countries should have different treatment.  
>  
> In my eyes, developing countries should reduce it less than developed countries, and developed countries should help developing countries teach how to use renewable energy. Then, when every countries have abilities of making renewables and renewables become the major energy, all countries can stop using fossil fuels and solve environmental problems together.

|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Task Response (TR)**         | - You address the prompt by discussing the need to reduce fossil fuel usage and argue for differentiated responsibilities. <br>- Your position is somewhat clear but could be more explicitly stated in the introduction and conclusion. <br>- Arguments are relevant but sometimes general or vague. <br>- The essay does not fully engage with the urgency implied by "immediate action." <br>- More specific examples would strengthen your argument. |
| **Coherence & Cohesion (CC)**  | - The essay has a clear overall structure with an introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. <br>- Some linking words are used (e.g., "however," "moreover"), but transitions between ideas could be smoother. <br>- Paragraph topic sentences are sometimes weak or missing, making some paragraphs feel less focused. <br>- Sentence connections can be improved to avoid choppiness and improve flow.                                        |
| **Lexical Resource (LR)**      | - You use some relevant vocabulary related to the environment and energy (e.g., "renewables," "greenhouse gases"). <br>- There are frequent word choice and collocation errors (e.g., "fossil fuels using" → "use of fossil fuels"). <br>- Some informal or imprecise expressions (e.g., "care about it," "nothing") reduce the academic tone. <br>- Try to diversify vocabulary and use more precise terms (e.g., "economic development").                           |
| **Grammatical Range & Accuracy (GRA)** | - Some attempt at complex sentences is evident, but many grammatical errors affect clarity. <br>- Common issues include subject-verb agreement ("animals' habitat often be destroyed"), verb tense consistency, and article usage ("the environment"). <br>- Sentence fragments and run-ons are present. <br>- Improving sentence structure and accuracy will greatly enhance readability and coherence.                                                                  |

## 3. Band 6.0 Model Answer (Based on Student's Ideas)

In recent years, there has been increasing concern about the environmental damage caused by the use of fossil fuels such as gas and oil. Some people argue that the international community should take immediate action to ensure all countries reduce their consumption of these fuels. I partly agree with this view, but I believe the approach should depend on each country’s level of development.

It is true that burning fossil fuels leads to serious environmental problems. For example, the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide contributes to global warming. In addition, the extraction of fossil fuels can destroy animal habitats and pollute the environment, which harms both wildlife and humans. Therefore, it is important for all countries to reduce their use of fossil fuels to protect the planet.

However, not all countries are in the same situation. Developed countries often have more advanced technology and can afford to invest in renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power. In contrast, developing countries may rely heavily on fossil fuels to support their economic growth and industrialization. If these countries are forced to reduce their fossil fuel use too quickly, it could slow down their development and harm their citizens’ quality of life.

In my opinion, developed countries should take the lead in cutting fossil fuel consumption and help developing countries by sharing technology and resources. Developing countries can then gradually reduce their dependence on fossil fuels as they gain access to cleaner energy alternatives. In this way, the international community can work together to solve environmental problems while still supporting economic progress in less developed regions.

## 6. Overall Assessment and Recommendations

**Overall Band Estimate:** 5.5 – 6.0

Your essay addresses the task and presents a relevant position, but frequent grammar errors and limited vocabulary hold you back from a higher band. The ideas are relevant but need clearer development and stronger cohesion.

### Recommendations for Future Practice:

- **Grammar:** Regularly practice grammar exercises focusing on subject-verb agreement, articles, and sentence structure. Tools like Grammarly or writing apps can help identify errors.

- **Vocabulary:** Build topic-specific vocabulary lists (environment, energy, economy) and practice using them in sentences.

- **Essay Planning:** Spend 5 minutes planning your essay outline, thesis, and main points before writing.

- **Linking Devices:** Learn and practice a wider range of cohesive devices to improve paragraph flow.

- **Practice Writing:** Write more essays on similar topics, apply feedback, and seek further reviews.
