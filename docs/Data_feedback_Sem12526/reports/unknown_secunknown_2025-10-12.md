## 📈 Your Contribution Analysis

Thank you for sharing your training mode assessment report and chat history. Here’s a summary of key points and some tailored advice to help you improve both your essay writing and AI collaboration skills going forward:

---

### Summary of Your Current Progress

- **Essay Writing:**  
  Your original essay shows basic ideas about climate change and some awareness of different perspectives, but the development is often superficial, vocabulary is limited, and grammar errors affect clarity. The revised essay unfortunately is shorter and less developed, missing important arguments and showing no improvement in language or structure.

- **AI Collaboration:**  
  You provided course context and confirmed rubric knowledge, which is good. However, the interaction was brief and did not include critical review of AI suggestions, strategic planning for revision, or iterative editing cycles. This limited the potential for meaningful improvement.

---

### Suggestions for Future Development

#### 1. **Essay Revision Strategy**
- **Expand, don’t shorten:** When revising, aim to develop your ideas more fully rather than cutting content. Add examples, explanations, and connect your points clearly.
- **Focus on one area at a time:** For example, start by improving grammar and sentence structure, then work on vocabulary, then organization.
- **Use topic-specific vocabulary:** Learn and practice words related to climate change (e.g., emissions, sustainability, renewable energy) to make your writing richer.
- **Work on transitions:** Use linking words (however, therefore, moreover) to connect ideas smoothly.

#### 2. **Grammar and Sentence Structure**
- Practice subject-verb agreement and verb tenses carefully.
- Try combining short sentences into more complex ones using conjunctions.
- Learn active and passive voice forms and practice paraphrasing sentences using both.

#### 3. **Active AI Collaboration**
- **Ask specific questions:** For example, “Can you show me how to rewrite this sentence in passive voice?” or “How can I add more examples to this paragraph?”
- **Critically evaluate suggestions:** Discuss which AI feedback you agree with or find confusing, and ask for clarification or alternatives.
- **Plan revisions together:** Set clear goals for each revision step (e.g., “Today I want to fix grammar errors in the introduction”).
- **Iterate:** Revise a paragraph, get feedback, then revise again based on that feedback.

#### 4. **Iterative Process**
- Don’t expect to get a perfect essay in one go. Use multiple rounds of revision.
- Reflect on feedback and your own writing to decide what to improve next.
- Keep track of changes and why you made them.

---

### Practical Next Steps

- Choose one paragraph from your essay and ask the AI to help you rewrite it using active and passive voice.
- Request examples of paraphrasing key sentences.
- Practice correcting grammar errors in a short text.
- Engage in a back-and-forth dialogue with the AI about specific revision choices.
- Set small, achievable revision goals for each session.

### Encouragement

Improving writing and AI collaboration skills takes time and practice. Your willingness to share context and respond is a good start. By actively engaging with the AI, asking questions, and working through multiple revisions, you will see steady progress.

Original Essay:

Climate change, it is very huge problem now. I think individual actions not so important like what government and big companies do. But still, I kinda disagree because people also can do stuff to help. I will explain my thoughts here.

First, governments and companies, they got more power. They can do big things. Like, government make laws for no pollution. They can stop plastic bags or tell factories to not make so much smoke. Companies also can change their ways. They can use less energy or make stuff that don't hurt environment. This is good because it change many people life at once. So powerful, you know.

But individual actions, they matter too, I guess. If many people do little things, it add up. Like, turn off lights at home save energy. Or buy things from green companies. Then companies think, oh, we must be green to sell more. But sometimes it hard to know if this really work. People don't always do it. Also, one person doing something. It not enough.

Another thing. When people change their life, like stop using car and walk, government see this. Politicians want votes, so they make rules people like. So individual action can push government to do more. Maybe start big movement. But I not sure how many people need to do this for it to work. Just thinking.

Some say individual action too small. One person cannot fix climate change. True, but if million people try, maybe it help. Every small thing count. Or not? I don't know sometimes.

Anyway, I think both individual and government and companies must work. Individual action seem small but if many do it, it big. We need all to fix this problem. Climate change very bad, so everyone must try hard. That's my opinion.
