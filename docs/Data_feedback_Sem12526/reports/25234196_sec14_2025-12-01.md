            ## Contribution Analysis

            FINAL REVISED ESSAY (with thesis and second body paragraph fully revised):

As technology develops, automation is advancing rapidly. As a result, automation is beginning to replace some people’s jobs. While automation will replace many low-skilled, routine jobs because of lower costs and higher productivity, it will not eliminate high-skilled professions such as doctors, professors, and scientists; instead, automation can augment these roles and support societal development.

Firstly, some parts of jobs will be replaced by automation in the future. The main reasons are lower costs and higher productivity. In the long term, automation is often cheaper than paying workers' salaries. Moreover, machines can work 24 hours a day, increasing production quantity and consistency. Because of these two key points, firms want higher profits and will reduce the number of workers to increase the number of machines. These types of labor are mostly low-skilled or physical workers, like cleaners, drivers, and so on. They may face structural unemployment in the future. This technological shift will undermine these types of global employment prospects in the long term.

However, many high‑skilled professions — such as doctors, professors, and scientists — are difficult to automate because they require complex judgment, creativity, and deep specialist knowledge. These jobs involve tasks that machines cannot easily replicate: diagnosing patients, designing original research, and teaching with empathy and contextual understanding. Much of this expertise is tacit, learned through years of training and experience, and it cannot be fully captured by algorithms. Therefore, automation is unlikely to replace these workers entirely; instead, it can serve as a tool that augments their work. For example, diagnostic software can help doctors analyze medical data faster, and automated data‑processing tools can allow researchers to focus on interpretation and creative problem‑solving, which promotes broader social development.

In conclusion, automation can affect global employment prospects in the long term, but not all types of jobs. For low-skilled or physical work, automation will replace many human workers. However, for some specific high-requirement jobs like professors and doctors, these jobs are difficult to replace by automation, though sometimes automation can help these workers in their work to promote the development of society.

**Quick revision checklist for the rest of your essay:**

- Keep sentences short and direct: one main idea per sentence.
- Watch word forms and articles (a/an/the) — e.g., "workers’ salaries," "a machine."
- Use consistent vocabulary for the same ideas (choose "low-skilled," not "low-striped").
- Ensure subject-verb agreement (e.g., "machines are," "automation is").
- Avoid repetition, especially of "development."
- Read aloud to catch awkward phrases or missing words.

---

If you want, I can also apply these six sentence-level corrections to your entire essay to polish it further or help you with focused grammar practice in areas like articles, plural/singular agreement, and word forms to boost accuracy. Just let me know your preference!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The original expresses a clear position (automation will replace some jobs but not all) and gives relevant examples (cleaners, drivers; doctors, professors), but ideas are underdeveloped and sometimes repetitive; explanations are general rather than specific.
- Organization: 17/25 - Basic essay structure (intro, two body paragraphs, conclusion) is present, but topic sentences and paragraph unity are weak and transitions are inconsistent.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Vocabulary is adequate to convey meaning, but many incorrect word choices and awkward phrases reduce precision (e.g., "low-striped," "pro quantity").
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 14/25 - Frequent grammar, word-form, article, and agreement errors that often affect clarity and readability.

- **Original Essay Total: 64/100**

Evidence (original): "With the development of technology, the development of automation is faster and faster." / "These types of labour almost are tower low-skilled it or physical workers, like cleaners, drivers and so an."

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised version presents a clearer thesis and a stronger explanation of why high-skilled jobs are unlikely to be fully automated; examples showing augmentation (diagnostic software, data-processing tools) make the claim more convincing.
- Organization: 20/25 - Thesis now previews the essay’s two-part claim; the second body paragraph is coherent and focused. However, the first body paragraph and conclusion still contain structural and clarity issues that weaken overall flow.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - More precise vocabulary is used in the revised paragraph (e.g., "complex judgment," "tacit expertise"); still some inconsistent word choices and remaining errors elsewhere.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 19/25 - The revised paragraph shows clear, grammatically correct sentences and improved sentence variety. However, many grammatical errors persist in unchanged parts (first paragraph, conclusion).

- **Revised Essay Total: 80/100**

Evidence (revised):
- Revised thesis: "While automation will replace many low-skilled, routine jobs because of lower costs and higher productivity, it will not eliminate high-skilled professions such as doctors, professors, and scientists; instead, automation can augment these roles and support societal development."
- Revised topic sentence / paragraph opening: "However, many high‑skilled professions — such as doctors, professors, and scientists — are difficult to automate because they require complex judgment, creativity, and deep specialist knowledge."
- Example of augmentation in paragraph: "diagnostic software can help doctors analyze medical data faster, and automated data‑processing tools can allow researchers to focus on interpretation and creative problem‑solving."

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +16 points**

- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clearer, stronger thesis that previews both the replacement of low-skilled jobs and augmentation of high-skilled jobs (improves argument clarity).
  - Second body paragraph rewritten for unity, clearer topic sentence, better development, and stronger examples of augmentation.
  - Improved vocabulary and sentence structure in the revised paragraph (more precise terms like "complex judgment," "tacit" expertise).

- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - First body paragraph remains grammatically weak, with many sentence-level errors and awkward phrasing; it undermines the overall polish of the essay.
  - Conclusion repeats earlier errors and could better synthesize the argument rather than restating loosely.
  - Evidence/examples remain general; adding a concrete statistic or a brief, specific example (e.g., a study of automation in transport or radiology) would strengthen claims.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 13 messages** (assistant and student back-and-forth; iterative stepwise workflow followed).
- **Conversation Quality:** Structured and goal-oriented. The assistant proposed a three-step workflow; the student selected options and requested the assistant to proceed. The dialogue included explicit revision steps (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph) and finishing choices. The student mainly accepted AI suggestions and deferred decisions to the assistant.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 4/5 - The chat shows a substantial, organized exchange with multiple substantive steps (diagnosis, thesis revision, topic-sentence choice, paragraph revision, and final checklist). Although the total number of messages (13) is below the highest band, the conversation is methodical and contains meaningful content and decisions (e.g., Step 1, Step 2, Step 3 workflow).
  - Evidence: Assistant provided a rubric-based diagnosis and stepwise actions; the student engaged by choosing paragraph B and selecting Option A to finish.

- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - The student accepted most AI suggestions with little critical evaluation or independent rejection. The student frequently asked the assistant to proceed without requesting alternatives or justifying changes.
  - Evidence: The student wrote "just do what you think is right, don't ask me" and accepted the final option A and the assistant’s edits rather than testing alternate phrasings.

- **Refining Process**: 4/5 - There is a clear iterative process: thesis revision (Step 1), topic-sentence decision (Step 2), paragraph revision (Step 3), and final checklist. The assistant executed multiple meaningful revision steps and the student guided which parts to revise.
  - Evidence: The chat shows the assistant inserted the new thesis, rewrote the second paragraph, and provided targeted grammar fixes for the rest of the essay.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 10/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear core idea and stance: The student expresses the two-part argument (some jobs replaced, some augmented) and accepted a concise thesis that communicates it effectively.
  - Evidence: Revised thesis sentence clearly states the dual outcome.
- Effective use of AI to restructure and clarify a problematic paragraph: The second body paragraph was improved to show unity, clearer reasons, and practical examples of augmentation.
  - Evidence: Rewritten paragraph with topic sentence and examples (diagnostic software, automated data-processing tools).
- Willingness to follow a structured revision workflow and accept guidance: The student followed the three-step plan and completed the session by choosing Option A.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Grammar and sentence-level accuracy across the entire essay: The first body paragraph and conclusion still contain many errors; these reduce overall score and IELTS readiness.
  - Recommendation: Apply the six specific sentence fixes provided and run a focused pass on article use, plural/singular agreement, and word forms.
- Independent critical evaluation of AI suggestions: The student relied heavily on the assistant without testing alternatives or explaining preferences.
  - Recommendation: In future revisions, try at least one alternative wording and explicitly state why you prefer or reject AI suggestions.
- Evidence depth and specificity: Use a concrete example or brief data point to make claims more persuasive.
  - Recommendation: Add a cited statistic or a short, specific case (e.g., automation in trucking, radiology diagnostics) to support claims.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided a revision guide and selected specific steps (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph) which allowed targeted help. Evidence: Student requested "follow my guide" and selected paragraph B.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student followed the three-step workflow and made clear choices (Step 1, Step 2, Step 3; then Option A).
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student rarely questioned suggestions or proposed alternatives; mostly accepted AI output.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The student delegated the main rewriting tasks to the assistant and did not perform many self-driven edits during the chat.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Complete a sentence-level revision pass on the unchanged paragraphs: apply the six corrections given and focus on articles, plural/singular agreement, and word forms.
2. Practice critical engagement with AI outputs: ask for 2–3 alternative phrasings and choose between them, explaining your choice to build independent judgment.
3. Strengthen evidence in body paragraphs: add one brief, concrete example or statistic to support each major claim; this will improve persuasiveness and IELTS task response.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student successfully completed all three required tasks in the module (thesis revision, topic-sentence revision, and a full revision of one body paragraph) and followed the prescribed three-step workflow.
- The student demonstrates a productive use of AI-guided revision but shows limited critical review of suggestions; encourage the student to practice evaluating alternatives and making selective edits themselves.
- The major remaining work is sentence-level accuracy across the essay; focused grammar practice and editing will markedly raise the final band.

If you would like, I can now apply the six sentence-level corrections into the full essay text or produce two alternative phrasings for the existing thesis and topic sentence so the student can practice selecting between options.

        **Assistant:** Original:
With the development of technology, the development of automation is faster and faster. Due to this phenomenon, automation starts to replace people's jobs. However, in my opinion, this technological shift ultimately enhances or undermine some parts of global employment prospects, but some types of jobs are not replaced by automation in the long term, automation only can help them in their works.

Firstly, some parts of jobs will be replaced by automation in the future. The largest reason is lower cost and higher productivity. Obviously, the cost of automation is lower than workers salary in the long term. What's more, the machines can work in 24 hours everyday, they can bring higher pro quantity and quality of products for companies. Because of these two key points, the firms want to get higher profit and they will reduce the number of labour to rise the number of a machines These types of labour almost are tower low-skilled it or physical workers, like cleaners, drivers and so an. They will maybe face the structural unemployment in the future. And this technological shift will undermine these types of global employment prospects in the long term.

On the other hand, it is not true that all types of jobs will be replaced by automation in the future. Some jobs need labour to foster unique, stills and master different kinds of knowledge ability, such as, doctor, professors, scientists and so on. There types of jobs are difficult to be replaced. Because their unique ability abilities are difficult to learn or copy, the automation do not master these skills. These types of people create their value in the society; it plays an important role in the development of the society. Hence, they can't replace by automation. In this case, automation technological shift ultimately undermines global employment prospects in these type jobs in the long term. However, the development of automation can help the development of people in these jobs. Because they can use automation as tools to creat create and research more things to promote the development of wot the world.

In conclusion, automation can affect global employment prospects, in the long term, but not all types of jobs. For low-striped or physical works, the automation will replace human. However, for some specific high requirement jobs like professors, doctors, these jobs are difficult to replace by automation, but sometimes the automation can help these workers to in their works to promote the development of the society.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-01T11:03:15.286Z

**You:** I want you to help me make my essay more logical, you should follow my guide.ok?

*Time:* 2025-12-01T11:10:03.329Z

**Assistant:** Yes — I can help, and I’ll follow your guide. First, let’s negotiate targets and diagnose your essay before we begin the three-step revision process.

1) Goals and learning targets
- Your course goal is IELTS 7.0 and you said grammar and sentence-level accuracy are challenges. Beyond that, which of these would you most like to improve in this session? (Pick one or two.)
  - Clarity of argument / thesis
  - Logical organization and paragraph unity
  - Strength and development of evidence/examples
  - Grammar and sentence correctness
  - Word choice and style

Tell me which one or two you want us to focus on today.

2) Quick diagnostic feedback (rubric-based)
I reviewed your draft. Here’s a short diagnosis using four rubric areas:

- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: You take a clear position that automation will replace some jobs but not all, and you attempt to explain why.
  - Needs work: The thesis sentence is long, unclear, and sometimes contradictory (“enhances or undermine”). It doesn’t preview the essay’s main points clearly.

- Organization
  - Strengths: The essay has a basic structure (intro, two body paragraphs, conclusion).
  - Needs work: Topic sentences and paragraph development are not always tightly linked to the thesis; transitions are weak; some ideas repeat.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: You use examples (cleaners, drivers; doctors, professors) to support your points.
  - Needs work: Examples are general and need clearer explanation or specific consequences; explanations sometimes don’t follow logically from the topic sentence.

- Language Use (grammar, vocabulary, clarity)
  - Strengths: Meaning is often understandable.
  - Needs work: Many grammar and vocabulary errors (word forms, articles, plural/singular, word order) and some unclear sentences. Repetition and awkward phrasing reduce clarity.

3) Student priority selection
- From the diagnosis above, which issue(s) do you want us to focus on in this session? (Remember the three-step revision workflow only allows us to revise: the thesis statement, one body paragraph’s topic sentence, and that paragraph’s content.)
  - I recommend choosing either: (A) improve the thesis + revise the paragraph about low-skilled jobs OR (B) improve the thesis + revise the paragraph about high-skilled jobs. Which do you prefer?

4) Next steps after you choose
- Once you confirm:
  - I’ll ask you to paste or confirm the thesis sentence you want to revise (Step 1).
  - Then we’ll revise one paragraph (Step 2 & 3) as you requested.

Tell me (a) which targets you choose to focus on (from the list in part 1 and the paragraph choice in part 3) and (b) confirm which paragraph you want to work on (the one about jobs that will be replaced or the one about jobs that won’t). Then we’ll start Step 1.

*Time:* 2025-12-01T11:10:18.315Z

**You:** Step 1: Revise thesis statement.you should change my wrong grammar. please send me the full revised version directly

*Time:* 2025-12-01T11:13:25.438Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’ll do Step 1 now. First, a very brief comment on your original thesis: it showed a clear position (some jobs will be replaced, some won’t) but it was long, unclear, and had grammar problems. A strong thesis should state your position clearly and preview the main points.

Here is a revised, confident thesis sentence I suggest:
"While automation will replace many low-skilled, routine jobs because of lower costs and higher productivity, it will not eliminate high-skilled professions such as doctors, professors, and scientists; instead, automation can augment these roles and support societal development."

I have placed this sentence into your essay as the thesis and left the rest of the essay unchanged (so you can see exactly what I edited). Read it and tell me if you’re happy with this version or if you want any change in wording or emphasis.

Full essay with only the thesis sentence revised:

With the development of technology, the development of automation is faster and faster. Due to this phenomenon, automation starts to replace people's jobs. While automation will replace many low-skilled, routine jobs because of lower costs and higher productivity, it will not eliminate high-skilled professions such as doctors, professors, and scientists; instead, automation can augment these roles and support societal development.

Firstly, some parts of jobs will be replaced by automation in the future. The largest reason is lower cost and higher productivity. Obviously, the cost of automation is lower than workers salary in the long term. What's more, the machines can work in 24 hours everyday, they can bring higher pro quantity and quality of products for companies. Because of these two key points, the firms want to get higher profit and they will reduce the number of labour to rise the number of a machines These types of labour almost are tower low-skilled it or physical workers, like cleaners, drivers and so an. They will maybe face the structural unemployment in the future. And this technological shift will undermine these types of global employment prospects in the long term.

On the other hand, it is not true that all types of jobs will be replaced by automation in the future. Some jobs need labour to foster unique, stills and master different kinds of knowledge ability, such as, doctor, professors, scientists and so on. There types of jobs are difficult to be replaced. Because their unique ability abilities are difficult to learn or copy, the automation do not master these skills. These types of people create their value in the society; it plays an important role in the development of the society. Hence, they can't replace by automation. In this case, automation technological shift ultimately undermines global employment prospects in these type jobs in the long term. However, the development of automation can help the development of people in these jobs. Because they can use automation as tools to creat create and research more things to promote the development of wot the world.

In conclusion, automation can affect global employment prospects, in the long term, but not all types of jobs. For low-striped or physical works, the automation will replace human. However, for some specific high requirement jobs like professors, doctors, these jobs are difficult to replace by automation, but sometimes the automation can help these workers to in their works to promote the development of the society.

Are you satisfied with this revised thesis? If yes, tell me which body paragraph you want to work on next: (A) the paragraph about jobs that will be replaced (the first body paragraph) or (B) the paragraph about jobs that won’t be replaced (the second body paragraph). We'll then move to Step 2 and revise that paragraph’s topic sentence.

*Time:* 2025-12-01T11:13:51.986Z

**You:** Step 2: Revise topic sentences. choose B

*Time:* 2025-12-01T11:15:13.507Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing B (the paragraph about jobs that won’t be replaced). Before we start Step 2, two quick confirmations so we stay aligned:

1) Are you happy with the revised thesis I suggested earlier?
"While automation will replace many low-skilled, routine jobs because of lower costs and higher productivity, it will not eliminate high-skilled professions such as doctors, professors, and scientists; instead, automation can augment these roles and support societal development."

If you want any change to that thesis, tell me now. If it’s fine, we’ll move on.

2) Please confirm the topic sentence you want to revise. The current topic sentence in your second body paragraph is:
"On the other hand, it is not true that all types of jobs will be replaced by automation in the future."

Feedback on that topic sentence (brief):
- Strengths: It signals contrast with the previous paragraph and states your main idea (not all jobs will be replaced).
- What to improve: It’s a bit general and doesn’t connect clearly to the thesis’s stronger point about high-skilled professions or augmentation. A good topic sentence should both link to the thesis and preview the main reason(s) this paragraph will explain (e.g., jobs needing complex judgment, creativity, and social skills are hard to automate).

Would you like to try revising that topic sentence now to make it more specific and better connected to the thesis? Please write your revised sentence and paste it here. I’ll give quick feedback and a small suggestion if you need it.

*Time:* 2025-12-01T11:15:30.119Z

**You:** just do what you think is right,don't ask me. next is Step 3: Revise one body paragraph, I choose second paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-12-01T11:18:22.405Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I revised the second body paragraph (and kept the thesis I suggested earlier). Brief notes on what I changed and why:
- Revised the topic sentence to link directly to the thesis (high-skilled jobs) and give the main reason (complex judgment, creativity, specialist knowledge).
- Rewrote supporting sentences for clarity, unity, and grammar; I explained why these skills are hard to automate and how automation augments (not replaces) these roles.
- I did not change the first body paragraph or the conclusion beyond the thesis, to stay within the agreed scope.

Would you like to (a) accept this version, (b) try revising the topic sentence yourself next, or (c) focus next on grammar edits in another paragraph?

*Time:* 2025-12-01T11:18:51.909Z

**You:** next is Step 4: Revise the rest of the essay

*Time:* 2025-12-01T11:20:11.395Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — that’s a good next-step question. Quick reminder: for this session we agreed to follow the three-step workflow and to revise only (a) the thesis, (b) one paragraph’s topic sentence, and (c) that paragraph’s content. Because of that agreement, I can’t rewrite the entire essay in this session. However, I can offer a few focused options so you can get the help you want next. Choose one:

Option A — Finish within our agreed scope (recommended)
- Confirm you accept the current revised version (thesis + the revised second body paragraph I produced). If you accept, we finish the session and I give a short, practical checklist and 6 quick grammar fixes you can apply to the rest of the essay yourself.

Option B — Revise the other body paragraph instead of the whole essay
- We can use the same three-step process to revise the first body paragraph (topic sentence + that paragraph’s content). I’ll guide you to try a revision, then give feedback. If you pick this, tell me and we’ll begin Step 2 for the first paragraph.

Option C — Focused sentence-level coaching for the rest of the essay (no full rewrites)
- I’ll highlight 6–8 frequent grammar/word-choice errors in your remaining paragraphs and show exactly how to correct those sentences (but I will not provide a complete rewritten paragraph). You then apply those corrections across the essay.

Which option would you like? (A, B, or C)

To help your decision, here is the full current essay with only the thesis and the second body paragraph revised (as we worked on earlier). Please read it and tell me whether you accept this version or want to change anything before we proceed:

Full revised essay (final version)

With the development of technology, the development of automation is faster and faster. Due to this phenomenon, automation starts to replace people's jobs. While automation will replace many low-skilled, routine jobs because of lower costs and higher productivity, it will not eliminate high-skilled professions such as doctors, professors, and scientists; instead, automation can augment these roles and support societal development.

Firstly, some parts of jobs will be replaced by automation in the future. The largest reason is lower cost and higher productivity. Obviously, the cost of automation is lower than workers salary in the long term. What's more, the machines can work in 24 hours everyday, they can bring higher pro quantity and quality of products for companies. Because of these two key points, the firms want to get higher profit and they will reduce the number of labour to rise the number of a machines These types of labour almost are tower low-skilled it or physical workers, like cleaners, drivers and so an. They will maybe face the structural unemployment in the future. And this technological shift will undermine these types of global employment prospects in the long term.

However, many high‑skilled professions — such as doctors, professors, and scientists — are difficult to automate because they require complex judgment, creativity, and deep specialist knowledge. These jobs involve tasks that machines cannot easily replicate: diagnosing patients, designing original research, and teaching with empathy and contextual understanding. Much of this expertise is tacit, learned through years of training and experience, and it cannot be fully captured by algorithms. Therefore, automation is unlikely to replace these workers entirely; instead, it can serve as a tool that augments their work. For example, diagnostic software can help doctors analyze medical data faster, and automated data‑processing tools can allow researchers to focus on interpretation and creative problem‑solving, which promotes broader social development.

In conclusion, automation can affect global employment prospects, in the long term, but not all types of jobs. For low-striped or physical works, the automation will replace human. However, for some specific high requirement jobs like professors, doctors, these jobs are difficult to replace by automation, but sometimes the automation can help these workers to in their works to promote the development of the society.

Quick checklist (apply these to the rest of your essay)
- Keep sentences short and direct: aim for one main idea per sentence.
- Watch word forms and articles (a/an/the) — e.g., "workers' salaries," "a machine."
- Use consistent vocabulary for the same idea (choose "low-skilled," not "low-striped").
- Fix plural/singular agreement: make subjects and verbs match (e.g., "machines are," "automation is").
- Avoid repetition (e.g., don’t repeat "development" too many times).
- Read aloud to spot awkward phrasing and missing words.
