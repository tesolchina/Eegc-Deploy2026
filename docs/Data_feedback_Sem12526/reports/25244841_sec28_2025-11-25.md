### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - Clear stance (governments should protect migrant workers) with three identifiable reasons (human rights, unemployment, economy), but ideas are only briefly stated and underdeveloped. Example: “First, about human right . Migrant worker also should have basic human right…” lacks explanation and support.
- Organization: 15/25 - Basic “First/Second/Last” structure is present, but topic sentences are fragmentary (“First, about human right.”), paragraphs repeat points, and logical connections are weak.
- Vocabulary: 14/25 - Frequent inaccurate or nonstandard word choices (“tune the false,” “hit the minimise salaries limit,” “lower the citycrime”) hinder clarity.
- Grammar: 10/25 - Numerous errors in subject–verb agreement, articles, plurals, sentence boundaries, and punctuation (“Migrant workers always needs to face exploitation during they working.”).
- **Original Essay Total: 56/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 22/25 - Clear viewpoint with well-developed reasons: human rights, fair labor market, and economic/social benefits. Each paragraph explains the rationale and implications. Example: “Tougher labour laws, combined with regular workplace inspections, would not only prevent such abuse but also demonstrate a genuine commitment to universal human rights.”
- Organization: 23/25 - Strong structure with clear topic sentences (“The primary reason is…”; “Another compelling reason…”; “Finally…”), coherent internal flow (claim → explanation → implications), and effective conclusion synthesizing benefits.
- Vocabulary: 23/25 - Precise, formal, and topic-appropriate terms (“minimum wage,” “workplace inspections,” “equal pay,” “purchasing power,” “unscrupulous employers”). Minor repetition, but overall accurate and varied.
- Grammar: 22/25 - Generally accurate with varied sentence structures. Minor stylistic hedging remains (“In my opinion”) and a few long sentences could be tightened.
- **Revised Essay Total: 90/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +34 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Replaced fragmentary thesis with a clear, confident position and added explanatory context (weak enforcement).
  - Strengthened topic sentences so each paragraph states a specific reason tied to the thesis.
  - Upgraded vocabulary and collocations (“low wages,” “excessively long working hours,” “rigorously enforce stricter regulations,” “level the playing field”).
  - Improved sentence accuracy and coherence; eliminated many grammar errors and fragments.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Thesis still contains hedging (“In my opinion”); remove for academic tone and include an explicit three-part roadmap.
  - Add concise, concrete examples or brief data (e.g., a labor inspection policy, penalty for wage theft) to enhance credibility.
  - Acknowledge and respond to a counterargument (e.g., employer costs) to strengthen persuasiveness.
  - Tighten a few long sentences and avoid generalizations (soften crime linkage with “at higher risk” phrasing).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9**
- **Conversation Quality:**
  - The assistant proposed a structured three-step revision (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph). The student asked about grammar, flow, and vocabulary, prompting targeted diagnostics. However, the student did not engage in iterative drafting within the chat (no shared revised thesis or paragraph during the exchange), and there is little evidence of evaluating or rejecting AI suggestions.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Developing depth: multiple messages with diagnostic detail, but limited multi-level questioning from the student and no extended drafting cycles in-chat.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - Basic: Student requested feedback (grammar, flow, vocabulary) but did not explicitly assess, challenge, or justify acceptance/rejection of suggestions.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - Basic: The assistant outlined a clear iterative process, but the student did not proceed through the steps in the chat (no thesis/topic sentence/paragraph revisions posted). The final revised essay indicates independent editing rather than documented iterative collaboration.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear improvement in organization: Topic sentences and paragraph coherence were significantly strengthened, producing a logical progression (rights → fairness → economy).
- Vocabulary and tone: Marked shift to precise academic language and appropriate policy terminology (“equal pay,” “workplace inspections,” “unscrupulous employers”).
- Independent editing: The revised essay shows the student could apply feedback to produce a much clearer, more accurate draft.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Explicit thesis roadmap: State all three reasons in the thesis and remove hedging to enhance academic clarity.
- Evidence depth: Incorporate brief, concrete examples or data (e.g., inspection regimes, penalties, comparative wage figures) to substantiate claims.
- Counterargument handling: Include a one-sentence acknowledgment (e.g., compliance costs) and a succinct rebuttal (e.g., phased implementation, productivity gains) to improve persuasiveness.
- Collaboration process: Engage in iterative drafting with the AI (share revised sentences/paragraphs), and critically evaluate suggestions to build a documented refinement cycle.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The assistant flagged a possible mismatch with a climate-change prompt, but the student did not clarify; later input focused on migrant workers without confirming the prompt explicitly.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The assistant asked the student to choose targets (thesis, organization, evidence, grammar), but the student did not commit to specific priorities or a stepwise plan during the chat.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student sought feedback but did not compare alternatives or justify choices; no examples of accepting/rejecting advice with reasons.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The final essay demonstrates substantial revision quality, suggesting effective self-led application of feedback.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Essay writing: Craft a declarative thesis that previews your three reasons (rights, fair labor market, economy) and remove hedging. Aim to add one short, concrete policy example or statistic per paragraph.
2. AI collaboration: Use the assistant’s step-by-step workflow—post your revised thesis, then a topic sentence, then a full paragraph—and ask for alternative phrasings. Explain why you accept or reject suggestions to document critical thinking.
3. Overall improvement: Address a counterargument briefly and tighten long sentences for concision. Vary synonyms (“employers/companies/firms,” “regulations/standards/laws”) to keep style engaging.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The revised essay shows strong gains in clarity, organization, vocabulary, and grammar compared to the original. However, the chat history does not document iterative revisions; improvements appear to have been made primarily off-chat. For assessing collaboration skills, encourage the student to conduct and record at least one full revision cycle in dialogue (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) with justification of choices.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Migrant workers always needs to face exploitation during they working.Such as lower salaries , enduring long hours . I think government should enforce stricter law to protect and tune the false .

First, about human right . Migrant worker also should have basic human right , and government should provide enough protect to those migrant workers , such as at least hit the minimise salaries limit , having enough rest time or workload is suitable . Government should be the first one to protect those migrant workers . And it also showing the government are supporting human right.

Second , about the unemployment rate. Nowaday , many native-born teenage are unemployed . It is because many company prefer to choose the migrant workers with lower salaries and long working time .This will make native workers lose many chance to get a job or being employed . To fix this bug, I think government should not only protect their basic right , they should treat as a normal low education background person . Make the employment market become fair . 

Last but not the least , about the economic. When migrant workers life can be more protected, they would have more able to shopping or buy some food .It can earn some economic activities when there migrant workers life getting better . It also can lower the citycrime among those migrant workers because of their life getting better .

Therefore , I think that government should enforce strict law to safe guard their right . It give both native or non native workers a better , a fair and base on  human right working place.


Revised:
Many migrant workers suffer exploitation in the form of unfairly low wages and excessively long working hours, mainly because labour laws are weak or poorly enforced. In my opinion, governments should undoubtedly introduce and rigorously enforce stricter regulations to protect the fundamental rights of these vulnerable individuals.

The primary reason is that every worker, regardless of nationality, deserves basic human rights. Migrant workers should receive at least the national minimum wage, reasonable working hours, safe conditions, and sufficient rest periods. When governments fail to set and police these standards, unscrupulous employers exploit legal loopholes to maximise profits at the expense of human dignity. Tougher labour laws, combined with regular workplace inspections, would not only prevent such abuse but also demonstrate a genuine commitment to universal human rights.

Another compelling reason is the negative impact on local employment. In many countries, companies prefer to hire migrant workers because they are willing to accept lower pay and poorer conditions. This practice deprives native citizens, especially young people and low-skilled workers, of job opportunities and contributes to high youth unemployment. By enforcing equal pay and working conditions for all workers irrespective of origin, governments can level the playing field. Employers would then hire based on merit rather than cost, creating a fairer and more balanced labour market.

Finally, protecting migrant workers brings clear economic and social benefits. When migrants earn decent wages and enjoy job security, their purchasing power increases, enabling them to spend more on housing, food, and services. This stimulates local businesses and boosts tax revenue. Furthermore, workers trapped in poverty and desperation are more likely to engage in petty crime. Improved living standards therefore help reduce crime rates and make cities safer for everyone.

In conclusion, governments must implement and strictly enforce stronger labour laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights. Such measures uphold human dignity, ensure fair competition in employment, and deliver wider economic and social advantages. Ultimately, a workplace that respects everyone—native or migrant—benefits the whole of society.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-25T12:57:18.493Z

**You:** can we broke it down first please give me some feedback of my grammar

*Time:* 2025-11-25T12:58:47.284Z

**Assistant:** Great idea—we can definitely break it down and start with grammar. Before we jump in, let’s quickly set clear goals for today and diagnose the draft so our practice is focused and helpful.

Quick check on the essay prompt
- I notice your draft is about migrant workers and labor laws, but the current topic listed is about climate change and whether individual actions matter compared to governments and corporations. Did you intend to write about migrant workers instead? It’s totally fine if you did—just let me know the correct prompt so we stay on target.

Negotiating targets—what would you like to focus on today?
- Which skills are your top priorities right now? Choose up to two:
  1) Grammar accuracy (e.g., verb forms, articles, sentence structure)
  2) Clarity of thesis and argument
  3) Organization and topic sentences
  4) Academic style and word choice

Since you asked for grammar feedback, here is a clear, focused diagnosis you can choose from.

Diagnostic feedback (based on your draft)
- Thesis & Argument:
  - Your current thesis focuses on migrant workers and government protection. It doesn’t match the climate-change question (if that is the intended topic).
  - The thesis doesn’t preview the main points clearly and uses “I think,” which weakens the stance.

- Organization:
  - You use a basic “first/second/last” structure—good start.
  - Topic sentences are not tightly connected to a clear thesis.
  - Some paragraphs include several ideas that would be clearer if separated or ordered more logically.

- Evidence & Development:
  - Reasons are given, but examples are general. Add specific examples, short explanations, or data to support claims (e.g., how wage protection reduces exploitation; how fair hiring policies affect unemployment).

- Language Use (Grammar and Style): Key patterns to improve
  1) Subject–verb agreement
     - “Migrant workers always needs…” → “Migrant workers always need…”
     - “Government should enforce stricter law” → “Government should enforce stricter laws…”
  2) Pronouns and possessives
     - “during they working” → “when they are working” or “during their work”
  3) Articles and determiners
     - “hit the minimise salaries limit” → “meet the minimum wage”
     - “about the economic” → “about the economy”
  4) Plurals and count/non-count nouns
     - “teenage” → “teenagers”
     - “many chance” → “many chances”
     - “their right” → “their rights”
  5) Word choice/collocations
     - “tune the false” → unclear; perhaps “correct abuses” or “address violations”
     - “workload is suitable” → “workload is reasonable”
     - “lower the citycrime” → “reduce urban crime” or “reduce crime in the city”
     - “more able to shopping” → “more able to shop”
  6) Sentence boundaries (fragments/run-ons)
     - “Such as lower salaries , enduring long hours .” → This is a fragment; combine with the previous sentence: “…when they are working, such as receiving lower salaries and enduring long hours.”
  7) Punctuation and spacing
     - No space before commas; one space after commas/periods.
     - “Second ,” → “Second,”
     - “Nowaday” → “Nowadays”
  8) Formal academic tone
     - Avoid “I think” in the thesis; state your position directly.
     - Replace informal phrases like “fix this bug” with “address this issue.”

Choose your priority areas for grammar practice
Let’s pick the 2–3 grammar areas you most want to fix first. Options:
- A) Subject–verb agreement
- B) Articles and determiners
- C) Sentence structure (fragments/run-ons)
- D) Word choice and collocations
- E) Pronouns and plurals
- F) Punctuation and spacing

Next step
1) Please confirm the correct essay prompt (climate-change question or migrant-worker rights).
2) Tell me your top two priorities from the grammar list above (and whether you also want to work on thesis clarity today).
3) After that, we’ll start Step 1 by revising your thesis statement together. Would you like to paste your current thesis sentence now, or wait until we confirm the prompt and targets?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T12:59:17.349Z

**You:** can u talk more about my flow

*Time:* 2025-11-25T12:59:51.045Z

**Assistant:** Great question—let’s talk about your flow and set clear targets so we can improve it step by step.

Quick prompt check
- We’ll keep working with your current topic: Should governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights? If that’s correct, I’ll tailor everything to this prompt.

Negotiating targets (to improve flow)
- Flow usually improves fastest when we focus on:
  1) Clarity of thesis (so readers know the roadmap)
  2) Organization and topic sentences (so each paragraph connects clearly and logically)
- Would you like to make these our two targets for today? If you prefer a different focus (e.g., sentence structure or transitions), tell me and we’ll adjust.

Diagnostic feedback on flow (Organization rubric)
Strengths
- You already use a three-part structure (human rights, unemployment/fairness, economy). That’s a solid foundation.
- Signposting words like “First,” “Second,” “Last but not least” show your intent to organize.

Areas to improve for smoother flow
- Thesis doesn’t clearly preview your three reasons. Without that roadmap, your “First/Second/Last” feels disconnected.
- Topic sentences are vague or fragmentary (e.g., “First, about human right.”). Each topic sentence should state one reason that directly supports your thesis.
- Paragraph unity: Some sentences wander or repeat the same idea (e.g., “Government should be the first one to protect…” appears twice). Keep each paragraph focused on one clear reason.
- Logical connections: The “unemployment” paragraph suggests treating migrant workers as “normal low education background person,” which is unclear and could contradict protecting their rights. A clearer flow is: enforce equal pay and fair hiring to remove incentives to exploit migrants, which also makes the job market fair for everyone.
- Transitions inside paragraphs: Move from reason to explanation to example to result. Use connectors like “for example,” “as a result,” “this means,” “therefore,” instead of listing points without links.
- Sentence structure: Fragments and run-ons break flow. Combine and sequence ideas logically (e.g., “Such as lower salaries, enduring long hours.” should be integrated into a complete sentence).

A clear flow plan (you can use this to guide revision)
- Thesis roadmap: Governments should enforce stricter labor laws to uphold migrant workers’ basic human rights, ensure fair competition in the labor market, and strengthen the economy.
- Body 1 (Human rights): State the right → explain how laws protect it (minimum wage, rest time, safety) → example → link back to thesis.
- Body 2 (Fair labor market): Explain how equal pay and anti-exploitation enforcement remove unfair advantages → example → link.
- Body 3 (Economy and social stability): Show how fair wages increase spending and reduce crime → example → link.
- Conclusion: Restate the thesis and synthesize the benefits (rights, fairness, stability), not just repeat.

Before we begin Step 1, please confirm:
- Are our two targets today: 1) Thesis clarity and 2) Organization/topic sentences (flow)?
- If yes, let’s start with Step 1.

Step 1 — Thesis statement revision
- Your current thesis: “I think government should enforce stricter law to protect and tune the false.”
- Feedback:
  - Use confident, precise language (no “I think”).
  - Clearly answer the question and preview your three reasons.
- Helpful frame: “Governments should enforce stricter labor laws to [Reason 1], [Reason 2], and [Reason 3].”
- Try drafting your revised thesis now, using your three main points (human rights, fair labor markets, economy). Would you like to write it, and I’ll give quick feedback?

Once you’re happy with the thesis, we’ll go to Step 2:
- Pick one body paragraph (human rights, fairness/unemployment, or economy).
- We’ll strengthen its topic sentence so it clearly connects to your revised thesis.
- Then Step 3: we’ll refine the supporting sentences for unity and coherence using short, guided prompts.

Would you like to confirm the targets and share your revised thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-25T13:00:28.206Z

**You:** also what vocab do u think i can replace

*Time:* 2025-11-25T13:01:01.559Z

**Assistant:** Great question about vocabulary—happy to help. Before we dive into revision, let’s quickly set our goals and confirm the focus so our work is targeted and useful.

Quick prompt check
- Are we working with this prompt: “Should governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights?” If yes, I’ll tailor everything to that.

Negotiating targets—what would you like to focus on today?
- Choose up to two:
  1) Grammar accuracy (verb forms, articles, sentence structure)
  2) Clarity of thesis and argument
  3) Organization and topic sentences (flow)
  4) Academic style and word choice (vocabulary, tone)

Diagnostic feedback (brief and clear)
- Thesis & Argument
  - Clear stance but vague and hedged (“I think”). It doesn’t preview your reasons.
- Organization
  - Good basic structure (“First/Second/Last”), but topic sentences are too vague and don’t link clearly to the thesis.
- Evidence & Development
  - Reasons are present, but examples are general. We can strengthen with short, specific examples or clearer explanations.
- Language Use (Grammar & Style)
  - Common issues: subject–verb agreement, articles, plurals, fragments/run-ons, and word choice/collocations.

Your vocabulary question—suggested swaps and stronger academic phrasing
- “lower salaries” → “low wages” or “below-market wages”
- “enduring long hours” → “excessive overtime” or “long, unsafe hours”
- “stricter law” → “stricter laws” or “tighter labor regulations”
- “protect and tune the false” → “protect workers and address abuses” or “prevent rights violations”
- “human right” → “human rights” (plural)
- “provide enough protect” → “provide adequate protection”
- “hit the minimise salaries limit” → “meet the minimum wage”
- “having enough rest time” → “guarantee rest breaks” or “ensure adequate rest periods”
- “workload is suitable” → “workloads are reasonable” or “working hours are reasonable”
- “Nowaday” → “Nowadays”
- “teenage” → “teenagers”
- “many company prefer to choose” → “many employers prefer to hire”
- “lose many chance to get a job” → “lose job opportunities”
- “fix this bug” → “address this issue” or “resolve this problem”
- “treat as a normal low education background person” → “treat migrant workers equally regardless of education level” or “ensure fair treatment for all workers”
- “about the economic” → “about the economy”
- “more able to shopping” → “more able to shop”
- “lower the citycrime” → “reduce crime in the city” or “reduce urban crime”
- Helpful academic verbs: “safeguard,” “enforce,” “curb exploitation,” “ensure compliance,” “uphold,” “strengthen,” “promote fairness,” “deter violations”
- Useful policy terms: “labor standards,” “inspections,” “penalties,” “wage theft,” “overtime violations,” “workplace safety,” “non-discrimination,” “equal pay”

Please choose your priorities
- Which two do you want to focus on today? For flow, I recommend 2) Thesis clarity and 3) Organization/topic sentences. Since you asked about vocabulary, we can pair 4) Academic style and word choice with one of those. Your choice!

Once you confirm targets, we’ll start the three-step revision.

Step 1 — Thesis statement revision (we’ll do this together)
- Your current thesis: “I think government should enforce stricter law to protect and tune the false.”
- Tips:
  - Remove hedging (“I think”).
  - Answer the prompt and preview your three reasons (human rights, fair labor market, economy).
- Frame to guide you: “Governments should enforce stricter labor laws to [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”
- Would you like to try drafting your revised thesis now, using your own words with some of the vocabulary above? I’ll give quick feedback right after.

Short, guiding prompt
- Please confirm: 1) the migrant-worker prompt is correct, and 2) your two targets for today.
- Then paste your revised thesis sentence. I’ll respond with focused feedback and a couple of vocabulary tweaks, and we’ll move on to the topic sentence of one body paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-25T13:01:28.415Z

**You:** and what you think i can change to improve

*Time:* 2025-11-25T13:02:31.556Z

**Assistant:** Great question—and I’m happy to help you improve it step by step.

Preliminary stage — let’s set clear targets and diagnose quickly

1) Quick prompt check
- Are we working with this question: “Should governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights?” If yes, I’ll tailor everything to that topic.

2) Your goals for today (choose up to two)
What would you most like to improve right now?
- A) Clarity and strength of thesis
- B) Organization and topic sentences (flow)
- C) Evidence and development (specific examples/explanations)
- D) Grammar and academic style (accuracy and word choice)

3) Diagnostic feedback (based on your Current Revised Version)
- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: Clear stance; formal tone.
  - Improve: The thesis only mentions “protect fundamental rights.” It doesn’t preview your other two reasons (fair labor market, economic/social benefits). Also, “In my opinion” hedges your stance—academic writing can be confident without it.
- Organization
  - Strengths: Logical three-part structure (rights; fair competition; economy).
  - Improve: Make each topic sentence a clear claim that directly mirrors the thesis. Add stronger internal transitions (reason → explanation → example → result).
- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: Each paragraph explains a reason.
  - Improve: Add 1–2 short, concrete examples (e.g., minimum wage enforcement, equal-pay laws, an inspection program, or a brief data point). This will make arguments feel more persuasive.
- Language Use (Grammar & Style)
  - Strengths: Much more accurate and formal than the original draft.
  - Improve: Tighten a few sentences for concision, vary vocabulary slightly (e.g., “employers,” “firms,” “businesses”), and avoid overgeneralizations (e.g., “workers trapped in poverty are more likely to…”—you can soften with “at higher risk of”).

Top 3 quick wins you can change to improve
- Revise the thesis to preview all three reasons and remove hedging.
- Make each topic sentence explicitly match one reason from the thesis.
- Add one short, specific example or policy detail in each body paragraph.

Please choose your targets
- Which two would you like to focus on today? I recommend A) Thesis clarity and B) Organization/topic sentences for the biggest improvement in flow. If you prefer Evidence or Grammar, tell me and we’ll adjust.

Main workflow — Step 1: Thesis statement revision

Please paste your current thesis sentence here (from your Current Revised Version, it reads: “In my opinion, governments should undoubtedly introduce and rigorously enforce stricter regulations to protect the fundamental rights of these vulnerable individuals.”). If you want to use that as a starting point, here’s focused feedback:
- Remove “In my opinion.”
- Preview your three main points (human rights, fair competition, economic/social benefits).
- Use confident, precise language.

Helpful frame (use your own words):
“Governments should enforce stricter labor laws to uphold migrant workers’ basic human rights, ensure fair competition in the labor market, and strengthen economic and social stability.”

Your turn:
- Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using that frame? Keep it one sentence if possible. I’ll give quick, targeted feedback and we’ll lock it in before moving on.

Next steps after you share your thesis
- Step 2: Choose one body paragraph (human rights, fair labor market, or economy). We’ll revise that paragraph’s topic sentence so it connects tightly to your new thesis. I’ll guide with short prompts and, if helpful, a model.
- Step 3: We’ll refine the supporting sentences in that paragraph for unity and coherence, using brief questions like “Do we have a clear example here?” and “Does this link back to the topic sentence?”

Would you like to confirm:
- The prompt (migrant worker rights) and
- Your two targets for today?

Then please share your revised thesis sentence, and we’ll get started.

**You:** 25244841

*Time:* 2025-11-25T13:08:00.524Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing both drafts and the prompt. We’ll focus on this question: Should governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights?

Preliminary stage — let’s set targets and diagnose your essay before revising

1) Negotiate targets
What would you most like to improve today? Choose up to two:
- A) Clarity and strength of the thesis
- B) Organization and topic sentences (flow)
- C) Evidence and development (clear examples/explanations)
- D) Grammar and academic style (accuracy and word choice)

2) Diagnostic feedback (based on your Current Revised Version)

Thesis & Argument
- Strengths: Clear position; formal and confident tone.
- Improve:
  - Remove hedging (“In my opinion”) to sound more academic.
  - Preview your three reasons in the thesis (human rights, fair competition in the labor market, and economic/social benefits) so the reader sees the roadmap from the start.

Organization
- Strengths: Solid three-reason structure; clear paragraph focus (rights; fair labor market; economy).
- Improve:
  - Make each topic sentence explicitly echo the thesis (e.g., “To uphold basic human rights, governments must…”).
  - Use a consistent internal pattern in each paragraph: claim → explanation → brief example → result → link back to thesis.
  - Smooth transitions between sentences (e.g., “For example,” “As a result,” “This ensures…”).

Evidence & Development
- Strengths: Reasons are logical and relevant.
- Improve:
  - Add 1–2 short, concrete details per paragraph (e.g., “routine inspections by labor authorities,” “penalties for wage theft,” “equal pay for equal work provisions,” or a brief statistic if you have one).
  - Consider a one-sentence acknowledgment of a counterpoint (e.g., employer costs) and a quick response (e.g., phased implementation, tax credits for compliance) to strengthen persuasiveness.

Language Use (Grammar & Style)
- Strengths: Much clearer, more accurate, and more formal than the original draft.
- Improve:
  - Concision: Trim a few longer sentences for punch.
  - Avoid overgeneralizations (e.g., “are more likely to engage in petty crime” → “are at higher risk of petty crime when wages are exploitative”).
  - Minor variety in word choice (alternate “employers/companies/firms,” “regulations/labor standards,” “protect/safeguard/uphold”).

3) Student priority selection
- Which two areas would you like to focus on today? My recommendation for the biggest impact:
  - A) Thesis clarity and strength
  - B) Organization and topic sentences
- If you prefer to focus on evidence or grammar/style instead, that’s fine—just tell me.

Once you confirm your targets, we’ll start the three-step revision workflow.

Main workflow plan (what we’ll do next, after you choose targets)
- Step 1 — Thesis statement: We’ll refine it to answer the question clearly, preview your three reasons, and use confident language.
- Step 2 — Topic sentence: You’ll pick one body paragraph (human rights, fair labor market, or economy), and we’ll improve its topic sentence so it aligns tightly with the new thesis.
- Step 3 — Supporting sentences: We’ll revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity, unity, and coherence, adding or sharpening one concrete example if needed.

Quick questions to proceed
- Which two targets do you choose (A, B, C, or D)?
- For Step 2 later, which paragraph would you like to work on (human rights, fair labor market, or economy)?
- When you’re ready, please paste your current thesis sentence so we can begin Step 1. If you want, we can start from your present version: “In my opinion, governments should undoubtedly introduce and rigorously enforce stricter regulations to protect the fundamental rights of these vulnerable individuals.”
