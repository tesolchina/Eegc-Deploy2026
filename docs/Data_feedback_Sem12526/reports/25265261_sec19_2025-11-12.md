            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for your patience and engagement so far! To help you move forward, here is a clear, confident, and concise model thesis statement based on your original ideas. You can use it as a guide to rewrite your own:

**Model Thesis Statement:**

"While individual actions alone cannot solve climate change, citizens play a crucial role by influencing government policies, and personal lifestyle choices also contribute to environmental progress."

This thesis:

- Clearly states your position without hesitation.
- Introduces the two main points you will discuss: influencing government and personal choices.
- Sets a clear roadmap for your essay.

Would you like to try revising your thesis statement using this structure? If you want, I can help you step-by-step with wording, or you can draft it and I will provide feedback. Just let me know how you’d like to proceed!

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s get started with Step 1 of our revision process: **Revising your thesis statement.**

**Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**

First, please copy and paste your current thesis statement here, or rewrite it as you think it is now. This is usually the main argument or answer to the essay question, found at the end of your introduction. 

Once you share your thesis, I will offer feedback on:

- Clarity: Is it easy to understand?
- Strength: Does it present a clear argument?
- Focus: Does it tell the reader what your essay will discuss?

Remember, a strong thesis statement should:

- Clearly answer the essay question (in your own words).
- Preview the main points or structure of your essay.
- Use confident, precise language (don't use “I think” or “maybe”).

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement! Here it is again so we can analyze it together:

> Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

**Feedback:**

- **Clarity:** The main argument is there, but the thesis could be clearer and more direct. The sentence is a little long, and the main points get a bit lost.
- **Strength:** Phrases like "I partly agree" and "I also think" could be more confident and precise. Try to state your position directly.
- **Focus:** You hint at two main points: 1) citizens can influence the government, and 2) personal choices have some impact. Great! Try to preview this structure a little more specifically.

**Suggestions for Improving:**
- Make the thesis one clear sentence.
- Remove unsure language like “I partly agree” or “I think.”
- Mention the two main ways individuals can contribute (influencing government and personal habits).
- State your overall position: Individuals do have some impact, but working with governments is most important.

Would you like to try revising your thesis now, or would you like a model of how to make it more concise and confident (I’ll just offer a starting phrase, not a full sentence)?

Let me know if you want to try first!
