**结尾修改版：**

In conclusion, although automation brings significant improvements in efficiency, its long-term impact on global employment is concerning. By replacing many traditional jobs and widening the gap between skilled and unskilled workers, automation threatens to undermine job opportunities worldwide. Therefore, it is essential for governments and businesses to take proactive measures, such as investing in retraining programs and promoting inclusive economic policies, to ensure that technological progress benefits all members of society and does not leave anyone behind.

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 16/25 – The essay attempts to answer the prompt and discusses both sides (short-term and long-term impacts), but ideas are underdeveloped, with some confusion and lack of clear argumentation relevant to the global employment focus.
- Organization: 16/25 – Basic paragraph structure is present, but transitions are weak and the essay moves abruptly between points without logical flow. Paragraphing is inconsistent.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 – There is some variety, but several inaccurate word choices ("semester" instead of "region," "transfermation," "quanlity") and awkward phrasing reduce clarity.
- Grammar: 14/25 – Frequent errors impede understanding: tense errors, run-ons, misplaced punctuation, unclear referents.
- **Original Essay Total: 61/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 23/25 – Arguments are much clearer; the thesis directly answers the prompt, and two key reasons (job replacement and increasing inequality) are explained in detail with relevant industry examples.
- Organization: 23/25 – Paragraphing is much improved; clear introduction, two distinct body paragraphs with strong topic sentences, logical ordering of ideas, smooth transitions.
- Vocabulary: 22/25 – Greater topic-specific variety (automation, inequality, unskilled/skilled workers, assembly line, retraining). Minor errors remain but do not strongly interfere with meaning.
- Grammar: 20/25 – Mostly accurate sentences; significant improvement in sentence structure. Some translation errors and awkwardness persist, but no major impediments.
- **Revised Essay Total: 88/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +27 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Strong, clear thesis statement that directly answers the prompt and previews two focused reasons.
  - Revised first body paragraph with a clear topic sentence and supporting examples explicitly linked to argument.
  - Improved vocabulary and sentence fluency, making academic tone more consistent.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Second body paragraph received less direct revision, with lingering language/clarity issues and need for more explanation and example.
  - Some grammatical errors and awkward phrases persist, especially in the latter half if the essay.
  - The conclusion could still be strengthened with a more academic and integrative summary sentence.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 36**
- **Conversation Quality:** The student engaged in multiple back-and-forth exchanges, responding to guided questions about thesis clarity, topic sentences, and paragraph structure. The student requested rewriting help, confirmed revisions, and actively participated in guided sentence-level revisions. The dialog shows iterative revision, but sometimes responses reverted to repeating prior drafts without full incorporation of feedback; follow-up on the second paragraph and conclusion was started but incomplete.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 4/5 – The conversation included over 30 exchanges. The student engaged at multiple levels, asked for help with both thesis and body paragraph structure, and sought assistance with specific sentence rewrites and examples, including in Chinese. Some responses were brief or repeated, but overall, the depth was robust and demonstrated multi-step revision.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 – The student sometimes critically evaluated language by rewriting sentences based on a template or feedback but also often accepted suggestions with minimum modification. Most feedback was applied, but engagement was somewhat passive at points, with limited justification or critique.
- **Refining Process**: 3/5 – The revision process showed clear iterative refinement for the thesis statement and first body paragraph, with multiple revision cycles and confirmations. However, the second body paragraph and conclusion remained less fully developed, and the process was not extended across the whole essay.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 10/15**

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- **Targeted Revision and Response to Feedback:** The student made significant improvements to thesis clarity and paragraph structure after detailed feedback, especially in the opening argument and first body section.
- **Active Engagement in the Revision Process:** Participated in guided rewriting, requested help with specific sentences and sections, and confirmed AI suggestions for final adoption.
- **Increased Academic Tone and Specificity:** Improved vocabulary and coherence, and better addressed the essay prompt in the revised draft.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- **Consistency in Applying Revision Across the Essay:** The iterative process focused primarily on the thesis and first body paragraph, while later sections and the conclusion received less comprehensive attention and revision.
- **Depth of Critical Evaluation:** The student could further engage in reasoning about why or why not to accept AI feedback, providing more detailed justifications for revisions rather than simple confirmation of AI suggestions.
- **Grammar and Sentence Structure:** Some awkward or direct translation errors remain; continued practice in English academic style, use of complex structures, and proofreading would strengthen clarity.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good – The student re-stated the prompt multiple times and responded to diagnostic feedback, but course-specific or learning objectives were not explicitly discussed.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good – Prioritized thesis and organization focus per AI guidance; actively participated in stepwise revision process.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Developing – Mostly accepted suggestions with little further critical analysis; some self-driven revision, especially in body paragraph clarification, but critical review could deepen.
- **Independent Editing**: Good – Attempted own rewrites incorporating suggestions, especially in first body paragraph and examples, but less confident or direct editing later in the essay.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing Skills**: Continue to practice revising all essay sections, not just the introduction and one body paragraph. Focus on developing strong topic sentences and supporting details in every paragraph, and ensure clarity and unity from beginning to end.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills**: Aim for more active critical review—explain why you accept or modify AI suggestions; propose alternatives or ask for variations as needed; more consistently apply feedback across the essay.
3. **Overall Improvement**: Proofread for grammar, word choice, and sentence structure especially in later paragraphs; seek feedback on conclusion crafting; independently attempt stronger revisions before finalizing with AI help.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES

- The student made strong improvements in thesis clarity and first body paragraph structure, actively using AI coaching for guided rewriting and sentence development. However, full essay revision should cover each paragraph and the conclusion for maximum impact. Encourage the student to explain their rationale for accepting/rejecting AI suggestions and deepen the revision cycle for stronger metacognitive skills. Additional language support may be beneficial for grammar and academic phrasing in later sections.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
As what the background said, automation is developing quickly and changes all kinds of jobs` structure any time. But due to this question. my answer is "No". In this essay. I will explain my reasons from both direct and indirect side. I think it will undermine in the long term.
Althouah the question asks me the technological shift in the long term, I would like to communicate about short term first and that is indirect side I do show you the merits in short term, rather than long term. Due to today's background, many regions still live in a developing semester so there must be many hard and dangerous work that nobody likes to do. In that way. the technological automation can help us. For example, dealing with the plenty of rubbish and chemical waste can be typical scenes. There are more living examples, such as airport package transfermation and so on.
All in all, in the short term, the technological shift makes our life more convenient and high quanlity.


Time runs quickly soon. When the whole world lives in a developed level, every thing will change. With the deep development of automation.. it nearly can do all the things. There is no need that employee can just use high technological automation to run the community. At that time, if the population is still large, many people can not find the job. Although the community has a high effiency, few people can enjoy the comfortable period.

First and foremost , although the techonogical automation can improve the effienay at all, the economic society will lead to a higher and higher effiency, maybe no stop. I think we should control the balance and let people as host forever.

Revised:
As what the background said, automation is developing quickly . Although automation increases efficiency, it will ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term because it replaces many traditional jobs and increases economic inequality. I think it will undermine in the long term.In this essay. I will explain my reasons from both direct and indirect side.

One major reason automation undermines global employment prospects is that it replaces many traditional jobs with machines and modern technologies.Today, in many developing regions, a large number of people rely on basic or manual jobs to earn a living. However, as businesses introduce automation to increase profits and efficiency, they require fewer workers for these types of jobs. For example, in waste management, machines now process rubbish and chemical waste that humans previously handled, reducing available positions. Another example is airport package handling, where automated systems have replaced many workers who used to sort and move luggage. These changes show that automation is increasingly replacing traditional jobs and reducing employment opportunities in various industries.


Another important reason automation undermines the global outlook for employment is that it fuels economic inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Automation creates new opportunities mainly for highly skilled employees, such as engineers or computer programmers, while eliminating many positions for less-skilled workers. People who lose their jobs to automation often lack the training or resources needed to transition to new types of work. For instance, when companies in the manufacturing industry introduce robots, they still need specialists to maintain the machines, yet most of the jobs on the assembly line disappear. Therefore, the economic gap widens, with many people facing long-term unemployment or lower wages. This proves that automation not only reduces jobs overall but also increases inequality within the global workforce.

In conclusion, while automation offers many advantages to modern industries, it poses significant risks to global employment in the long run. Unless proactive measures are taken to help workers adapt, automation will continue to eliminate traditional jobs and increase inequality. It is vital for societies to find ways to balance efficiency gains with opportunities for people, ensuring that progress does not leave anyone behind.

**Assistant:** Great! Thanks for confirming you’d like to focus on:

- **Thesis & Argument** (making your main point clear and strong)
- **Organization** (improving paragraph structure and flow)

Let’s begin our Three-Step Revision Process!

---

## **Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**

**First, please copy and paste your current thesis statement below.**
(If you aren’t sure which is your thesis, it’s usually the main sentence at the end of your introduction that answers the essay question.)

Example from your draft:
> "But due to this question. my answer is 'No.' In this essay. I will explain my reasons from both direct and indirect side. I think it will undermine in the long term."

**Let’s look at this together:**
- The position is not very clear (what will technology *undermine*?).
- The language can be more direct and academic.
- It should briefly preview your main reasons or approach.

**Before you revise:**  
Remember, a strong thesis should:

- Directly answer: *Will automation ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term?*
- Clearly state your opinion: (Enhance OR Undermine?)
- Preview your key reasons (e.g., job loss, inequality, new job creation, economic growth, etc.)

**Guiding questions:**

1. Do you believe automation will create more jobs than it destroys *in the long term*? Or the opposite?
2. What are your two main reasons for taking that position? (For example: “While automation brings efficiency, it eliminates traditional jobs and increases inequality.”)

**Can you try to write a new thesis statement based on your real opinion?**  
Feel free to draft it here—don’t worry, we’ll edit together!

*(Would you like to try your revised thesis? If you get stuck, I'll help with questions or examples!)*

*Time:* 2025-11-16T07:41:16.459Z

**You:** Please change the topic

*Time:* 2025-11-16T07:42:23.550Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! It's important to clarify the topic before we start revision. Thank you for letting me know you’d like the topic changed.

---

## **STEP 1: Confirming Your New Essay Topic**

**Could you please tell me:**
- What new topic do you want for your essay?
- Is there a prompt or question your teacher gave, or would you like to choose one yourself?

If you have a prompt, paste it here. If you’d like, I can suggest a few topics commonly used in academic writing—just let me know your preference!

---

### **Some Examples:**
- Should universities require all students to study abroad?
- Is online learning as effective as traditional classroom education?
- Do social media platforms have a positive or negative impact on society?
- Should governments invest more in renewable energy?

**Let me know which topic you prefer, or provide your own!**  
Once you confirm the new topic, we'll re-start the diagnostic review and revision workflow, tailored to your essay!

---

*(Would you like to choose one of these, or share your own topic?)*

*Time:* 2025-11-16T07:42:26.371Z

**You:** Automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. Does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term?

*Time:* 2025-11-16T07:42:57.149Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for confirming your new essay topic:

**"Automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. Does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term?"**

You’d like to focus on:
- **Thesis & Argument** (making your main point clear and strong)
- **Organization** (improving paragraph structure and flow)

Let's begin Step 1!

---

## **STEP 1 — Thesis Statement Revision**

Your original thesis area was:

> "But due to this question, my answer is 'No.' In this essay, I will explain my reasons from both direct and indirect side. I think it will undermine in the long term."

**Let's improve it together!**

### **Feedback:**
- The position is a bit unclear: What exactly is undermined?
- "Direct and indirect side" is vague.
- The thesis does not preview your main reasons.
- Avoid phrases like "I think"—be confident and precise.

#### **Guiding Questions:**
1. Do you believe automation will **enhance** or **undermine** employment prospects worldwide in the long term?
2. What are the TWO most important reasons for your position?

_For example: Will automation increase inequality, cause mass unemployment, or create new jobs?_

### **Attempt a New Thesis Statement!**
Try to write your thesis below using this template:

> "Although automation boosts efficiency, it ultimately **[enhances/undermines]** global employment prospects in the long term because **[reason 1]** and **[reason 2]**."

**Would you like to try writing a new thesis using your opinion and two main reasons?**

---

*Feel free to respond with your new thesis statement below. If you’d like hints or suggestions, just ask!*

*Time:* 2025-11-16T07:43:01.831Z

**You:** As what the background said, automation is developing quickly and changes all kinds of jobs` structure any time. But due to this question. my answer is "No". In this essay. I will explain my reasons from both direct and indirect side. I think it will undermine in the long term.

*Time:* 2025-11-16T07:44:09.088Z

**Assistant:** Great work getting started! Let’s focus on making your **thesis statement** clear, specific, and strong—just as you requested.  

### **Feedback on Original Thesis:**

> "But due to this question. my answer is 'No'. In this essay. I will explain my reasons from both direct and indirect side. I think it will undermine in the long term."

#### Let’s break down what needs improving:
- The **position** (“No”) is there, but it’s unclear what it refers to (undermine employment, I assume).
- “Direct and indirect side” is vague and not academic in tone.
- You mention the “long term,” but don’t preview your main reasons.
- It’s best to avoid “I think”—try to sound confident!
- A strong thesis should **directly answer** the prompt and clearly preview the two main reasons that you’ll discuss in your body paragraphs.

---

## **Guiding Questions before you revise:**
1. **Your opinion:**  
   Do you believe automation will hurt (“undermine”) jobs around the world most in the long term, or will it help (“enhance”) them?
2. **Your two main reasons:**  
   What are the biggest reasons for your answer? For example:
   - “It will cause more unemployment by replacing human workers.”
   - “It will increase inequality.”
   - “It can create new types of jobs.”
   - “It may ultimately lead to more overall employment.”

Try to state your main opinion and your two strongest reasons.

---

## **Example Template for Your Thesis:**  
(Just as a starting point – try your own version!)
> Although automation increases efficiency, it will ultimately **undermine** global employment prospects in the long term because it replaces many human jobs and increases economic inequality.

Or:
> In the long term, automation will **undermine** global employment because it will eliminate traditional jobs faster than it creates new ones and may make it harder for less-skilled workers to find work.

### **Your Turn!**

**Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement now?**  
(Type your new thesis below! If you aren’t sure how to start, just share your opinion and reasons in your own words, and I’ll help you shape them.)

Let’s do it together—you try, then I’ll coach!

*Time:* 2025-11-16T07:44:15.440Z

**You:** Help me to revise the statement

*Time:* 2025-11-16T07:45:25.197Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let’s revise your thesis statement **step by step**.

First, let’s be clear and confident.  
The prompt asks:  
> Does automation ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term?

From your earlier draft, your opinion is **“No”—it undermines employment prospects**.

Let’s clarify your two main reasons. Based on your essay, some possible reasons are:

- **Job loss** (automation replaces many jobs)
- **Inequality or lack of opportunity** (not everyone can benefit)
- (You also mention some short-term benefits, but focus on the long-term for the thesis.)

Here’s a template to start:

> Although automation improves efficiency, it ultimately undermines global employment prospects in the long term because [reason 1] and [reason 2].

Now, let’s try to fill it in using your ideas.  
Based on your writing, maybe:

- It replaces traditional jobs.
- It may lead to greater inequality or unemployment.

**Would you like to try writing your revised thesis here?**

You can use this template, or write your own:

> In the long term, automation will undermine global employment because it replaces many human jobs and many people may not find new opportunities.

**Type your version below, and I’ll give you feedback to make it even stronger!**

*Ready to try? Go ahead and post your new thesis statement. If you feel stuck, just list your opinion and two reasons in any way, and I’ll help you shape them!*

*Time:* 2025-11-16T07:45:29.704Z

**You:** As what the background said, automation is developing quickly and changes all kinds of jobs` structure any time. But due to this question. my answer is "No". In this essay. I will explain my reasons from both direct and indirect side. I think it will undermine in the long term.

*Time:* 2025-11-16T07:46:10.348Z

**Assistant:** Great—thank you for posting your current thesis statement! Let’s work together to make it stronger.

### **Feedback on Your Thesis Statement**

Here’s your original thesis:

> As what the background said, automation is developing quickly and changes all kinds of jobs' structure any time. But due to this question. my answer is "No". In this essay. I will explain my reasons from both direct and indirect side. I think it will undermine in the long term.

#### **What’s Good:**
- You express your position (No—I think it will undermine in the long term).
- You mention the topic (automation affecting jobs).

#### **Can Be Improved:**
- The language is vague and indirect ("my answer is 'No'", "direct and indirect side").
- The thesis should be one clear, confident sentence.
- It should **directly answer the prompt** and **preview your main reasons**.

---

### **Revision Time!**

Let’s try to write a new thesis statement together.

#### **Here’s a step-by-step guide:**

1. **Directly answer the prompt.**  
   - Do you believe automation ultimately **undermines** global employment prospects in the long term?  
   *(It sounds like you do!)*

2. **Preview your two main reasons.**  
   - From your essay, maybe:  
     - Automation replaces many human jobs.  
     - It increases unemployment or inequality in society.

#### **Template Example:**  
> Although automation increases efficiency, it will ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term because it replaces many traditional jobs and increases economic inequality.

---

#### **Your Turn!**

**Try to write your revised thesis using your words and your two main reasons.**
You can use the template above, or write it in your own way!

**Would you like to try your version here?**  
*(When you’re ready, type your revised thesis statement, and I’ll help you polish it even more!)*

If you get stuck, tell me your reasons and I’ll suggest a sentence. You’ve got this—give it a try!

*Time:* 2025-11-16T07:46:15.727Z

**You:** As what the background said, automation is developing quickly and changes all kinds of jobs` structure any time. Although automation increases efficiency, it will ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term because it replaces many traditional jobs and increases economic inequality. I think it will undermine in the long term.In this essay. I will explain my reasons from both direct and indirect side.

*Time:* 2025-11-16T07:49:25.914Z

**Assistant:** Excellent effort! You’re clearly working to make your thesis statement stronger and more focused. Let’s refine it a little more for clarity, confidence, and academic style.

---

### Feedback on Your Revised Thesis Draft

Your attempt:
> Although automation increases efficiency, it will ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term because it replaces many traditional jobs and increases economic inequality.

This is MUCH clearer and stronger than your original! Well done.

**A few suggestions to make it even better:**
- **Keep your thesis ONE clear sentence:** Avoid repeating the same idea after (“I think it will undermine…”).
- **Be confident:** Omit phrases like “I think” or “In this essay I will explain…”
- **Focus on specificity:** You’ve already stated your two main reasons—great!
- **Connect to the essay prompt:** Use “undermine global employment prospects” directly in the thesis.

---

### Strong, Final Thesis Version

Here’s a polished version based on your draft:

> Although automation increases efficiency, it will ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term because it replaces many traditional jobs and increases economic inequality.

*Time:* 2025-11-16T07:50:32.282Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic! You’ve confirmed your revised thesis statement:

> **Although automation increases efficiency, it will ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term because it replaces many traditional jobs and increases economic inequality.**

This is clear, confident, and directly previews your argument—excellent work!

---

## **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**

Now, let’s focus on the **topic sentence** of your first body paragraph.

Please copy and paste the topic sentence (the very first sentence) of your first body paragraph here.

From your draft, the first body paragraph begins with this sentence:

> Althouah the question asks me the technological shift in the long term, I would like to communicate about short term first and that is indirect side I do show you the merits in short term, rather than long term.

### **Feedback on This Topic Sentence:**
- It’s a bit unclear and off-topic since your thesis focuses on the **long-term** negative impact.
- It should connect directly to your thesis—specifically your first main reason (automation replaces traditional jobs).

### **Goal:**  
Write a topic sentence that introduces the paragraph’s main idea and links it to your thesis.

**Guiding questions:**  
1. Is this paragraph about how automation replaces traditional jobs?  
2. Can you state directly how automation affects employment in this way?

### **Example Structure:**  
> One major reason automation undermines global employment is that it replaces many traditional jobs with machines and technology.

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now?**

- Try to clearly introduce that the paragraph is about automation replacing traditional jobs (your first main point).
- Once you have a new version, post it here and I’ll help you polish it!

**You:** Althouah the question asks me the technological shift in the long term, I would like to communicate about short term first and that is indirect side I do show you the merits in short term, rather than long term.

*Time:* 2025-11-16T07:53:35.470Z

**Assistant:** Great job sharing your original topic sentence! Let’s work together to make it much clearer, directly connected to your thesis, and focused on your first main reason: **how automation replaces traditional jobs in the long term**.

---

## **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision — Feedback**

**Your current topic sentence:**
> Althouah the question asks me the technological shift in the long term, I would like to communicate about short term first and that is indirect side I do show you the merits in short term, rather than long term.

#### **What needs improvement:**
- The sentence is off-topic (it focuses on the short term, but your thesis is about the long-term negative impact).
- The language is quite unclear and doesn’t introduce your first main reason.
- There is no strong link to your thesis about **job replacement**.

---

## **Goal:**  
Write a **clear** topic sentence that signals this paragraph is about the negative effect of automation *replacing traditional jobs in the long term*, just as your thesis previewed.

### **Guiding Questions:**
- How does automation negatively affect jobs in the long term?
- Can you state directly: “Automation replaces many traditional jobs”?

---

## **Try this process:**

**Step 1:** Start with a phrase that shows this is a “reason.”  
E.g., “The main reason automation undermines global employment is…”

**Step 2:** Name your point clearly.  
E.g., “…it replaces many traditional jobs with machines.”

**Step 3:** Optional — briefly connect to your thesis.  
E.g., “This process can result in fewer opportunities for workers overall.”

---

## **Model Examples** (use for hints, not copying!):

- **One major reason automation undermines global employment prospects is that it replaces many traditional jobs with machines and technology.**
- **In the long term, automation is likely to replace many traditional jobs, which reduces employment opportunities for workers worldwide.**

---

## **Your Turn!**

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now?**
- You can start with your own version, or use the guiding structure above.
- Remember: focus on your first main reason, and make it clear for your reader.

**Type your revised topic sentence below. If you want help or feedback, just ask!**

*Time:* 2025-11-16T07:53:44.286Z

**You:** One major reason automation undermines global employment prospects is that it replaces many traditional jobs with those automatic technology.

*Time:* 2025-11-16T08:20:53.745Z

**Assistant:** Excellent work! Your revised topic sentence is clear and directly connected to both your thesis and your first main reason.

**Here’s your draft:**
> One major reason automation undermines global employment prospects is that it replaces many traditional jobs with those automatic technology.

**Feedback & Suggestions for Small Improvements:**
- Instead of “those automatic technology,” let’s try “machines and new technologies” for more natural phrasing.
- "Automatic technology" is a bit awkward; "automation technologies" or "machines and technology" sounds more academic.
- Otherwise, your sentence structure is strong!

**Polished version (for you to consider):**
> One major reason automation undermines global employment prospects is that it replaces many traditional jobs with machines and modern technologies.

**Would you like to use this version, or would you like to try revising it yourself one more time?  
If you're happy, just confirm! If you'd like to tweak it, please type your new version and I'll help adjust it.**

---

**Next step: Once your topic sentence is confirmed, we’ll move on to revising the supporting sentences in this paragraph.**

Would you like to finalize your topic sentence now?

*Time:* 2025-11-16T08:20:58.615Z

**You:** confirm

*Time:* 2025-11-16T08:22:17.687Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! Your topic sentence is now clear, confident, and logically connected to your thesis.

---

## **Your Confirmed Topic Sentence:**
> One major reason automation undermines global employment prospects is that it replaces many traditional jobs with machines and modern technologies.

---

Now let’s move into **Step 3: Revising the Rest of the Chosen Paragraph** (your first body paragraph).  
We’ll improve the supporting sentences for clarity, unity, and coherence, focusing on how examples and explanations support your revised topic sentence.

Here is your **current first body paragraph** (with the new topic sentence inserted):

---

### **Body Paragraph 1 (Current Version):**
One major reason automation undermines global employment prospects is that it replaces many traditional jobs with machines and modern technologies. Due to today's background, many regions still live in a developing semester so there must be many hard and dangerous work that nobody likes to do. In that way. the technological automation can help us. For example, dealing with the plenty of rubbish and chemical waste can be typical scenes. There are more living examples, such as airport package transfermation and so on.  
All in all, in the short term, the technological shift makes our life more convenient and high quanlity.

---

### **Revision Questions & Feedback**
Let’s make the paragraph:
- *Clearly focused on the main idea (job replacement)*
- *Evidence and explanation support your topic sentence*
- *Sentences are clear and connected*
- *Unnecessary ideas (too much about short-term benefits) are removed or linked*

#### **Guiding Questions:**
1. Do your examples (rubbish, airport, etc.) clearly show *job replacement*? Can you make this connection more obvious?
2. Is there an explanation of how automation, even in developing regions, replaces human workers in dangerous or hard jobs?
3. Are all your sentences connected, or do some need smoother transitions (e.g., “For example…” or “As a result…”)?  
4. Are there sentences that don't relate closely enough to your topic sentence?

---

### **Your Turn!**
**Would you like to try revising one or two sentences for more clarity and connection to your topic sentence?**
- For example: Expand on *how* automation replaces jobs, even "hard and dangerous work," and *why* this affects overall employment.
- You might clarify your examples: “For example, in waste management, machines now do the work that humans once did, reducing those job opportunities.”

**Write your revised sentences here, and I’ll provide feedback and help you polish them!**

---

#### *If you prefer, I can suggest a simple revision for one sentence. Just let me know!*  
Let me know when you’re ready to try revising this paragraph—one sentence at a time works great if you prefer!

---

### **Encouragement:**
- You're doing great—focus on **how** your examples show job replacement, and connect each one to your topic sentence.
- Remember, every supporting sentence should help prove your main point!

---

Would you like to try revising the supporting sentences now? Start with your waste management example, and let's make the connection to job replacement clear!

*Time:* 2025-11-16T08:22:23.599Z

**You:** Due to today's background, many regions still live in a developing semester so there must be many simple people waiting for the easy work to do . Because of the automation and profits, people turn to enhance the effiency and need few cheap labors. For example, dealing with the plenty of rubbish and chemical waste can be typical scenes. There are more living examples, such as airport package transfermation and so on.

*Time:* 2025-11-16T08:30:59.804Z

**Assistant:** Great job trying to clarify your ideas in these supporting sentences! You’re clearly explaining that automation is reducing the need for human workers, especially in certain types of jobs. Let’s focus on making the sentences **more clear, logical, and directly connected to your topic sentence**.

---

## **Let’s Review Your Sentences**
> Due to today's background, many regions still live in a developing semester so there must be many simple people waiting for the easy work to do. Because of the automation and profits, people turn to enhance the effiency and need few cheap labors. For example, dealing with the plenty of rubbish and chemical waste can be typical scenes. There are more living examples, such as airport package transfermation and so on.

### **Feedback & Guiding Questions:**
- “Developing semester” is not clear—do you mean “developing regions/countries”?
- “Simple people waiting for easy work to do” could be rephrased more academically (“Many people rely on basic or manual jobs”).
- Show **how** automation *replaces* these jobs, not just improves efficiency.
- Examples (rubbish, airport package transformation) need to be connected more clearly to **job replacement**.

*Time:* 2025-11-16T08:31:09.123Z

**You:** Due to today’s background, many regions still live in the period of development so there must be many people rely on basic or manual jobs to do . As businesses introduce automation to increase profits and efficiency, they require fewer workers for these types of jobs. For example, in waste management, machines now process rubbish and chemical waste previously handled by humans, reducing available positions. Another example is airport package handling, where automated systems have replaced many workers who used to sort and move luggage.

## **Polishing and Feedback**

**Strengths:**
- The paragraph is clearly focused on how automation replaces traditional jobs.
- Supporting details and examples (waste management, airport handling) are specific and relevant.
- Logical flow from general situation (developing regions) to direct impact and concrete examples.

**Areas to tweak (for grammar, cohesion, and academic tone):**

1. **First sentence:** Try to join ideas for smoother flow and correct the grammar.
2. **General to specific:** Use linking words (“For example,” “Additionally,” etc.) to connect ideas.
3. **Final sentence:** Consider a short concluding sentence tying back to your main claim.

## **Suggested Final Version (for you to use or further edit):**

> Today, in many developing regions, a large number of people rely on basic or manual jobs to earn a living. However, as businesses introduce automation to increase profits and efficiency, they require fewer workers for these types of jobs. For example, in waste management, machines now process rubbish and chemical waste that humans previously handled, reducing available positions. Another example is airport package handling, where automated systems have replaced many workers who used to sort and move luggage. These changes show that automation is increasingly replacing traditional jobs and reducing employment opportunities in various industries.

**Although automation increases efficiency, it will ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term because it replaces many traditional jobs and increases economic inequality.**

One major reason automation undermines global employment prospects is that it replaces many traditional jobs with machines and modern technologies. Today, in many developing regions, a large number of people rely on basic or manual jobs to earn a living. However, as businesses introduce automation to increase profits and efficiency, they require fewer workers for these types of jobs. For example, in waste management, machines now process rubbish and chemical waste that humans previously handled, reducing available positions. Another example is airport package handling, where automated systems have replaced many workers who used to sort and move luggage. These changes show that automation is increasingly replacing traditional jobs and reducing employment opportunities in various industries.

Time runs quickly soon. When the whole world lives in a developed level, everything will change. With the deep development of automation, it nearly can do all things. There is no need that employee can just use high technological automation to run the community. At that time, if the population is still large, many people cannot find jobs. Although the community has high efficiency, few people can enjoy the comfortable period.

First and foremost, although technological automation can improve the efficiency overall, the economic society will lead to higher and higher efficiency, maybe no stop. We should control the balance and let people be host forever.

You are doing excellent work—your essay is becoming clearer, more logical, and academic. Keep practicing, and let me know how I can help further!

*Time:* 2025-11-16T08:36:42.021Z

**You:** 帮助我写一下另外一个观点

*Time:* 2025-11-16T08:42:32.572Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely, I’d be delighted to help you write another body paragraph (“另一个观点”) for your essay, following your thesis and focus on **organization and argument strength**. Since your thesis is:

> Although automation increases efficiency, it will ultimately undermine global employment prospects in the long term because it replaces many traditional jobs and increases economic inequality.

You already have a paragraph about **job replacement**. For your second main point (“increases economic inequality”), let’s build a new paragraph step by step.

---

## Step 1: Topic Sentence for the New Paragraph

First, your topic sentence should:

- Clearly state your second main reason: **Automation increases economic inequality**, which contributes to undermining global employment prospects.
- Directly link to your thesis.
- Avoid vague words; be confident and academic.

**Template:**  
> Another important reason automation undermines global employment prospects is that it increases economic inequality between skilled and unskilled workers.

**Would you like to try writing your own topic sentence for this paragraph?**  
If you’re not sure, you can use or slightly change the template above.

---

## Step 2: Supporting Sentences

To support this idea, you need to:

- Explain **how** automation can increase the gap between high- and low-skilled workers.
- Show why this means not everyone benefits equally, and some people are left behind.
- Provide an example, such as technology companies needing highly-educated workers, while less-educated workers lose jobs.

### **Guiding Questions:**

1. **Why** does automation benefit some people more than others?
2. **What happens** to workers without advanced skills?
3. **Is there an example** (from a specific industry or country) where automation has led to greater inequality?

---

## Step 3: Try Building the Paragraph

Let’s attempt to put your ideas together!  
Here is a model structure you can try to complete in your own words:

---

**Topic Sentence:**  
Another important reason automation undermines global employment prospects is that it increases economic inequality between skilled and unskilled workers.

**Supporting sentences (expand):**

- Automation mostly creates demand for highly-skilled workers, such as engineers or programmers, but it often eliminates jobs that require less education or training.
- Many people who lose their jobs because of automation do not have the skills or resources to move into new, better-paying positions.
- For example, in factories that introduce robots, managers and technicians are still needed, but most assembly line workers lose their positions.
- As a result, the gap between those who benefit from automation and those who are hurt by it continues to grow.

**Optional concluding sentence:**  
This growing inequality means that automation does not improve employment prospects for everyone, and many workers are left with fewer opportunities.

---

## Step 4: Your Turn!

**Would you like to try writing the supporting sentences yourself—following this structure?**  
If you want, you can write 1-2 sentences at a time, and I’ll give feedback as you go.

If you prefer, you may also use the paragraph above as a base and adapt it to your own style!

---

### Full Example Paragraph (for you to adapt, not just copy):

> Another important reason automation undermines global employment prospects is that it increases economic inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Automation creates new opportunities mainly for highly skilled employees, such as engineers or computer programmers, while eliminating many positions for less-skilled workers. People who lose their jobs to automation often lack the training or resources needed to transition to new types of work. For example, when companies in the manufacturing industry introduce robots, they still need specialists to maintain the machines, but many assembly line jobs disappear. As a result, the economic gap grows wider, and many people face long-term unemployment or lower wages. This shows that automation not only reduces jobs overall but also increases inequality in the global workforce.

---

## Next Steps:

- **You try:** Write your version of the paragraph.  
- **I’ll help:** I’ll coach you on clarity, structure, and language!

**Would you like to try now? Just start with 1-2 sentences if you prefer!**

*Time:* 2025-11-16T08:42:46.784Z

**You:** First and foremost , although the techonogical automation can improve the effienay at all, the economic society will lead to a higher and higher effiency, maybe no stop. I think we should control the balance and let people as host forever.

*Time:* 2025-11-16T09:26:20.443Z

**Assistant:** Great job attempting your second main paragraph! Let’s work together—step by step—to make it **clearer, stronger, and more academic**.

---

## **Your Draft:**
> First and foremost , although the techonogical automation can improve the effienay at all, the economic society will lead to a higher and higher effiency, maybe no stop. I think we should control the balance and let people as host forever.

---

## **Feedback:**
- The topic sentence is **unclear** and needs to state your second main reason: how automation increases economic inequality.
- "Effienay" and "at all" are confusing—maybe you meant "efficiency."
- "Economic society will lead to a higher and higher efficiency, maybe no stop" is unclear and vague.
- The last sentence ("let people as host forever") needs a clearer connection to the main argument.

Your thesis previewed: **automation increases economic inequality**.  
Let's make sure your paragraph shows **how and why** this happens, with specific explanation and example.

---

## **Step 1: Revise Your Topic Sentence**

**Would you like to try?** Use this template as a guide:

> Another important reason automation undermines global employment prospects is that it increases economic inequality between skilled and unskilled workers.

**Try writing your version now, and I’ll help you polish it!**

---

## **Step 2: Support Your Topic Sentence**

Let’s answer these guiding questions:
- **How** does automation make the gap between skilled and unskilled workers wider?
- **What happens** to workers who lose jobs because of machines or technology?
- **Is there an example** of a workplace/industry where this happened?

**Try writing 1-2 supporting sentences.** For example:
- “Automation creates more jobs for highly skilled workers, such as engineers, but removes positions for less-skilled employees, increasing inequality.”
- “Often, workers who lose their jobs do not have the resources or education to get new jobs in technical fields.”

---

## **Step 3: Add an Example**

“ For example, in factories that use robots, technicians and engineers may keep their jobs, but many assembly line workers are replaced and can’t find new work.”

---

## **Step 4: Concluding Sentence (Optional)**

“This growing inequality means that automation does not help all workers equally and leaves many people with fewer opportunities.”

---

## **Your Turn!**
