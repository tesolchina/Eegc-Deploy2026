            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your final assessment report and chat history! Here is a concise summary and guidance based on that information:

---

### Summary of Your Revision Process and Outcomes

- **Thesis**: You replaced your original vague, ungrammatical thesis with a clear, confident one that previews reasons:  
  *“Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrants' rights because stronger regulation reduces exploitation, ensures fair pay and reasonable hours, and preserves social stability.”*

- **Topic Sentence**: You chose a focused topic sentence that links directly to your thesis and guides the paragraph:  
  *“Because employers can hire migrants at lower wages and demand longer hours where labor protections are weak, native-born workers often face higher unemployment.”*

- **Paragraph Revision**: Your supporting paragraph was revised for grammar, clarity, and coherence. Problems like run-ons, awkward phrasing, articles, and word choice were corrected while maintaining your original ideas. The revised paragraph explains the chart’s data and argues logically from weak regulation to exploitation and social consequences.

- **Collaboration**: You actively engaged by drafting multiple thesis and topic sentence versions, selecting model options thoughtfully, and requesting focused grammar help at the paragraph level.

---

### Key Strengths

- Clear, confident thesis that previews main ideas  
- Focused topic sentence linking cause and effect clearly  
- Improved grammatical accuracy and sentence clarity  
- Logical coherence in paragraph organization  
- Iterative revision process shows good use of AI guidance and self-editing  

---

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Use Concrete Evidence**  
   Add explicit data or figures from the chart to support your claims, e.g.:  
   *“The chart shows that in X countries, unemployment among native-born workers is Y% higher than among migrants, illustrating how weak labor protections impact employment.”*  
   This strengthens argument credibility and ties analysis more closely to evidence.

2. **Deepen Causal Explanation**  
   Expand briefly on how weak enforcement enables exploitation—mention lack of inspections, informal work, or policy loopholes—to make your causal chain more precise and convincing.

3. **Polish Style and Concision**  
   Revise remaining awkward or wordy phrases. For example, instead of:  
   *“the laws can focus on the minimum amount of salary or the maximum amount of the worktime,”*  
   you might say:  
   *“the laws should set and enforce minimum wages and maximum working hours.”*  
   Reading aloud your essay and checking idiomatic expressions can help.

4. **Practice Independent Editing**  
   Before requesting AI corrections, try one round of self-editing to catch issues and highlight outstanding concerns for more focused AI feedback.

---

### Overall Evaluation

Your engagement and openness to revision led to significant improvement in idea clarity, organization, vocabulary, and grammar. You skillfully incorporated AI suggestions while maintaining your authorial voice. With further practice integrating evidence and refining style, your writing will gain even greater authority and fluency.

Fantastic progress—keep building on these strengths and targeted recommendations!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The student takes a clear position (supports stricter laws) and mentions causes and consequences, but ideas are underdeveloped and sometimes illogical (e.g., broad causal claims about population loss) with little explanation or evidence linking the chart to claims. Example: "The unique identity makes the migrants suffering low income while doing long time, heavy works..." shows intent but weak development.
- Organization: 15/25 - Paragraphing is attemptive but repetitive and unfocused; sentences run together and lack clear topic sentences and transitions (e.g., several claims about causes and consequences are repeated rather than developed).
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Shows some variety of topic vocabulary (exploitation, unemployed, migrants) but frequent inaccurate word choices and collocations (e.g., "can be owe to," "make a live," "high cost-effect").
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 14/25 - Frequent errors in articles, verb forms, possessives, and sentence boundaries that impede clarity (e.g., "To my opinion," "migrants right," run-on sentences).
- **Original Essay Total: 61/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised essay has a clearer, confident thesis that previews reasons: "Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrants' rights because stronger regulation reduces exploitation, ensures fair pay and reasonable hours, and preserves social stability." The argument is more coherent and focuses on exploitation, wages, hours, and social stability. Still, analysis remains general and lacks concrete data from the chart or more precise examples.
- Organization: 22/25 - Paragraph structure improved: a clear topic sentence was inserted ("Because employers can hire migrants at lower wages and demand longer hours...") and supporting sentences follow a logical cause–effect sequence. Transitions and paragraph unity are much stronger.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Vocabulary and collocations improved ("may be linked to," "cost-effective," "make a living"), though a few awkward phrasings remain in places (e.g., "the laws can focus on the minimum amount of salary or the maximum amount of the worktime" could be more idiomatic).
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 21/25 - Major grammar and punctuation issues were corrected; run-ons were broken into clearer sentences, articles and possessives fixed (e.g., "migrants' rights"). A few stylistic and phrasing issues remain but overall accuracy and sentence variety improved.
- **Revised Essay Total: 84/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +23 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clear, confident thesis replacing the original weak sentence ("To my opinion...") with: "Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrants' rights because stronger regulation reduces exploitation, ensures fair pay and reasonable hours, and preserves social stability."
  - Stronger topic sentence linking evidence to thesis: "Because employers can hire migrants at lower wages and demand longer hours where labor protections are weak, native-born workers often face higher unemployment."
  - Substantial grammatical and clarity edits in the targeted paragraph: chart reference clarified ("The chart shows that in many countries unemployment among native-born workers is higher than among migrants, which may be linked to weak regulations.") and sentences restructured for logical progression.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Use of the chart: the essay references the chart but does not cite specific figures or explain how the chart's data support the causal claims—adding concrete numbers or a brief explanation would strengthen evidence.
  - Deeper causal analysis: explanations of employer incentives and policy mechanisms could be more specific (e.g., legal loopholes, enforcement gaps, minimum wage differentials).
  - Style polish: some sentences in the revised essay remain slightly awkward or non-idiomatic and could be tightened (e.g., rephrase "the laws can focus on the minimum amount of salary or the maximum amount of the worktime").

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 23**
- **Conversation Quality:** High-quality, scaffolded interaction. The assistant provided a clear three-step revision plan, model thesis options, and iterative feedback. The student actively engaged—attempting their own revisions, choosing model options (chose Option 1 for thesis and Option B for the topic sentence), and requesting grammar revision. The assistant implemented targeted edits and explained changes.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - The chat shows sustained, stepwise interaction across 23 messages, with multiple rounds of drafting, feedback, and revision. The assistant provided structured guidance (thesis options, topic-sentence models, a revision plan) and the student iterated several times.
  - Evidence: Assistant laid out Step 1–3 plan; the student responded, produced multiple thesis/topic-sentence drafts, and the assistant returned revised paragraph text.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - The student exercised some critical judgment: they tried their own thesis and topic-sentence revisions, selected preferred model options (chose "Use Option 1" for thesis and "Option B" for the topic sentence), and requested focused grammar corrections rather than accepting everything uncritically. However, most final accepting choices were guided by the assistant, and explicit rejection or deep critique of specific AI suggestions was limited.
  - Examples: Student tried multiple topic-sentence drafts and accepted "Option B"; student asked the assistant to revise grammar, showing selective acceptance and delegation.
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - There is clear iterative refinement: initial diagnosis → model thesis options → student drafts → assistant feedback → student chooses option → topic-sentence drafting and selection → paragraph grammar revision → final paragraph inserted. Multiple meaningful revision cycles occurred.
  - Evidence: Series of attempts at the topic sentence (student drafts, assistant models) followed by a final grammar revision producing the revised paragraph.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear uptake of AI guidance: the student accepted a stronger thesis and a focused topic sentence and allowed targeted grammatical revision, resulting in a substantially clearer paragraph and improved essay coherence.
  - Evidence: Revised thesis and paragraph included in final essay; assistant’s final paragraph shows corrected grammar and logical flow.
- Active participation and iteration: the student drafted multiple versions and responded to focused prompts, which improved writing through an iterative process.
  - Evidence: Student-generated thesis attempts and multiple topic-sentence drafts in chat.
- Awareness of argument structure: after guidance, the student organized ideas into cause (weak laws) → mechanism (employers hire migrants cheaply) → effects (unemployment, instability), aligning with the thesis.
  - Evidence: Final paragraph follows that causal structure.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Use of concrete evidence: incorporate specific data or clearer reference to the chart (e.g., state the figures or describe the chart’s categories) to substantiate the central claim.
  - Recommendation: Add one sentence with concrete numbers from the chart or a short interpretation (e.g., "The chart shows X% native unemployment vs Y% migrant unemployment in Z countries").
- Deepen causal explanation: explain enforcement mechanisms, policy gaps, or economic incentives in more detail to strengthen the causal chain.
  - Recommendation: Provide one or two brief examples of how weak enforcement allows wage undercutting (e.g., informal work arrangements, lack of inspections).
- Style and concision: polish remaining awkward or wordy sentences to improve fluency and register.
  - Recommendation: Replace phrases like "the laws can focus on the minimum amount of salary or the maximum amount of the worktime" with idiomatic alternatives ("laws should set and enforce minimum wages and limits on working hours").

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the original essay and repeatedly clarified which paragraph to revise and accepted the scaffolding from the assistant. Evidence: student pasted drafts and identified the paragraph beginning "According to the chart..."
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student followed a clear revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) and prioritized grammar when asked.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Proficient/Developing - The student attempted their own revisions and chose between model options, but did not extensively critique or reject AI recommendations; most evaluation was accept-or-adapt rather than deep analytic critique.
- **Independent Editing**: Developing - The student produced multiple drafts but relied on the assistant for final grammatical correction and for making the paragraph fully coherent; further independent polishing is recommended.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Strengthen evidence use: when referring to the chart, include specific numbers or describe the chart details briefly to back claims and show data literacy.
2. Deepen analytical moves: add one sentence that explains the policy mechanism (e.g., enforcement, inspection, legal status) that links weak rules to employer behavior.
3. Practice autonomous revision: attempt at least one round of self-editing before asking the AI for grammar fixes—highlight the changes you made so the AI can give targeted feedback on remaining issues.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student engaged productively with the AI and followed a structured revision plan, resulting in measurable improvements (+23 points). The targeted support (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph) was effective.
- For grading or next steps, encourage the student to add explicit references to the chart in the next revision and to work on polishing remaining phrasing issues. The student shows good potential for further improvement with focused practice in evidence use and idiomatic phrasing.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
To my opinion, the government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard the migrants right. According to the chart, most countries have more unemployed native-born population than the migrants, and that can be owe to the weak regulations. The unique identity makes the migrants suffering low income while doing long time, heavy works, which is unfair comparing to the native-born population who only needs to do a lighter work but get a higher income. The employers are more likely to recruit those migrants than native-born population because of their high cost-effect. Meanwhile, to make-ends-meet, the native-born population can’t make a live at their homeland because of the replacement of the migrants, they have no idea but go to other countries for job and become part of the migrants gradually. As a consequence, the country might lost its initial residences which will lead to the country itself unstable. To make things worse, the country even has a possibility to break down due to the lost of population, the government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights. At the same time, it is also crucial to ensure the laws shouldn’t be too strict to make the migrants afraid to come. The law should either protect the migrants or the native-born population from getting unequal treatment.

Revised:
Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrants’ rights because stronger regulation reduces exploitation, ensures fair pay and reasonable hours, and preserves social stability. Because employers can hire migrants at lower wages and demand longer hours where labor protections are weak, native-born workers often face higher unemployment. The chart shows that in many countries unemployment among native-born workers is higher than among migrants, which may be linked to weak regulations. Migrants—who may be recognizable by language, legal status, or other factors—frequently earn low incomes while doing long hours of hard work, which is unfair compared with native-born workers who sometimes do lighter work for higher pay. Employers are more likely to recruit migrants because they are more cost-effective. As a result, some native-born workers struggle to make a living and may leave the country to find work elsewhere, gradually joining the migrant workforce. This population change can destabilize communities and, in extreme cases, threaten social stability. To address these problems, the government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrants’ rights. The laws can focus on the minimum amount of salary or the maximum amount of the worktime for the migrant workers and just the opposite to the native-born workers. Given to the pre-existing regulations, enhance efforts to punish the employers once find them didn’t obey them can also be a superior way to achieve the purpose. At the same time, it is crucial that laws are balanced so they do not discourage necessary migration; the law should protect both migrants and native-born workers from unequal treatment.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:35:12.714Z

**You:** Give

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:36:17.389Z

**Assistant:** Hi — I’m glad to help you revise this essay. Before we begin, let’s agree what to focus on so our time is effective.

1) What’s your goal for this session?
- Do you most want help with clarity of ideas, strengthening the argument, improving organization (topic sentences and paragraph unity), or fixing grammar and word choice? You can pick up to two priorities.

2) Quick diagnostic feedback (short and clear), using the rubric categories:

- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: You clearly take a position (you support stricter laws).
  - Needs work: The thesis is unclear and unconfident (“To my opinion,” grammatical errors). It doesn’t preview the essay’s main points or structure.

- Organization
  - Strengths: The essay attempts multiple reasons and consequences.
  - Needs work: Paragraphs are repetitive and some sentences drift off-topic. Topic sentences are weak or missing logical links to the thesis.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: You refer to the chart and give cause-effect ideas.
  - Needs work: Claims are vague (e.g., “can be owe to the weak regulations”); the chart isn’t explained; examples and explanations need clearer logic and support.

- Language Use (grammar, word choice, sentence clarity)
  - Strengths: Overall message is understandable.
  - Needs work: Many grammar and vocabulary errors (articles, verb forms, plurals, word choice), awkward phrasing, and some run-on sentences that obscure meaning.

3) Which areas would you like to focus on in this session?
- Options to choose from (pick one or two): 
  1. Thesis clarity and previewing main points
  2. Topic sentence and paragraph focus (organization)
  3. Developing evidence and clearer explanations
  4. Grammar and word choice in one paragraph

Remember: we will only revise the thesis, one body paragraph’s topic sentence, and that paragraph’s supporting sentences. Tell me:
- Which of the options above you want to work on,
- Which body paragraph you want to revise (for example: “the paragraph that begins ‘According to the chart…’”), and
- Please confirm or paste your current thesis statement (you already have one; paste it if you want me to comment on it).

Once you confirm the targets and the paragraph, we’ll move to Step 1: revising the thesis. Would you like to choose now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:36:35.503Z

**You:** How can revise my thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:37:13.738Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m glad you want to work on the thesis. Quick check before I give feedback and examples: do you want to focus only on the thesis statement (recommended), or would you like to focus on thesis plus one other area (for example, grammar)? Reply with your choice (one or two targets), then I’ll continue.

Meanwhile, here’s specific feedback on your current thesis and a couple of model revisions you can choose from or use as a guide.

1) Feedback on your current thesis
- Current thesis: "To my opinion, the government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard the migrants right."
- What’s good: You clearly state that the government should act.
- What needs work:
  - Grammar and phrasing: “To my opinion” is incorrect; say “In my opinion” (but better: drop the phrase altogether and make a strong claim). “migrants right” needs the possessive: migrants' rights.
  - Lack of preview: It doesn’t say what stricter laws should do or which main reasons support your view.
  - Weak tone: avoid hedging phrases like “In my opinion” if you want a confident thesis.

2) What a strong thesis should do (quick checklist)
- Answer the question directly (yes/no and why).
- Preview the main reasons you will discuss (2–3 brief points).
- Use confident, clear language and correct grammar.

3) Two model thesis sentences you can use or adapt
- Option A (concise): Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrants' rights, because stronger regulation reduces exploitation, ensures fair pay and working hours, and helps maintain social stability.
- Option B (balanced, matching ideas in your essay): Governments must adopt stricter—but balanced—laws to protect migrants' rights by preventing exploitative hiring and pay practices, ensuring reasonable working hours, and protecting native workers' livelihoods; such laws should protect migrants without discouraging needed migration.

Would you like to:
- Try rewriting your thesis now using these suggestions (I’ll give feedback), or
- I can insert one of the model options into your essay so you can see how it reads in context?

If you want, I’ve inserted Option B into your essay below so you can see the full text with a revised thesis. (I changed only the thesis sentence — the rest of your draft is unchanged so you can see how the new thesis links to your existing paragraphs.)

Full essay with revised thesis (Option B inserted):
---
Governments must adopt stricter—but balanced—laws to protect migrants' rights by preventing exploitative hiring and pay practices, ensuring reasonable working hours, and protecting native workers' livelihoods; such laws should protect migrants without discouraging needed migration. According to the chart, most countries have more unemployed native-born population than the migrants, and that can be owe to the weak regulations. The unique identity makes the migrants suffering low income while doing long time, heavy works, which is unfair comparing to the native-born population who only needs to do a lighter work but get a higher income. The employers are more likely to recruit those migrants than native-born population because of their high cost-effect. Meanwhile, to make-ends-meet, the native-born population can’t make a live at their homeland because of the replacement of the migrants, they have no idea but go to other countries for job and become part of the migrants gradually. As a consequence, the country might lost its initial residences which will lead to the country itself unstable. To make things worse, the country even has a possibility to break down due to the lost of population, the government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights. At the same time, it is also crucial to ensure the laws shouldn’t be too strict to make the migrants afraid to come. The law should either protect the migrants or the native-born population from getting unequal treatment.

Next step:
- Do you want to keep this revised thesis (Option B), pick Option A, or try writing your own version now? If you write one, paste it and I’ll give focused feedback. Once you’re happy with the thesis, we’ll move to Step 2 (choose a paragraph and revise its topic sentence).

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:37:40.746Z

**You:** According to the chart, it's easy to conclude that most countries have more unemployed native-born population than the migrants, and that can be owe to the weak regulations. So as far as I was concerned, the government do needs to enforce stricter laws to safeguard the migrant' rights, because stronger regulation reduces exploitation, ensures fair pay and working hours, and helps maintain social stability.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:48:10.663Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a good place to continue. Quick checklist before we start Step 1.

1) Goals — pick up to two (reply with your choices)
- Clarity of ideas
- Strengthening the argument
- Organization / topic sentences and paragraph focus
- Developing evidence and explanations
- Grammar and word choice

Which one or two do you want to work on right now?

2) Short updated diagnosis (based on your latest draft and that new attempted thesis)
- Thesis & Argument: You state a position, but the thesis is wordy, has grammar issues, and still hedges (“it’s easy to conclude,” “as far as I was concerned”). It doesn’t cleanly preview 2–3 main reasons.
- Organization: The essay tries to give causes and consequences, but ideas repeat and some sentences drift from the main claim.
- Evidence & Development: You mention the chart, but you don’t explain what it shows or connect it clearly to your claims.
- Language Use: Several grammar and word-choice problems (articles, verb forms, plurals, phrases like “make a live,” “can be owe to,” “high cost-effect”).

3) Choose revision targets and the paragraph
- Which of the options above do you want to focus on? (Pick one or two.)
- Which body paragraph shall we revise? (You wrote: “According to the chart, most countries…” — do you want to revise that paragraph? If yes, I’ll work on its topic sentence and then the rest of that paragraph.)
- Confirm the current thesis you want me to comment on (you pasted this). I’ll treat this as your current thesis to revise:
"According to the chart, it's easy to conclude that most countries have more unemployed native-born population than the migrants, and that can be owe to the weak regulations. So as far as I was concerned, the government do needs to enforce stricter laws to safeguard the migrant' rights, because stronger regulation reduces exploitation, ensures fair pay and working hours, and helps maintain social stability."

Once you confirm targets and the paragraph, we’ll move to Step 1 (thesis revision).

If you want a quick preview: I recommend focusing on (1) a clearer, confident thesis that previews 2–3 reasons, and (2) the paragraph that begins “According to the chart…” — that will make the rest of the essay easier to fix. Would you like to proceed with those two targets?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:48:29.502Z

**You:** Revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:50:44.482Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. Quick check before I revise: do you want to focus only on the thesis statement for this step, or do you want the thesis plus one other target (for example, grammar)? Reply with “thesis only” or “thesis + [other target].”

Meanwhile, you’ve already given a version of your thesis. I’ll use this as the current draft to comment on:
"According to the chart, it's easy to conclude that most countries have more unemployed native-born population than the migrants, and that can be owe to the weak regulations. So as far as I was concerned, the government do needs to enforce stricter laws to safeguard the migrant' rights, because stronger regulation reduces exploitation, ensures fair pay and working hours, and helps maintain social stability."

Feedback (brief and specific)
- Strengths: You answer the question (you support stricter laws) and you try to preview reasons (reduce exploitation, fair pay/hours, social stability).
- Problems to fix:
  - Wordiness and mixed ideas — combine into one clear sentence.
  - Grammar and phrasing errors (e.g., “can be owe to,” “do needs,” “migrant'”).
  - Tone — avoid hedging phrases like “As far as I was concerned” or “According to the chart” at the start of the thesis.
  - Preview — make the reasons concise and parallel.

Two clear, model thesis options you can choose or adapt
- Option 1 (concise, direct): Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrants' rights because stronger regulation reduces exploitation, ensures fair pay and reasonable hours, and preserves social stability.
- Option 2 (balanced, echoes your caution about not deterring migrants): Governments should adopt stricter—but balanced—laws to protect migrants' rights by preventing exploitation, guaranteeing fair pay and working hours, and protecting native workers’ livelihoods without discouraging needed migration.

Would you like to:
- Pick one of these options as your new thesis (I’ll then insert it into your essay and we’ll move to Step 2), or
- Try rewriting your own thesis now (paste it and I’ll give targeted feedback)?

If you pick a model, say “Use Option 1” or “Use Option 2.” If you want to write one, paste it and I’ll respond with quick feedback.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:51:02.667Z

**You:** Use option1

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:53:16.927Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. I’ve inserted Option 1 as your thesis. Here is your full essay with that thesis placed at the start (I changed only the thesis sentence so you can see how it fits):

---
Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrants' rights because stronger regulation reduces exploitation, ensures fair pay and reasonable hours, and preserves social stability. According to the chart, most countries have more unemployed native-born population than the migrants, and that can be owe to the weak regulations. The unique identity makes the migrants suffering low income while doing long time, heavy works, which is unfair comparing to the native-born population who only needs to do a lighter work but get a higher income. The employers are more likely to recruit those migrants than native-born population because of their high cost-effect. Meanwhile, to make-ends-meet, the native-born population can’t make a live at their homeland because of the replacement of the migrants, they have no idea but go to other countries for job and become part of the migrants gradually. As a consequence, the country might lost its initial residences which will lead to the country itself unstable. To make things worse, the country even has a possibility to break down due to the lost of population, the government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights. At the same time, it is also crucial to ensure the laws shouldn’t be too strict to make the migrants afraid to come. The law should either protect the migrants or the native-born population from getting unequal treatment.

Quick check before we move on:
- Are you satisfied with this thesis sentence as written? If not, tell me what you want changed (tone, length, or focus).
- If you are happy with it, we’ll move to Step 2.

Step 2 — choose a paragraph to work on
- Which paragraph would you like to revise next? I recommend the paragraph that begins “According to the chart...,” because it’s your first reason and needs a clearer topic sentence and stronger links to the thesis. Do you want to work on that one?

Also tell me which one or two revision targets you want to focus on now (pick up to two):
- Topic sentence and paragraph focus (organization)
- Developing evidence and clearer explanations
- Grammar and word choice in that paragraph

Once you confirm:
- Paste or confirm the current topic sentence you want to revise (if it’s the “According to the chart…” sentence, just confirm), and
- Would you like to try revising that topic sentence now? I’ll give feedback and then help you revise the rest of the paragraph.

Short and simple: confirm the thesis is OK, pick the paragraph (“According to the chart…”?), and choose your one or two targets. Would you like to proceed?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:53:39.729Z

**You:** Revise topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:55:11.005Z

**Assistant:** Nice — thanks for saying you want to revise topic sentences. Quick check before we start:

1) Do you accept this thesis as the final one for today?
Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrants' rights because stronger regulation reduces exploitation, ensures fair pay and reasonable hours, and preserves social stability.
Reply “Yes” to keep it, or “No — I want to change it” and say what you’d like adjusted.

2) Confirm targets (pick one or two):
- Topic sentence and paragraph focus (organization)
- Developing evidence and explanations
- Grammar and word choice in that paragraph
You said “Revise topic sentences” — do you also want grammar/word-choice help in the same paragraph?

3) Confirm paragraph to work on:
- I’ll assume you mean the paragraph that begins “According to the chart….” Confirm “Yes” or tell me a different paragraph.

Once you confirm 1–3, we’ll do Step 2. Meanwhile, a quick, useful diagnosis of the current topic sentence and how to improve it:

- Current opening: “According to the chart, most countries have more unemployed native-born population than the migrants, and that can be owe to the weak regulations.”
- Why this is weak as a topic sentence:
  - It mostly reports data rather than making a clear claim that links to your thesis.
  - It’s wordy and has grammar problems (“can be owe to,” articles/number agreement).
  - It doesn’t preview what this paragraph will argue about exploitation, pay, or hours.

How a strong topic sentence should work here:
- Make a clear claim that connects directly to the thesis (e.g., weak regulations allow employers to exploit migrants).
- Be specific enough to guide the paragraph (so the rest of the paragraph can give evidence and explanation).
- Use confident, grammatical language.

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now? Try writing one sentence that:
- States a clear claim about how weak regulations lead to migrant exploitation (and links to the thesis),
- Is short and direct.

If you’d like examples to adapt, here are two model topic-sentence options you can use or change (pick one or rewrite your own — try first!):

- Option A (focus on exploitation): Weak or missing labor regulations allow employers to exploit migrants, paying them less and requiring longer hours than native workers.
- Option B (links migrants’ treatment to native workers): In countries with weak labor laws, employers often prefer hiring migrants because they can pay lower wages and demand longer hours, which harms both migrants and native workers.

Try writing your own version now (one sentence). I’ll give quick feedback and then we’ll revise the rest of that paragraph. Would you like to try it?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:55:30.345Z

**You:** Yes

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:55:58.462Z

**Assistant:** Excellent — thanks for confirming the thesis. Let’s focus on the topic sentence next.

Please try writing one revised topic sentence for the paragraph that begins “According to the chart….” Paste your single-sentence attempt here when you’re ready.

A few quick reminders to help you:
- Link the sentence to the thesis: show how weak regulations cause exploitation or unfair pay/hours.
- Make a clear claim (don’t just report the chart’s data).
- Be short, direct, and use an active verb. Avoid starting with “According to the chart” in the topic sentence itself.

If you’d like a quick starter, you could begin with:
- “Weak labor regulations …” or
- “In countries with weak labor laws …”

Go ahead and try one sentence now — I’ll give focused feedback and then we’ll revise the rest of the paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T13:56:15.171Z

**You:** In countries with weak labor laws, most countries have more unemployed native-born population than the migrants, which can be several times as the latter, and that can be owe to the weak regulations.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T14:02:02.411Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this shows you’re trying to connect the chart to the cause (weak laws). Good first step.

Quick, specific feedback on your sentence
- Redundant/awkward phrasing: “In countries with weak labor laws, most countries …” repeats “countries.”  
- Unclear comparison: “more unemployed native-born population than the migrants” is confusing — it’s better to say “higher unemployment among native-born workers than among migrants” if that’s what the chart shows.  
- Grammar and word choice: “which can be several times as the latter” is unclear; use “may be several times higher” if you mean magnitude. “can be owe to” should be “may be due to” or “can be attributed to.”  
- Topic-sentence function: right now it mostly reports data. A strong topic sentence should make a clear claim that links to your thesis (how weak laws lead to exploitation or displacement), then the paragraph can use the chart to support that claim.

Three short model topic-sentence options you can adapt
- Option A (focus on exploitation): Weak labor laws enable employers to exploit migrants by paying lower wages and demanding longer hours.  
- Option B (connects exploitation to native unemployment): Because employers can pay migrants less and require longer hours where labor protections are weak, native-born workers often face higher unemployment.  
- Option C (balanced claim that guides the paragraph): In countries with weak labor regulations, the ability to underpay and overwork migrants contributes to both migrant exploitation and rising unemployment among native workers.

Quick checklist for a strong topic sentence
- Make a clear claim (cause → effect).  
- Link it to your thesis (exploitation, pay, hours, social stability).  
- Keep it short and grammatical.  
- Save the chart details or numbers for the sentences that follow.

Paste your next attempt and I’ll give focused feedback.

**You:** In countries with weak labor laws, most of them have higher unemployment among native-born workers than among migrants, which can be several times as the latter, and that may be due to the weak regulations that cause the exploitation.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T14:06:59.716Z

**Assistant:** Good attempt — you’re making the connection between weak laws, migrant exploitation, and native unemployment. That’s exactly the right idea. Now let’s make the sentence clearer and stronger.

Quick, specific feedback on your version
- Redundant: “In countries with weak labor laws, most of them…” repeats “countries.”  
- Unclear comparison: “which can be several times as the latter” is confusing — say “may be several times higher” if you mean magnitude.  
- Wordy and unfocused: the sentence tries to do three things at once (report the chart, compare unemployment, claim cause). A topic sentence should make one clear claim that links to the thesis.  
- Grammar: awkward phrasing (“that may be due to the weak regulations that cause the exploitation”). Use active verbs and simpler structure.

Pick one clear purpose for the topic sentence (then you can use the chart details in the next sentences). Here are three short model options you can pick or adapt:

- Option A (focus on exploitation): Weak labor laws enable employers to exploit migrants by paying lower wages and requiring longer hours.  
- Option B (connects exploitation to native unemployment): Because employers can hire migrants at lower wages and longer hours where labor protections are weak, native-born workers often face higher unemployment.  
- Option C (links the chart idea + claim): The chart’s data reflect how weak labor regulations allow employers to underpay and overwork migrants, which can also increase unemployment among native workers.

Would you like to:
- Pick one of these options to use as your topic sentence, or
- Try another revision yourself now?

If you want grammar/word-choice help for this sentence, say “Yes — please edit this sentence,” and paste your next attempt. Would you like to try revising it now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T14:07:11.971Z

**You:** Option B

*Time:* 2025-11-26T14:11:47.082Z

**Assistant:** Good choice — Option B is a strong topic sentence and it links well to your thesis.

Here’s the sentence you picked (so we’re clear):
"Because employers can hire migrants at lower wages and longer hours where labor protections are weak, native-born workers often face higher unemployment."

Quick feedback (very brief)
- Strengths: Clear cause-effect link; ties to the thesis (weak laws → exploitation → harm to natives); focused and active.
- One small tweak to consider: move the clause about weak protections to the start for clarity (optional). But if you like this version, it works well as your topic sentence.

Step 3 — Revising the rest of that paragraph
We’ll now revise the supporting sentences so they clearly develop this topic sentence. I won’t rewrite your paragraph for you; instead I’ll give focused guidance and ask you to try edits. Then I’ll give feedback and corrections.

Follow this plan (three short steps) and then paste your attempt:
1) Clarify the chart claim (1–2 sentences)
   - Goal: Explain what the chart shows in one clear sentence (avoid repeating “countries” twice).
   - Hint: Use a simple structure: “The chart shows that …” or “In many countries, the chart shows …”
   - Avoid vague phrasing like “can be owe to”; use “may be due to” or “is linked to.”

2) Explain the causal link (1–2 sentences)
   - Goal: Show how weak protections let employers pay migrants less and require longer hours.
   - Prompt questions to answer in 1–2 sentences:
     - How do weak laws let employers take advantage of migrants?
     - Why would employers prefer migrants over native workers?

3) Connect to consequences (1–2 sentences)
   - Goal: Explain how this hiring practice raises unemployment or harms native workers, and tie back to social stability (your thesis).
   - Keep one sentence for the direct consequence and one for the broader social impact or transition to the next paragraph.

A few useful words/phrases you can use (pick 1–2):
- “The chart shows…”
- “may be due to…”
- “employers often…”
- “as a result…”
- “this can lead to…”
- “consequently…”

Would you like:
- Grammar/word-choice help as you revise each sentence? (Yes/No)
- Or do you want to try rewriting the paragraph now and paste it for feedback?

Your next step: paste your revised paragraph (or the first one or two sentences) and I’ll give specific, encouraging feedback and guide any further fixes. Would you like to start with the chart sentence now?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T14:12:07.205Z

**You:** Revise the grammar

*Time:* 2025-11-26T14:13:25.795Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I’ll revise the grammar. Quick confirmation before I made changes: I treated your priority as “Grammar and word choice” for the paragraph that begins “According to the chart…,” and I used the clearer thesis we discussed earlier:

Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrants' rights because stronger regulation reduces exploitation, ensures fair pay and reasonable hours, and preserves social stability.

I corrected grammar, wording, and sentence flow in that paragraph only (I did not change the other paragraphs except replacing the original thesis). If you want a different thesis or a different paragraph, tell me and I’ll revise again.

Here is the full essay with the corrected thesis and the revised paragraph:

---
Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrants' rights because stronger regulation reduces exploitation, ensures fair pay and reasonable hours, and preserves social stability. Because employers can hire migrants at lower wages and demand longer hours where labor protections are weak, native-born workers often face higher unemployment. The chart shows that in many countries unemployment among native-born workers is higher than among migrants, which may be linked to weak regulations. Migrants—who may be recognizable by language, legal status, or other factors—frequently earn low incomes while doing long hours of hard work, which is unfair compared with native-born workers who sometimes do lighter work for higher pay. Employers are more likely to recruit migrants because they are more cost-effective. As a result, some native-born workers struggle to make a living and may leave the country to find work elsewhere, gradually joining the migrant workforce. This population change can destabilize communities and, in extreme cases, threaten social stability. To address these problems, the government should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrants' rights. At the same time, it is crucial that laws are balanced so they do not discourage necessary migration; the law should protect both migrants and native-born workers from unequal treatment.
---

Brief note on the main grammar fixes I made:
- Fixed articles, plural/singular agreement, and possessives (e.g., migrants' rights).
- Replaced incorrect or awkward phrases (e.g., “can be owe to” → “may be linked to,” “make a live” → “make a living”).
- Split and reordered run-on sentences for clarity and correct punctuation.
- Improved word choice for clarity (e.g., “high cost-effect” → “more cost-effective”).
- Kept your original ideas and logical flow while making the language standard and readable.

Would you like to:
- Review this paragraph together and try one or two edits yourself (I’ll guide you), or
- Have me also correct grammar in another paragraph now?

If you want line-by-line explanations for any sentence I changed, tell me which sentence and I’ll walk you through the edits.
