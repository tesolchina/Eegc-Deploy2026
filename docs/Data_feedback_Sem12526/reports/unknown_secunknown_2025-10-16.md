## 📈 Your Contribution Analysis

Here is a polished revision of the essay section incorporating the concept “Individual = a citizen” with the voting example you chose:

---

Another important point is that individuals are citizens, and as citizens, they have the power to influence government decisions. When many people change their lifestyles, such as choosing to walk instead of drive, governments notice these shifts. Politicians want votes, so they create policies that appeal to citizens’ concerns. For instance, when many citizens vote for leaders who prioritize environmental protection, governments are more likely to pass green laws or stronger climate policies. Therefore, individual actions can push governments to do more. This collective influence might even start a large movement for change, although it is hard to say exactly how many people need to participate for it to be effective.

Original:
Climate change, it is very huge problem now. I think individual actions not so important like what government and big companies do. But still, I kinda disagree because people also can do stuff to help. I will explain my thoughts here.

First, governments and companies, they got more power. They can do big things. Like, government make laws for no pollution. They can stop plastic bags or tell factories to not make so much smoke. Companies also can change their ways. They can use less energy or make stuff that don't hurt environment. This is good because it change many people life at once. So powerful, you know.

But individual actions, they matter too, I guess. If many people do little things, it add up. Like, turn off lights at home save energy. Or buy things from green companies. Then companies think, oh, we must be green to sell more. But sometimes it hard to know if this really work. People don't always do it. Also, one person doing something. It not enough.

Another thing. When people change their life, like stop using car and walk, government see this. Politicians want votes, so they make rules people like. So individual action can push government to do more. Maybe start big movement. But I not sure how many people need to do this for it to work. Just thinking.

Some say individual action too small. One person cannot fix climate change. True, but if million people try, maybe it help. Every small thing count. Or not? I don't know sometimes.

Anyway, I think both individual and government and companies must work. Individual action seem small but if many do it, it big. We need all to fix this problem. Climate change very bad, so everyone must try hard. That's my opinion.

Revised:
Climate change is a very huge problem now. I think individual actions are not as important as what governments and big companies do. But still, I kinda disagree because people also can do things to help. I will explain my thoughts here.

First, governments and companies have more power. They can do big things. For example, governments can make laws to stop pollution. They can ban plastic bags or tell factories not to make so much smoke. Companies can also change their ways by using less energy or making products that do not hurt the environment. These actions are good because they change many people's lives at once. So powerful, you know.

But individual actions matter too, I guess. If many people do little things, it adds up. Like, turning off lights at home saves energy. Or buying things from green companies. Then companies think, oh, we must be green to sell more. But sometimes it is hard to know if this really works because people do not always do it. Also, one person doing something is not enough.

Another thing is that individuals are citizens, and as citizens they can influence the government. When people change their lives, like stop using cars and walk more, the government sees this. Politicians want votes, so they make rules people like. For instance, when many citizens vote for leaders who care about the environment, governments are more likely to pass green laws or stronger climate policies. So, individual action can push the government to do more. Maybe it can start a big movement, but I am not sure how many people need to do it for it to work. Just thinking.

Some say individual action is too small. One person cannot fix climate change. True, but if a million people try, maybe it helps. Every small thing counts. Or not? I do not know sometimes.

Anyway, I think both individuals (as citizens), governments, and companies must work together. Individual action seems small, but if many do it, it becomes big. We need everyone to fix this problem. Climate change is very bad, so everyone must try hard. That's my opinion.

### 👤 **You** (下午12:20:40)

Revise this essay ,adding the concept 'Individual= a citizen( a concept related to the government, citizens can vote, pressure the government)' into the esaay

### 🤖 **Assistant** (下午12:20:44)

Thanks for sharing the draft! Before we dig in:

- Can you confirm: Is this for LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship?
- Are you assessed on BOTH essay revision AND how you communicate with AI?
- What are your main concerns about this essay?
- Do you know the rubrics for both essay and AI collaboration skills?

Let me know this context so we can plan revision strategically and target your assessment needs.

### 👤 **You** (下午12:22:30)

Yes, it is for lang0036.


### 🤖 **Assistant** (下午12:22:56)

Great, thanks for confirming the course!

- Are you clear that you're assessed on BOTH essay improvement AND AI collaboration skills (like critical review and in-depth conversation)?
- Can you share your top concerns about the essay? (e.g., ideas, logic, grammar, etc.)
- Do you know the main points on the rubrics? (Essay: Content, Organisation, Vocabulary, Grammar. AI: Conversation, Review, Refinement)

Let me know so we can decide where to start revising!

### 👤 **You** (下午12:26:30)

Yes, my top concerns is the idea of the essay. Yes I know 

### 🤖 **Assistant** (下午12:27:04)

Great! You're showing **Skill 1: Provide Context** – nice start.

Since your main concern is the ideas, let's diagnose the essay's **macro** issues first (Content & Organisation). 

- Where do you feel your argument is weakest? Is it clarity, evidence, or structure?
- For "Content & Ideas" rubric: is your viewpoint and reasoning clear?
- For "Organisation": does each paragraph have a clear purpose and flow?
  
Which area should we focus on first—clarifying your main argument, adding evidence, or fixing structure?

### 👤 **You** (下午12:30:34)

The clarity is not enough, I want to add the concept of Individual= a citizen( a concept related to the government, citizens can vote, pressure the government)


### 🤖 **Assistant** (下午12:30:38)

Great! This shows **Skill 2: Strategic Planning**—you’ve prioritized clarity and deeper connection between citizens (individuals) and government action.

Suggestions:
- In the “individual action” paragraph, clarify that individuals are citizens who influence government decisions through voting and advocacy.
- Consider giving a specific example (e.g., voting for green policies or joining environmental campaigns).
- This directly improves "Content & Ideas" and "Organisation".

What do you think? How might adding this concept help your argument?

### 👤 **You** (下午12:32:06)

Good

### 🤖 **Assistant** (下午12:32:20)

You’re building your **Critical Review** skills by reflecting on these suggestions!

- Why do you think clarifying how individual actions influence government might help your essay match the “Content & Ideas” rubric?
- Do you think adding a concrete example (like voting or petitioning) will make your reasoning stronger or clearer? Why or why not?
- Would you rather add an example about voting, about green shopping, or about protests/campaigns?

Let me know what you prefer—then, try drafting one or two sentences to strengthen that part of your essay.

### 👤 **You** (下午12:35:21)

Yes I think adding a concrete example will make my reasoning stronger. I would rather add an example about voting

### 🤖 **Assistant** (下午12:35:25)

Excellent! You're actively **choosing your example** and justifying your choice—strong Critical Review and Strategic Planning.

Here’s what to consider changing:
- In the paragraph about individual action influencing government, add a sentence showing how citizens vote for politicians with strong climate policies.
- Example: “For instance, when many people vote for leaders who care about the environment, governments are more likely to pass green laws.”

Now you try: draft a revised version of that section including the voting example.
