            ## Contribution Analysis

            It looks like you’ve made a start on revising the thesis by sharing a supporting idea, but the thesis statement itself still needs to be clearer, more confident, and include both main points explicitly.

To help you move forward and complete the revision steps, here are some suggestions:

1. **Revise Your Thesis Statement:**  
Try crafting a single, confident sentence that clearly states your overall position and previews your two main arguments. For example:  
_“While government actions are crucial to addressing climate change, individual citizens also play an important role by influencing policy decisions and adopting sustainable lifestyle choices.”_

2. **Revise Topic Sentences for Body Paragraphs:**  
Once your thesis is strong, write clear topic sentences to focus each paragraph:  
- Paragraph 1: How citizens influence government policies to fight climate change.  
- Paragraph 2: How individual green lifestyle choices contribute to environmental change.

3. **Revise Body Paragraphs:**  
Improve clarity, fix grammar mistakes, and deepen explanations/examples. For instance, correct sentences like “so is not always working well” to “so it does not always work well,” and elaborate on how individuals’ actions encourage businesses to be sustainable.

4. **Engage with AI Feedback:**  
After revising each part, share your new draft here with explanations of what you changed and why, so we can continue refining together.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The essay demonstrates generally clear ideas with a balanced viewpoint on government versus individual responsibility in climate change. Both sides of the argument are presented, but some ideas lack nuanced development and depth.
- Organization: 19/25 - The essay has an overall clear structure, with progression from government influence to individual actions and a conclusion. However, there are some awkward transitions and logical connections that could be stronger.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary is mostly adequate and topic-specific, but some phrasing is repetitive (“green lifestyle choices,” “not really enough”) and lacks variety. Precision could be improved.
- Grammar: 17/25 - Sentence structure is generally understandable. Minor errors (“so is not always working well,” “so nothing happen,” “so it not really enough...”) detract from clarity and academic tone.
- **Original Essay Total: 74/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - No substantial changes or improvements in content; the main arguments and examples remain the same with only very minor word alterations.
- Organization: 19/25 - Paragraph and essay structure unchanged. No noticeable revisions in logical progression or paragraph focus.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary use is nearly identical to original. No new word choices or enhancements.
- Grammar: 17/25 - Grammatical issues from the original remain almost untouched.
- **Revised Essay Total: 74/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - [No clear improvements; revised essay is nearly the same as original except for one minor change in thesis wording]
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Clear revision of thesis statement to preview two arguments (as suggested by AI)
  - Revision of topic sentences for focus and clarity
  - Revision of body paragraphs to improve depth, grammar, and flow

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 5**
- **Conversation Quality:** The exchanges focus primarily on revising the thesis statement, but student interaction is limited and does not follow through on suggestions. The AI provides supportive, specific feedback, but student responses are minimal and do not engage in any revision cycle for topic sentences or body paragraphs.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 - Basic conversation; exchanges are limited to identifying and attempting (unsuccessfully) to revise the thesis. No multi-layered questioning, little depth.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - Student acknowledges the feedback but does not critically evaluate or elaborate on AI suggestions; no acceptance, rejection, or alternative proposals provided.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 - No revision cycle is completed. Student does not revise any topic sentences or body paragraphs as instructed, and does not iterate on the thesis revision after feedback.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 5/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Student is able to locate and share the thesis statement as requested (evidence: first user reply).
- Willingness to participate in AI-assisted revision process (initial engagement in chat).
- AI provides clear, detailed formative feedback and suggestions for improvement.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Student must complete all required revision steps (thesis, topic sentence, body paragraph) before module can be considered finished.
- Deeper critical engagement with AI feedback is necessary—respond with specific revisions and explanations.
- Expand collaboration beyond surface-level exchanges; further analyze and iterate on writing based on feedback.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement – Student provides basic context (identifies thesis) but does not discuss goals, essay requirements, or rationale.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement – Student does not demonstrate a revision plan or prioritize tasks.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement – No evidence of analysis, justification, or critical engagement with AI suggestions.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement – No meaningful independent editing is shown.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing Skills**: Actively apply AI feedback by revising and strengthening thesis statements, topic sentences, and body paragraphs. Address both content and language accuracy.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills**: Respond with both revisions and rationales. Engage more deeply—ask clarifying questions and build on suggestions to improve quality.
3. **Overall Improvement**: Complete all required revision tasks, then repeat the process to develop more sophisticated writing and revision strategies.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
Student has not completed the required revision steps (thesis statement, topic sentence, body paragraph). Significant independent editing and iterative engagement with feedback is necessary for training completion. Please encourage the student to return to revision steps and use AI collaboratively to improve all aspects of the essay.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:14:50.819Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:19:06.286Z

**Assistant:** Great, thank you for sharing your thesis statement:

**"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."**

Let's go through step 1 together!

**Feedback on Your Thesis Statement:**

- **Clarity:** Your thesis is clear in presenting your position—that you partially agree, and you value both government influence and personal lifestyle choices.
- **Strength:** The language is a little uncertain ("I partly agree," "I also think," "still have a role to play"), which weakens the confidence.
- **Focus:** The sentence is a bit long and could be more direct. Also, it would be helpful to preview your main arguments more explicitly.

**Suggestions:**
- Use confident, academic language (avoid "I think," "I partly agree," "I also think").
- Clearly summarize the two main points you’ll discuss (citizen influence on government AND individual green choices).
- Make sure your thesis directly answers the essay question (whether individual actions matter).

**Prompt:**
Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now? Aim to:
- Use confident language.
- Mention both main arguments, clearly linking them to the essay focus.
- Directly answer the issue: To what extent do individual actions matter in climate change?

Let me know your revised version! I can offer suggestions if you'd like.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:19:29.119Z

**You:** When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:28:05.694Z

**Assistant:** Good work giving this a try!

Let’s look at your revised thesis:

**“When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy.”**

This is actually a supporting idea for your first body paragraph, not a thesis statement for the whole essay. Your thesis should:

- Be just one clear, strong sentence—usually at the end of your introduction.
- State your overall position (how much do individual actions matter?).
- Preview both main arguments: 1) citizens influencing governments, and 2) personal lifestyle habits.

**Let’s try again:**
Would you like to write a new thesis, using these guidelines?  
Try starting with something like:

“Although individual actions may seem less significant than those of governments and companies, they are important because citizens can influence government decisions and personal lifestyle choices contribute to broader cultural change.”

Want to try your own version now? Let me know when you’re ready or if you’d like more hints!
