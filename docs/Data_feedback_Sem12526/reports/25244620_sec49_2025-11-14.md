            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing the chat history and your training assessment report.

Based on your engagement so far, you have effectively followed the revision process steps and requested examples to guide your writing. However, you have not yet submitted your own revised thesis statement, revised topic sentences, or revised paragraph sentences for instructor or AI feedback. To complete this training successfully and deepen your writing skills, it is important to actively apply the examples and guidance to draft your own revisions and seek feedback on them.

Here are some tailored recommendations and next steps to help you progress:

---

### Next Steps for You:

1. **Revise Your Thesis Statement**  
 - Using the examples provided, please write and post your own revised thesis statement.  
 - Focus on making it a single, clear sentence that:  
  • Takes a confident position,  
  • Previews the two main points (citizens influencing government and personal eco-friendly actions), and  
  • Is formal and clear.

2. **Revise Your Topic Sentence**  
 - Choose one of the topic sentences you previously submitted (e.g., “The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”)  
 - Rewrite it to reflect your improved thesis and demonstrate academic tone and clarity.  
 - Post it here for feedback.

3. **Revise One or Two Supporting Sentences** from your body paragraph(s)  
 - For example, choose the sentence about how consumer purchasing affects business sustainability (you have several model sentences now).  
 - Write your own revision applying formal language and clearer explanations.  
 - Post it so you can get detailed advice.

4. **Engage Critically with AI Feedback**  
 - When you receive examples or suggestions, try to comment on what you like or want to change about them.  
 - Explain your choices or ask questions to deepen your understanding.

5. **Iterate Your Writing**  
 - Revise your drafts after feedback.  
 - The more drafts and reflections you produce, the more your revision skills will grow.

### Why These Steps Matter

- The goal is not just to understand *what* good sentences look like, but to practice *creating* them yourself.  
- Active revision helps internalize academic writing skills, and interaction with AI feedback builds your critical thinking and editing abilities.  
- Producing your own versions shows instructors your learning and helps identify specific strengths and weaknesses.

---

### Encouragement

You’ve demonstrated good process skills—following steps, asking for examples, and selecting relevant content. Now, take the next leap by transforming that knowledge into action. Even small drafts or partial revisions show progress. You can always improve them step by step.

---

If you like, please start by posting your own revised thesis statement now, and I’ll help you polish it. Then we can proceed to the topic sentence and paragraph sentences.

I’m here to support your writing development. Let me know when you’re ready!

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I strongly agree with this idea because I believe that government and corporate actions are crucial for addressing climate change but individual citizens can make a meaningful impact both by influencing policy and by adopting environmentally friendly habitsbut at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

Influencing government decisions remains a key method by which individuals contribute to solving the climate crisis. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, when a large number of consumers choose to purchase eco-friendly products, companies may adopt more sustainable production methods to meet this demand and remain competitive. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

**Assistant:** Great! Let's begin Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision.

**Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision**

1. Could you please share your current thesis statement from your essay?  
(Just copy the thesis sentence/section here!)

Once you share it, I’ll comment on its clarity, strength, and focus, and we’ll work together to revise it for clear academic writing.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T07:56:32.723Z

**You:** . I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government,

*Time:* 2025-11-14T07:57:05.880Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your current thesis statement:

> "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government,"

Here are some comments and suggestions for improvement:

**Clarity:** Your thesis gives your main opinion (partly agree) and mentions the influence of citizens on the government, but it does not clearly preview *all* the main points you discuss. It also feels unfinished, as the next idea (“personal green lifestyle choices…”) is missing.

**Strength:** The thesis uses “I partly agree”—this is fine, but try to use confident, academic language instead of “I think” or “I partly agree,” and avoid unclear phrasing.

**Focus:** To be more focused, your thesis should answer the essay question directly, specify the two main arguments (citizens influencing government, and individual green choices), and be one complete, clear sentence.

**Encouragement:** You’re almost there! All you need is a bit more precision and summary of your arguments.

---

**Guiding prompt:**
Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now to make it a single, clear sentence that answers the essay question, previews your main points, and uses confident language?

For example, you might mention both:  
1) the power of citizens to influence governments, and  
2) the impact of individual green choices—even if less significant.

Go ahead and try your revision! I’ll give feedback and help you polish it.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T07:57:11.128Z

**You:** Can you give me some example

*Time:* 2025-11-14T07:58:55.652Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! I’m happy to give you some example thesis statements—with the goal of helping you write your own strong version. Remember, I won’t write your thesis for you, but I can show you what a confident, focused thesis could look like:

**Example thesis statements (for guidance):**
- “Although government and corporate actions are crucial for addressing climate change, individual citizens can make a meaningful impact both by influencing policy and by adopting environmentally friendly habits.”
- “While large-scale policies have the greatest effect on climate change, individuals play a vital role by pressuring governments to act and by making sustainable choices in their daily lives.”
- “The fight against climate change relies primarily on collective government action, but individual influence over policy and personal eco-friendly behaviors remain important contributors.”

**Prompt for your revision:**  
Using these as examples, can you now try writing your own revised thesis statement, making sure it:
- Clearly answers the essay question,
- Previews your two main ideas, and
- Uses confident academic language?

Post your new version here and let’s review it together!

*Time:* 2025-11-14T07:59:00.103Z

**You:** Move to the next step

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:02:14.400Z

**Assistant:** Perfect, let’s move to **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**.

First, please choose **one body paragraph** from your essay that you’d like to focus on.  
You can pick either:

- The paragraph about influencing government and politicians, **OR**
- The paragraph about personal green lifestyle choices.

**Which one would you like to work on?**  
Once you tell me, please copy the topic sentence from that paragraph here. (Just the first sentence of that paragraph!)

Then I’ll review the topic sentence and give you feedback and hints to help you revise it so it clearly connects to your updated thesis statement.

Let me know which paragraph you choose and post its topic sentence!

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:02:16.899Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:03:19.579Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your choice and your topic sentence:

> "The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians."

**Comments on your topic sentence:**

- **Strength:** This sentence is clear and states a main idea, which is good!
- **Connection to Thesis:** Your thesis highlights both the importance of large-scale policy *and* individual influence. The topic sentence should directly connect to your thesis’s mention of influencing government.
- **Precision:** The phrase “the most important way” is a strong claim—make sure it matches what your thesis says (your thesis may suggest it’s one key way among others, not necessarily the “most important”). Try not to overstate.
- **Academic tone:** Try rephrasing for a more academic, precise style.

**Guiding questions and prompts:**

1. Does your topic sentence clearly show *how* individuals can make an impact on climate change?  
2. Does it echo the confident, precise style used in your thesis?

**Hints for improvement:**  
- You might want to use words like “One significant way…” or “Individuals make an impact on climate change by…”  
- Refer specifically to the idea of policy or government change, which is in your thesis.
- Keep the sentence focused on the individual's role with government, not other personal actions (since that comes in the next paragraph).

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now?**  
Aim for a clear connection to your thesis and an academic tone. If you need help, I can give you a model sentence as guidance—just ask! Go ahead and post your revised topic sentence, and we’ll review it together.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:03:24.993Z

**You:** can you show me some examples

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:07:13.647Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Here are some **example topic sentences** you can use as inspiration for your own revision. I’ll keep them focused on the idea of individuals influencing government, as stated in your thesis:

---

**Model Topic Sentences (for the paragraph about influencing government):**

1. “Individuals can play a powerful role in combating climate change by actively influencing government policies through collective action.”
2. “By participating in protests, voting, and advocacy, citizens are able to encourage governments to adopt stronger environmental regulations.”
3. “One significant way people help address climate change is by exerting pressure on policymakers to implement effective solutions.”
4. “Citizens can impact the fight against climate change by shaping public policy and holding governments accountable for environmental protection.”
5. “Influencing government decisions remains a key method by which individuals contribute to solving the climate crisis.”

---

**Prompt:**  
Using these examples for inspiration, would you like to try revising your topic sentence now?  
Remember to keep it connected to your thesis and focused on *how* individuals can make a difference through government influence.

Post your new topic sentence, and I’ll guide you further!

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:07:17.096Z

**You:** next step

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:09:06.787Z

**Assistant:** Excellent—it’s time for **Step 3: Revising the Rest of Your Chosen Paragraph!**

Let’s focus on the **supporting sentences and ideas** in the paragraph about individuals influencing the government.

**Here are your steps:**
1. Reread the paragraph and decide if every supporting detail clearly relates to your revised topic sentence.
2. Check for clarity: Are your examples and explanations easy to understand?
3. Look for unity and coherence: Do all your ideas flow logically, and is the paragraph well organized?
4. See if anything needs extra explanation or evidence to be convincing.

**Guiding questions for revision:**
- Does each example (protests, voting, new laws) clearly connect to the idea of citizens influencing government?
- Is there any sentence that feels off-topic or confusing?
- Can you add a phrase or word to make the logic clearer and more academic?
- Is there anywhere you could expand with a brief explanation, showing *why* citizen influence matters?

**Prompts for revision:**
- Try rewriting one or two supporting sentences for stronger clarity or detail.
- Check for repetition or awkward phrasing. Can you make any sentence smoother?
- If you notice anything incomplete or too vague (e.g., “But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action…”), how could you clarify or give an example?

Would you like to start by revising one supporting sentence?  
Go ahead and post your revision here, and I’ll give feedback and hints for further improvement! If you want, choose *one* sentence you’d like help with, and I can suggest ways to develop or clarify it—always keeping your own writing style.

Let’s take it step by step!

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:09:11.273Z

**You:** On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

*Time:* 2025-11-14T08:11:31.080Z

**Assistant:** Great job sharing the paragraph! Let's move through **Step 3: Revising the Supporting Sentences** of your chosen paragraph about individual green choices.

First, let's make sure the **supporting details** clearly relate to your updated topic sentence (which emphasizes the role individuals play through daily choices).

Here’s your paragraph again for easy reference:

> On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

**Let’s look at each supporting sentence:**

1. Are your examples (recycling, using less water, walking) clearly connected to the topic sentence?    *(Yes! Good job previewing the types of green choices.)*
2. Do your explanations make clear why these actions matter, even if they are “smaller” than government decisions?
3. Is there any confusion or awkwardness in your sentences?
4. Is there any place where you could expand with more explanation, or is anything repetitive?

---

**Let's try revising step by step.**

### Step 1: Clarify and expand where needed

For example, this sentence:
> “If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products.”

- Is there a way to clarify *how* these examples encourage change in companies? Which group is most influenced—other individuals, companies, or governments?
- Could you explain *why* companies respond to consumer choices?

**Prompts:**
- Would you like to try rewriting this sentence to be more specific? For instance: Do you want to focus on how individual action can influence industry or public attitude?  
- Can you give a brief example of a company changing based on consumer demand for green products?

Try a revision for that sentence!

---

### Step 2: Tidy up awkward phrases and language

These sentences could be smoother:
> “But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.”

- Can you make these sentences clearer and more formal? What is the key point you want to make here—that personal green actions alone may not be enough if not everyone participates?
- Is there a more academic way to express the challenge or limitation of relying on individual action?

**Prompt:** Try combining these ideas: for example, what would you say to show the limitation of only a few individuals changing their behavior?

---

### Step 3: Check for Unity and Flow

- Does the paragraph flow logically from individual action → possible impact → limitation of individual action?
- Is each sentence clearly tied back to your topic sentence about individual lifestyle choices?
- Is there a concluding sentence that sums up the paragraph’s main point?

**Assistant:** Nice job choosing this sentence to work on! Here’s some feedback and guiding questions:

**Original sentence:**
> For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit.

**Strengths:**
- This sentence gives a clear, relevant example showing how consumers can influence company behavior.
- The connection between consumer actions and business decisions is apparent.

**Tips for Revision:**

- If possible, briefly mention an example (real or general) for stronger support.

**Prompts for you:**
1. Can you use more formal language to explain how businesses respond to consumer choices?
2. Would you like to add a phrase about why this matters for the environment (e.g., by encouraging more sustainable production)?
3. Can you give a real-world or general example for illustration?
