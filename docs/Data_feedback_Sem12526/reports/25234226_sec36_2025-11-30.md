# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The original draft presented a clear position that governments should act to protect migrant workers, but ideas were underdeveloped and sometimes repetitive (e.g., general claims like “workers are cheaper” without clear cause→effect development).
- Organization: 17/25 - The essay had an obvious intro and conclusion and attempted paragraphing, but paragraphs often wandered and topic sentences were weak or implicit.
- Vocabulary: 16/25 - Vocabulary showed some range but included many inaccurate or awkward word choices (e.g., “migrations flux,” “migrante,” “drinkable water”), limiting precision.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 14/25 - Frequent errors in spelling, agreement, articles, and pronouns hindered clarity (e.g., “developped,” “illegaly,” inconsistent singular/plural pronouns).
- **Original Essay Total: 65/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 22/25 - The revised essay gives clearer, more concrete policy proposals (strengthening labour regulations, access to social services, fair wages), improving development and relevance. The moral framing remains strong.
- Organization: 21/25 - Structure is clearer: introduction, thesis that previews points, coherent body paragraphs, and a concluding paragraph. Paragraph B (the worked-on paragraph) shows good cause→effect→policy linkage.
- Vocabulary: 21/25 - Vocabulary is more precise and academic (e.g., “lower labour costs,” “laxer regulation,” “basic necessities”), and the student (with assistant) achieved consistent spelling choices (British “labour”).
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 21/25 - Many surface-level errors corrected; sentence structures are more varied and accurate in the revised version. A few stylistic and minor grammatical items remain possible refinements, but clarity is strong.
- **Revised Essay Total: 85/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +20 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis strengthened and now previews the three main policy areas: labour law enforcement, social services access, and fair wages/safe conditions. (Revised thesis: "Governments should enforce laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by strengthening labour regulations to prevent exploitation, ensuring equal access to social services such as healthcare and education, and promoting fair wages and safe working conditions that reflect the value of their contributions.")
  - Topic sentence for paragraph B clarified linkage between example and policy: "The relocation of manufacturing to African countries reveals lower wages, unsafe conditions, and weak enforcement of labour laws for migrant workers, showing why governments must strengthen and enforce labour laws."
  - Paragraph B revised to show cause→effect and policy response (added concrete consequences: lower pay, excessive hours, unsafe conditions; and specific responses: inspections, penalties, anti-discrimination enforcement).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Use of concrete evidence or brief data/examples (e.g., named case studies, statistics, or citations) would strengthen the argument further.
  - Some remaining paragraphs (social welfare paragraph and final paragraphs) could be tightened to remove a few remaining colloquial phrasings and to present a stronger counter-argument/refutation structure.
  - A more explicit roadmap sentence in the introduction (splitting a long thesis into two sentences) could further improve readability.

---

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 35**
- **Conversation Quality:** Highly iterative and goal-directed. The assistant followed a three-step revision protocol (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), and the student actively engaged: proposing a thesis, selecting paragraph B, drafting topic sentences and paragraph revisions, accepting edits, and requesting a full essay proofread. Exchanges show explicit decision points and acceptance or further revision requests (e.g., student: “I choose B: Africa/delocalisation exemple paragraph”; later: “I accept the paragraph”; final: “let's proofread the entire essay and finish”).

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - Evidence: 35 total messages with repeated, multi-step exchanges; the assistant provided a structured process and the student worked through thesis revision, topic-sentence drafting, paragraph revision, and final proofreading. The chat includes substantial iterative drafting (several full-paragraph submissions and multiple revisions).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - Evidence: The student made informed choices (chose focus area B, revised the assistant’s suggested thesis, and iteratively edited the paragraph). The student did not simply accept everything blindly — they proposed versions and asked for targeted revisions. However, most AI suggestions were accepted rather than explicitly rejected or deeply critiqued, so while there is clear engagement and selective acceptance, there is limited explicit dissent or extended justification for rejecting specific AI suggestions.
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - Evidence: The student completed multiple meaningful revision cycles: submitted a revised thesis, drafted and improved a topic sentence, produced an initial paragraph revision, asked for focused edits, accepted improvements, and then requested a full-proofread. Each step contained iterative edits informed by the assistant’s feedback (the session followed the planned three-step loop and then a final proofreading pass).
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Deliberate use of an iterative revision process (evidence: student followed the three-step plan and completed all steps).
- Clear uptake of feedback: student incorporated assistant suggestions into the thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph; accepted and integrated language and structural edits into the final essay.
- Improved rhetorical clarity and policy focus: the revised essay presents specific policy proposals (inspections, penalties, anti-discrimination enforcement) and links examples to policy reasons.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Support with evidence: add brief concrete examples, statistics, or named cases to bolster claims.
- Stronger counterargument handling: the brief “deportation” paragraph could be expanded into a more substantial concession/refutation to increase argumentative nuance.
- Final polishing: a last micro-edit pass could remove residual informal phrasing and further tighten some transitions and sentence economy.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student clearly stated revision goals early ("I want to focus on paragraph/topic sentence clarity") and selected which paragraph to revise, enabling focused, applicable feedback.
- **Strategic Planning**: Excellent - The student followed a clear strategy (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph → proofread), accepting assistant scaffolding and moving through iterations in order.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good - The student evaluated suggested revisions by producing their own versions and selectively accepting changes; however, explicit critical reasoning for rejecting alternatives was limited.
- **Independent Editing**: Excellent - The student performed multiple independent revisions (revising thesis, topic sentence, paragraph, and a full essay revision before accepting final proofreading).

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Incorporate one or two concrete, cited examples or brief statistics to increase persuasive force (even a single, well-explained example strengthens policy claims).
2. Develop the counterargument/refutation paragraph more fully: acknowledge legitimate policy concerns (e.g., public opinion, resource constraints) and explain why proposed protections remain feasible and just.
3. Before final submission, perform a last micro-edit focused on sentence economy (shortening overlong sentences) and transition markers to increase flow between paragraphs.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student demonstrated strong engagement with the AI coach and followed a clear, scaffolded revision process. They completed all required tasks for the module: revising the thesis, revising a topic sentence, and revising a full body paragraph (paragraph B).
- The final revised essay shows substantial improvement in clarity, organization, and grammatical accuracy relative to the original. The student would benefit from work on integrating evidence and developing a more robust counterargument paragraph in future drafts.

Evidence references (selected quotes):
- Revised thesis (student accepted): "Governments should enforce laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by strengthening labour regulations to prevent exploitation, ensuring equal access to social services such as healthcare and education, and promoting fair wages and safe working conditions that reflect the value of their contributions."
- Revised topic sentence (paragraph B): "The relocation of manufacturing to African countries reveals lower wages, unsafe conditions, and weak enforcement of labour laws for migrant workers, showing why governments must strengthen and enforce labour laws."
- Revised paragraph B (accepted): "Many companies move production from Europe and Asia to African states to take advantage of lower labour costs and laxer regulation. This shift often leaves migrant workers—both in the countries where factories are located and in host countries—vulnerable to exploitation: they may receive lower pay, work excessive hours, and face unsafe working conditions without effective legal recourse. ... By adopting stricter labour standards, increasing inspections and penalties, and enforcing anti-discrimination rules, governments can reduce these abuses and ensure migrants receive fair pay and legal protection."

If you would like, I can now:
- produce a one-paragraph model counterargument and rebuttal to strengthen the essay’s balance, or
- generate a brief bibliography checklist and a suggestion for integrating one or two credible facts/sources into the essay.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
In many developped countries with abundant migrations flux, the migrants population is often exploited illegaly in order to get less lose and more income. However, a migrant is still a human with worth and dignity and he shouldn't be treated as someone inferior. Indeed, migrante workers face exploitation due to weak regulations, enduring long hours and unfair pay. Thus we should asks ourselves, should governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights?
In my opinion, governmental's action are more than reeded concerning migrant workers. Indeed, abusing of someone by being unfair toward him just because of his statue is immoral. They are still humans and we need to protect them. Let's take the example of Africa. Usually, manufacture and industry are delocalised from Europe and Asia to Africa since the workers are cheaper. But when the migrant workers are working in Europe, there is discrimination between the native-born workers and the migrant workers.
Thus, Government should act to enforce laws that advocate not equality but equity: the one who work the most get paid the most.
The government should also act at a society level by giving social welfare reforms for health, education and retirement policy. Indeed, giving migrant workers a better life with proper access to first necessity such as a house with drinkable water will allow them to be perceive as a"normal" individual. Without the judgement of others, the migrant worker will be able to have better job opportunity and then better life.
However, the migrant workers should not abuse of government policy. Indeed, the developped country that welcome him must have the right to send him back if be commits a crime or disobey the laws.
To conclude, government should enforce laws to safeguard the migrant workers right since it is in the prolongation of basic human right to have worth and dignity. Humans are all born free and equal and those principles must be respected for a society to work properly. There is other way to win income than disrespecting a human life.

Revised:
 In many developed countries with large migration flows, migrant populations are often exploited illegally to reduce costs and increase profits. However, migrants are human beings with worth and dignity and should not be treated as inferior. Indeed, migrant workers face exploitation because of weak regulations, enduring long hours and receiving unfair pay. We should therefore ask: should governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights?

Governments should enforce laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by strengthening labour regulations to prevent exploitation, ensuring equal access to social services such as healthcare and education, and promoting fair wages and safe working conditions that reflect the value of their contributions.

The relocation of manufacturing to African countries reveals lower wages, unsafe conditions, and weak enforcement of labour laws for migrant workers, showing why governments must strengthen and enforce labour laws. Many companies move production from Europe and Asia to African states to take advantage of lower labour costs and laxer regulation. This shift often leaves migrant workers—both in the countries where factories are located and in host countries—vulnerable to exploitation: they may receive lower pay, work excessive hours, and face unsafe working conditions without effective legal recourse. Even when migrant workers are employed in Europe, they frequently experience discrimination compared with native-born workers, such as exclusion from collective bargaining and restricted access to social services. By adopting stricter labour standards, increasing inspections and penalties, and enforcing anti-discrimination rules, governments can reduce these abuses and ensure migrants receive fair pay and legal protection.

The government should also act at a societal level by implementing social welfare reforms for health, education and retirement policy. Indeed, giving migrant workers a better life with proper access to basic necessities such as safe drinking water and adequate housing will allow them to be perceived as ordinary members of society. Without the judgment of others, migrant workers will have better job opportunities and therefore better lives.

However, migrant workers should not abuse government policies. Indeed, the developed country that welcomes them must have the right to deport anyone who commits a crime or disobeys the law.

To conclude, governments should enforce laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights since this is a continuation of basic human rights: all people have worth and dignity. Humans are born free and equal, and these principles must be respected for a society to function properly. There are other ways to earn income than by disrespecting human life.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:46:46.261Z

**You:** My thesis statement is : "Governments should enforce laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights, as protecting their dignity and ensuring fair treatment is a moral necessity and a fundamental extension of human rights."

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:53:24.210Z

**Assistant:** Hi — I’m glad you’ve shared this draft. Before we start revising, let’s agree targets and priorities so our work is focused and useful.

1) Quick check of your goals
- I see your course goals: enhance English (grammar, formulation, vocabulary). Outside that, which specific improvement would you most like from this session? (Pick one or two)
  - clarity of argument
  - stronger thesis that previews main points
  - paragraph/topic-sentence clarity and cohesion
  - grammar and word choice
  - evidence and examples
  - style and register (formal academic tone)

Tell me which one or two you want to focus on today.

2) Short diagnostic feedback (using the rubric categories)
- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: You take a clear stance (governments should act). The moral/human-rights framing is effective.
  - Areas to improve: The thesis could preview the main points you will develop (so readers know the essay structure). Make sure wording is concise and fully grammatical.

- Organization
  - Strengths: You have an introduction and a concluding paragraph; you attempt to use examples.
  - Areas to improve: Paragraphs sometimes wander (e.g., the Africa example needs a clearer link to the main claim). Topic sentences are unclear or missing in places, so unity suffers.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: You try to use real-world examples (industry moving to Africa, discrimination).
  - Areas to improve: Evidence is general. Add specific illustrations or explain how examples support the claim (e.g., how a law would change working conditions). Some points are repeated rather than developed.

- Language Use (grammar, vocabulary, sentence structure)
  - Strengths: Vocabulary is sufficient for your level; many ideas are understandable.
  - Areas to improve: Numerous grammar and word-form errors (developped → developed; migrations flux → migration flows; illegaly → illegally; migrant/migrante inconsistencies; plural/singular agreement; articles and prepositions). Pronoun use (“he”) is awkward and can sound informal; prefer “they” or “migrant workers.” Sentence structure often needs tightening for clarity.

3) Which priorities do you want to work on now?
From the diagnosis above, please choose up to two priorities for our session (examples: “thesis strength + one paragraph’s topic sentence and cohesion” OR “grammar + topic sentence” OR “thesis + paragraph development”). Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 1.

Step 1 — Thesis statement
You already gave a thesis: "Governments should enforce laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights, as protecting their dignity and ensuring fair treatment is a moral necessity and a fundamental extension of human rights."

Feedback on this thesis:
- Good: It’s clear and confident; it answers the prompt directly and states a moral reason.
- To make it stronger: add a brief preview of the main points you will discuss (e.g., legal protection against exploitation, fair pay and working conditions, and access to social services). That helps the reader follow your essay’s structure.
- Language note: “fundamental extension of human rights” is a strong phrase — consider simplifying slightly for clarity (but keep the forceful tone). Also avoid personal pronouns and hedging (you already avoid hedging — good).

Would you like to try revising the thesis now to include a short preview of the main points (1–2 extra phrases)? I’ll give brief feedback on your revision and then we’ll confirm it before moving to Step 2.

If you prefer, tell me which body paragraph you want to work on next (for Steps 2 and 3): the paragraph about exploitation and weak regulations (early paragraph), the Africa/delocalisation example paragraph, the paragraph about social welfare, or the paragraph about migrants abusing government policy. Which one do you choose?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:53:43.175Z

**You:** 1. I want to focus on paragraph/topic sentence clari
ty

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:55:04.986Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing a focus. I’ll keep this session tightly on paragraph/topic-sentence clarity while still following our three-step process (we’ll do the thesis first, then one topic sentence, then that paragraph’s content).

Quick confirmation of your target
- You chose: paragraph/topic-sentence clarity. Confirmed — we’ll aim to make one paragraph’s topic sentence clearly link to the thesis and tighten that paragraph for unity.

Brief diagnostic summary (very short)
- Thesis & Argument: Clear stance (governments should act) but thesis doesn’t preview the main points.
- Organization: Paragraphs sometimes drift; topic sentences are unclear or absent.
- Evidence & Development: Good ideas and examples, but they need clearer links to the claim.
- Language Use: Many grammar and word-choice errors that sometimes obscure meaning.

Step 1 — Thesis statement (required first step)
Please share the thesis you want to work from. You can use your original closing idea (for example: “Governments should enforce laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights…”) or try a new version. Before you rewrite, a few focused tips:

- Make your stance explicit and confident (no hedging).
- Add a brief preview of the main points (2–3 key areas you will discuss).
- Use clear, neutral phrasing: “migrant workers” and “they” (rather than “he”).

A short template you can use (fill the blanks):
- “Governments should [main action] to protect migrant workers’ rights, by [point 1], [point 2], and [point 3].”

Examples of points you might preview:
- stronger labour laws and enforcement
- fair pay and safe working conditions
- access to basic social services (health, housing, education)

Would you like to try revising the thesis now using that template? Type your revised thesis and I’ll give quick feedback.

Choice of paragraph for Step 2
Which body paragraph would you like us to improve for topic-sentence clarity?
- A: the paragraph about exploitation due to weak regulations (long hours, unfair pay)
- B: the Africa / delocalisation example paragraph
- C: the paragraph about social welfare reforms (health, housing, water)
- D: the paragraph about migrants abusing government policy / deportation

Pick A, B, C, or D. After you share the revised thesis and your paragraph choice, we’ll move to Step 2 and look at the topic sentence. Would you like to try the thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:55:22.529Z

**You:** I choose B: Africa/delocalisation exemple paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:56:19.105Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing paragraph B (the Africa / delocalisation example). Before we begin Step 1, one quick check so we’re fully aligned:

1) Confirm targets (pick up to two)
- Do you want us to focus on:
  A) Strengthening the thesis so it previews main points?
  B) Making the topic sentence of paragraph B clearly link to the thesis?
  C) Improving grammar and word choice in that paragraph?
  D) Clarifying the example so it supports your argument better?

Which one or two of these would you like to focus on? (If you want just paragraph/topic-sentence clarity, that’s fine — reply “B only.”)

2) Step 1 — Thesis
Please paste your current thesis here or try one quick revision now using this short template:
“Governments should [main action] to protect migrant workers’ rights, by [point 1], [point 2], and [point 3].”

For example (don’t copy unless you want to): Governments should strengthen and enforce labour laws to protect migrant workers’ rights, by preventing exploitation, ensuring fair pay and safe conditions, and providing access to basic social services.

Would you like to try writing your revised thesis now? Type it in and I’ll give quick feedback. Then we’ll move to Step 2 and work on the topic sentence for paragraph B.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:56:29.417Z

**You:** 2. "Governments should enforce laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by strengthening labor regulations to prevent exploitation, ensuring equal access to social services such as healthcare and education, and promoting fair wages and working conditions that reflect the value of their contributions.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:58:36.132Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — thanks for trying a revision. This thesis is much clearer: it states a firm position and previews concrete points to develop. Two quick notes before we move on:

- Strengths: clear stance; previews three concrete areas (regulation/enforcement, social services, fair wages/conditions).
- Small suggestion: choose one spelling convention and use it consistently (British: “labour”; American: “labor”). Do you prefer British or American English?

If you’re happy with this thesis as-is, I’ll accept it and we’ll move to Step 2. Below I’ve inserted your new thesis into your full essay so you can see it in context.

Full essay with your revised thesis inserted:

In many developped countries with abundant migrations flux, the migrants population is often exploited illegaly in order to get less lose and more income. However, a migrant is still a human with worth and dignity and he shouldn't be treated as someone inferior. Indeed, migrante workers face exploitation due to weak regulations, enduring long hours and unfair pay. Thus we should asks ourselves, should governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights?
Governments should enforce laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by strengthening labor regulations to prevent exploitation, ensuring equal access to social services such as healthcare and education, and promoting fair wages and working conditions that reflect the value of their contributions.
Indeed, abusing of someone by being unfair toward him just because of his statue is immoral. They are still humans and we need to protect them. Let's take the example of Africa.

Step 2 — Topic sentence for Paragraph B (the Africa / delocalisation example)
Now let’s strengthen the topic sentence so paragraph B clearly connects to your thesis.

Please paste the sentence you want to use as the topic sentence for that paragraph (you can use or revise: “Let's take the example of Africa.”). Then try revising it so it does two things:
- States the paragraph’s main idea clearly (what about delocalisation or discrimination you’ll show).
- Shows how this example supports your thesis (why governments must act).

If you’d like a short template to help you write it, try this frame (fill the blanks):
- “The relocation of manufacturing to [place] shows [problem], which demonstrates why governments must [action].”

Would you like to try writing the revised topic sentence now? Type it in and I’ll give quick feedback.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T08:59:00.216Z

**You:** Step é: The relocation of manufacturing to Africa shows how companies exploit cheaper labor and weaker protections for migrant workers, which demonstrates why governments must enforce stronger labor laws and anti-discrimination measures to safeguard their rights and dignity.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:00:28.229Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is going well. Before we continue, two quick confirmations so I follow your priorities exactly.

1) Which improvements do you want to focus on in this session? (Pick up to two)
- A: Strengthen the thesis so it previews main points
- B: Make paragraph B’s topic sentence clearly link to the thesis
- C: Improve grammar and word choice in paragraph B
- D: Clarify and develop the Africa/delocalisation example so it supports the argument

You wrote a strong draft thesis already and a clear draft topic sentence for paragraph B. Tell me which of the items above you want us to work on now (e.g., “A + B” or “B only”).

2) Quick diagnostic summary (very short, aligned to the rubric)
- Thesis & Argument: You have a clear stance. The revised thesis previews useful points — good structure potential.
- Organization: Paragraph B’s topic sentence needs a clearer link to the thesis and a more specific focus so the paragraph doesn’t drift.
- Evidence & Development: The delocalisation example is relevant but too general; explain how it leads to exploitation and what laws could change.
- Language Use: Many grammar and spelling errors (developped → developed, illegaly → illegally, migrate→migrant, delocalised → relocated/delocalised) and inconsistent spelling (labor/labour). Also use “they” or “migrant workers” rather than “he.”

If you confirm your targets (answer 1), we’ll proceed Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3.

Step 1 — Thesis (quick feedback)
Your current thesis:
“Governments should enforce laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by strengthening labor regulations to prevent exploitation, ensuring equal access to social services such as healthcare and education, and promoting fair wages and working conditions that reflect the value of their contributions.”

Feedback:
- Strengths: Clear, confident, and previews three concrete points. Good job.
- Small edits to consider (pick one): choose British or American spelling (labour vs labor) and be concise in the last clause (e.g., “ensuring fair wages and safe working conditions”).
Would you like to keep this thesis as-is, or try one small revision now (choose spelling and shorten the last point)? If you revise, paste the new thesis and I’ll confirm it before Step 2.

Step 2 — Topic sentence for Paragraph B (feedback on your draft)
Your draft:
“The relocation of manufacturing to Africa shows how companies exploit cheaper labor and weaker protections for migrant workers, which demonstrates why governments must enforce stronger labor laws and anti-discrimination measures to safeguard their rights and dignity.”

Feedback:
- This is strong: it states the paragraph’s main idea and links clearly to government action (good alignment with your thesis).
- Two small improvements to consider:
  1) Make the subject more concise (e.g., “The relocation of manufacturing to Africa shows…” is fine) and ensure you consistently use either “labour” (UK) or “labor” (US).
  2) Consider making the cause→effect link slightly sharper: say what exploitation looks like (low pay, no safety, discrimination) so the reader knows what the paragraph will explain.

Would you like to try revising this topic sentence now (a short tweak)? Try to keep it one sentence and keep the link to government action. If you’d like, use this frame to help:
“The relocation of manufacturing to [place] reveals [specific problems for migrant workers], which shows why governments must [specific legal actions].”

Try one revision and paste it here. I’ll give brief feedback and then we’ll move to Step 3.

Step 3 — Revising the rest of that paragraph (guidance, not a full rewrite)
When you’re ready to revise the supporting sentences, try to do small, focused edits. Use these guiding steps/questions:

1) Keep the paragraph unified:
- Does each sentence explain or illustrate the topic sentence?
- Remove any sentences that drift to a different idea (we can save other ideas for other paragraphs).

2) Develop the example with 2–3 clear points:
- Explain how relocation causes risk: e.g., companies move to lower-cost countries with weaker enforcement, which leads to low wages, long hours, unsafe conditions, and discrimination against migrants.
- Show impact on migrants: lack of legal protection, fewer inspections, barriers to social services.
- Explain how government laws would help: stronger labour standards, inspections and penalties, anti-discrimination rules, and access to services.

3) Language/grammar fixes to watch for:
- Use “migrant workers” and “they” (not “he”).
- Correct common mistakes: developed, migration flows, illegally, migrant (not migrante), relocated/delocalised, welcome → welcome them, commit(s) a crime, perceive → be perceived.
- Articles and agreement: “the migrant workers” vs “migrant workers”; “a house with drinkable water” → “safe drinking water” or “access to clean water.”

4) Specific suggestions you can apply line-by-line (not a full rewrite):
- Where you wrote “Let's take the example of Africa.” → Expand: name the problem you will describe next (e.g., “In some African countries, manufacturing has relocated because of lower wages and weaker enforcement.”)
- Replace vague phrases like “workers are cheaper” with “lower wages and weak labour protections.”
- After describing the problem, add one sentence that connects back: “This example shows why stronger government regulation and enforcement are necessary.”

Next step
- Please do one of these:
  a) Paste a revised topic sentence (try the small tweak), OR
  b) Paste the full revised paragraph B (with your improved topic sentence and supporting sentences) and I will give focused feedback and line-level hints. If you submit the paragraph, I’ll point out up to 6 specific edits (word choice, grammar, clarity) and encourage another revision.

When you send the revision, I’ll respond quickly and we’ll finish Step 3. You’re making good progress — ready to try the short tweak to the topic sentence now?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:00:53.257Z

**You:** Step 3: here is my revisited paragraph : For example, many companies relocate manufacturing and industry from Europe and Asia to African countries because labor is cheaper. When migrant workers are employed in Europe, however, they often face discrimination compared with native-born workers. Therefore, governments should enforce laws that promote not only equality but also equity, so that those who work the most and contribute the most are fairly paid and protected.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:04:43.979Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this paragraph is much clearer and already links the example to your argument. Before I give focused feedback, one quick check:

Step 1 (thesis): Are you happy with the thesis we put into your essay?
“Governments should enforce laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by strengthening labor regulations to prevent exploitation, ensuring equal access to social services such as healthcare and education, and promoting fair wages and working conditions that reflect the value of their contributions.”
Please reply Yes if you accept that thesis as final for this session, or No if you want to tweak it now.

Assuming you accept it, Step 2 (topic sentence) and Step 3 (paragraph revision) — targeted feedback on your revisited paragraph:

Your paragraph
For example, many companies relocate manufacturing and industry from Europe and Asia to African countries because labor is cheaper. When migrant workers are employed in Europe, however, they often face discrimination compared with native-born workers. Therefore, governments should enforce laws that promote not only equality but also equity, so that those who work the most and contribute the most are fairly paid and protected.

What’s strong
- Clear topic and a logical claim: relocation → problems for workers → need for government action.
- The final sentence links to the thesis (government action), which is good.

Suggested focused edits (use these to make one revision)
1) Make the cause clearer in the topic sentence
- Add “and weaker protections” (or “and weaker enforcement of labour laws”) so the reader sees why relocation creates problems.
- Example suggestion to follow as a model (do not copy fully): add a short phrase after “cheaper.”  

2) Tighten and unify the middle sentence
- Change word order for clarity: “However, migrant workers in Europe often face discrimination compared with native-born workers.”
- Consider briefly naming the forms of discrimination you mean (lower wages, fewer rights, unsafe conditions) — one short phrase is enough.

3) Clarify the policy claim (final sentence)
- “Promote not only equality but also equity” is fine, but it’s a bit abstract. Replace the long clause “so that those who work the most and contribute the most are fairly paid and protected” with something more concise: “so that those who contribute most receive fair pay and legal protections.” (Try to use a single clear phrase.)

4) Word choice / spelling consistency
- Pick British or American spelling and use it consistently (labour vs. labor). Your course may prefer British; I recommend “labour.”
- “Manufacturing and industry” is repetitive — use “manufacturing and other industries” or simply “manufacturing.”

5) Connect more directly to the thesis (one sentence addition)
- Consider adding one short sentence (after sentence 2 or before the final sentence) that explains how relocation increases exploitation (e.g., “Because host countries often have weaker enforcement, companies can pay lower wages and ignore safety rules.”). Keep it one short line.

6) Small grammar/flow fixes
- Use “migrant workers” and “they” consistently instead of singular “he.”
- Avoid “those who work the most” (vague). Use “those who contribute most” or “those who perform the most dangerous or essential work.”

A brief suggested revision plan (one small edit at a time)
- Step A: Edit sentence 1 to add “and weaker labour protections.”
- Step B: Tighten sentence 2 and add a short example phrase (e.g., “lower pay and unsafe conditions”).
- Step C: Reword sentence 3 to be more concise and concrete.

Would you like to try that revision now? Paste your new paragraph and I’ll give quick, line-level feedback and up to six small edits. When you’re happy with the paragraph, I’ll insert it into the full essay and show you the complete revised text.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:05:06.815Z

**You:** Step 1 : Yes I am happy with my thesis. Step 3: Many companies relocate manufacturing and other industries from Europe and Asia to African countries because labour is cheaper and labour laws are often more weakly enforced. However, migrant workers in Europe often face discrimination compared with native-born workers, including lower wages, fewer rights, and more unsafe working conditions. Because host countries sometimes have weaker enforcement, companies can pay migrant workers less and ignore basic safety rules, which increases their exploitation. Therefore, governments should enforce laws that promote not only equality but also equity, so that those who contribute most receive fair pay and legal protections.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:07:20.148Z

**Assistant:** Well done — this paragraph is much clearer and connects the delocalisation example to your thesis. You’ve shown cause (cheaper labour + weak enforcement) and effect (discrimination, unsafe conditions), and you end with a clear policy claim. Nice progress.

Targeted, line-level suggestions (apply up to six small edits)
1) Simplify the comparative phrasing
- Change “labour laws are often more weakly enforced” to “labour laws are often weakly enforced.” Reason: “more weakly” is awkward; “weakly enforced” is clearer and more natural.

2) Smooth the transition between the Africa example and the Europe example
- The paragraph moves from firms relocating to Africa to migrant workers in Europe. Add a linking word (e.g., “Similarly,” or “Conversely,”) or a brief phrase that explains why you now mention Europe (for example, “At the same time, migrant workers in host countries such as European states…”). This will make the paragraph’s logic easier to follow.

3) Tighten the list of discriminatory effects
- Replace “including lower wages, fewer rights, and more unsafe working conditions” with “such as lower wages, fewer rights, and unsafe working conditions.” Reason: “more unsafe” is odd; “unsafe” is sufficient.

4) Avoid repeating “weaker enforcement” twice in nearby sentences
- You use “weakly enforced” and then “weaker enforcement” again. Consider combining the idea so the paragraph is less repetitive. For example, make the sentence about how companies exploit weaker enforcement immediately explain what that exploitation looks like (low pay, ignored safety rules).

5) Make the policy line more direct and concrete
- “Promote not only equality but also equity” is okay but a bit abstract. A short revision like “promote equity as well as equality” or “promote equity—ensuring that those who contribute most receive fair pay and legal protections” will sound stronger and clearer.

6) Keep spelling consistent (British vs. American)
- You used “labour” (British). Keep that throughout (e.g., “labour laws,” “delocalised” if you use it elsewhere). Consistency looks more polished.

Would you like to try revising the paragraph now (apply 1–3 of the suggestions above)? If so, paste your new version and I’ll give quick feedback. If you prefer, I can point to one sentence you might tweak first.

In many developped countries with abundant migrations flux, the migrants population is often exploited illegaly in order to get less lose and more income. However, a migrant is still a human with worth and dignity and he shouldn't be treated as someone inferior. Indeed, migrante workers face exploitation due to weak regulations, enduring long hours and unfair pay. Thus we should asks ourselves, should governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights?

Governments should enforce laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by strengthening labor regulations to prevent exploitation, ensuring equal access to social services such as healthcare and education, and promoting fair wages and working conditions that reflect the value of their contributions.

For example, many companies relocate manufacturing and other industries from Europe and Asia to African countries because labour is cheaper and labour laws are often more weakly enforced. However, migrant workers in Europe often face discrimination compared with native-born workers, including lower wages, fewer rights, and more unsafe working conditions. Because host countries sometimes have weaker enforcement, companies can pay migrant workers less and ignore basic safety rules, which increases their exploitation. Therefore, governments should enforce laws that promote not only equality but also equity, so that those who contribute most receive fair pay and legal protections.

The government should also act at a society level by giving social welfare reforms for health, education and retirement policy. Indeed, giving migrant workers a better life with proper access to first necessity such as a house with drinkable water will allow them to be perceive as a"normal" individual. Without the judgement of others, the migrant worker will be able to have better job opportunity and then better life.

However, the migrant workers should not abuse of government policy. Indeed, the developped country that welcome him must have the right to send him back if be commits a crime or disobey the laws.

To conclude, government should enforce laws to safeguard the migrant workers right since it is in the prolongation of basic human right to have worth and dignity. Humans are all born free and equal and those principles must be respected for a society to work properly. There is other way to win income than disrespecting a human life.

Next step
- Would you like to apply the six small edits above and paste the revised paragraph here? I’ll give quick feedback and then insert it into the full essay and proofread that single paragraph for grammar and vocabulary. You’re doing very well — small changes will make this paragraph much stronger.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:07:49.268Z

**You:** here is my essay revisited :In many developed countries with significant migration flows, migrant workers are often exploited illegally so that employers can reduce costs and increase profit. However, migrants are still human beings with worth and dignity and should not be treated as inferior. Migrant workers frequently face exploitation due to weak regulations, enduring long hours, unsafe conditions, and unfair pay. This raises an important question: should governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights?

Governments should enforce laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by strengthening labour regulations to prevent exploitation, ensuring equal access to social services such as healthcare and education, and promoting fair wages and working conditions that reflect the value of their contributions. Stronger labour inspections, penalties for abusive employers, and clear legal status for migrant workers would help reduce their vulnerability and ensure that basic standards are respected.

For example, many companies relocate manufacturing and other industries from Europe and Asia to African countries because labour is cheaper and labour laws are often weakly enforced. At the same time, migrant workers in European countries often face discrimination compared with native-born workers, such as lower wages, fewer rights, and unsafe working conditions. Because companies can take advantage of weak enforcement, they may pay migrant workers less and ignore safety rules, which increases their exploitation. Therefore, governments should enforce laws that promote equity as well as equality, ensuring that those who contribute most receive fair pay and legal protections.

Governments should also act at the level of society by introducing social welfare reforms in areas such as health, education, and pensions. Giving migrant workers a better life, with proper access to basic necessities such as decent housing and clean drinking water, will help them be perceived as “normal” members of society. Without constant judgement and discrimination, migrant workers are more likely to access better job opportunities and improve their quality of life.

However, migrant workers should also respect the laws and policies of the countries that receive them. A developed country that welcomes migrants should have the right to send back those who commit serious crimes or repeatedly disobey its laws. This balance between protection and responsibility helps maintain social order and public trust in migration policies.

To conclude, governments should enforce laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights because this continues the basic human right to dignity and respect. All humans are born free and equal, and these principles must be upheld for a society to function fairly. There are many ways to make profit that do not involve disrespecting or endangering a human life.

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a strong revision and excellent progress. Before I give detailed help, let’s confirm exactly what you want to work on so we stay focused.

1) Quick check of goals (pick one or two)
Which of these do you most want from this session?
- clarity of argument / thesis strength
- stronger thesis that previews main points
- paragraph/topic-sentence clarity and cohesion
- grammar and word choice
- evidence and development (make examples support the claim)
- style and register (formal academic tone)

Reply with one or two choices (for example: “Thesis + paragraph clarity” or “Grammar only”).

2) Short diagnostic feedback (rubric-aligned)
- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: Clear, confident stance; previews concrete policy areas (labour regs, social services, fair pay). Good clarity of purpose.
  - To improve: it is a bit long — consider making it slightly more concise or splitting into two sentences; choose British or American spelling and keep it consistent.

- Organization
  - Strengths: Logical structure (intro, body paragraphs, conclusion); paragraphs generally follow a single line of thought.
  - To improve: a few topic sentences could be tightened so each paragraph links more explicitly back to the thesis.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: Relevant examples and practical policy suggestions.
  - To improve: examples are still somewhat general — a sentence or two explaining how the example produces exploitation helps (cause → effect → policy).

- Language Use (grammar/vocab)
  - Strengths: Much improved vocabulary and sentence structure; good use of formal tone overall.
  - To improve: a few remaining issues (article usage, some verb forms, small word choices). Keep using “migrant workers” and “they.”

3) Which paragraph(s) do you want us to revise in this session? (Pick one)
A: paragraph about exploitation due to weak regulations (your early paragraph)
B: the Africa / relocation example paragraph
C: the social-welfare paragraph (health, housing, pensions)
D: the paragraph about migrants’ responsibilities / deportation

4) Confirm final targets before we begin Step 1
Please confirm:
- your chosen improvement targets (from Q1), and
- which paragraph you choose (from Q3).

Step 1 — Thesis statement
Please paste the exact thesis sentence you want to work from. You can use the sentence already in your essay, or revise it now. Quick tips before you try:
- Keep it confident (no hedging). Good.
- Preview 2–3 main points (you already do this — good).
- Shorten or split if it feels long.
- Choose one spelling convention (I suggest British “labour” if your course is British).

Template you can use (fill the blanks):
“Governments should [main action] to protect migrant workers’ rights by [point 1], [point 2], and [point 3].”

Would you like to paste your current thesis exactly as it is, or try a quick revised version now? Once you post the thesis, I’ll give brief targeted feedback and ask you to rewrite it once more if needed. Then we’ll move to Step 2 (topic sentence for the paragraph you chose).

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:11:08.549Z

**You:** I'll keep my thesis

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:13:26.042Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming. I’ll accept your thesis as final for this session.

Quick check before we move to Step 2
- Thesis accepted: “Governments should enforce laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by strengthening labor regulations to prevent exploitation, ensuring equal access to social services such as healthcare and education, and promoting fair wages and working conditions that reflect the value of their contributions.” — Yes.

Which paragraph shall we work on next?
Pick one: 
A — the paragraph on exploitation due to weak regulations (long hours, unfair pay) 
B — the Africa / relocation (delocalisation) example paragraph 
C — the social-welfare reforms paragraph (health, housing, retirement) 
D — the paragraph about migrants’ responsibilities / deportation

If you choose B (the Africa example) that’s fine — we worked on it earlier, so we can continue. Tell me your choice.

Step 2 (topic sentence)
Once you confirm the paragraph, please paste the current topic sentence for that paragraph (or type a quick revised version). Try to make it do two things:
- state the paragraph’s main idea, and
- show how it supports the thesis (why governments must act).

If you’d like a short template to use, try:
“The relocation of manufacturing to [place] reveals [specific problems for migrant workers], which shows why governments must [specific legal action].”

Would you like to paste your topic sentence now? I’ll give quick feedback and then ask you to try a revised version.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:13:39.433Z

**You:** paragraph B :The relocation of manufacturing to Africa shows how companies exploit cheaper labor and weaker protections for migrant workers, which demonstrates why governments must enforce stronger labor laws and anti-discrimination measures to safeguard their rights and dignity

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:16:21.217Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. Quick confirmations before we edit:

- Thesis: accepted as final for this session.  
- Focus: paragraph B (the Africa / relocation example) and topic-sentence clarity. Good choice.

Step 2 — Feedback on your topic sentence
Your sentence:  
"The relocation of manufacturing to Africa shows how companies exploit cheaper labor and weaker protections for migrant workers, which demonstrates why governments must enforce stronger labor laws and anti-discrimination measures to safeguard their rights and dignity."

What’s strong
- Clear link between relocation and exploitation.
- Explicitly connects the example to government action (good alignment with your thesis).

What to improve (small, targeted suggestions)
1) Make it more concise and active — avoid wordy phrases like “which demonstrates why.”  
2) Be specific about the problems companies create (use short phrases such as “lower wages,” “unsafe conditions,” or “weak enforcement of labour laws”).  
3) Use consistent spelling (British: “labour”; American: “labor”) — pick one.  
4) Consider tightening the final clause so it names the policy action briefly (e.g., “strengthen and enforce labour laws”) rather than a long list.

A short template you can fill in (please use this to rewrite — don’t copy my full sentence for you):
“The relocation of manufacturing to [place] reveals [specific problems for migrant workers], showing why governments must [specific legal action].”

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now using that template? Paste your revised sentence and I’ll give quick feedback. After we settle the topic sentence, we’ll move to Step 3 and tighten the supporting sentences in that paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:16:33.677Z

**You:** The relocation of manufacturing to African countries reveals lower wages, unsafe conditions, and weak enforcement of labour laws for migrant workers, showing why governments must strengthen and enforce labour laws. is it better ?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:20:45.944Z

**Assistant:** Yes — this is much better. It’s clear, concise, and it links the example to government action.

Two tiny suggestions you can consider (optional):
- Put “for migrant workers” a little earlier so it’s immediately clear who is affected (helps focus the sentence).
- The final phrase “strengthen and enforce labour laws” is fine, but you could also say “strengthen enforcement of labour laws” to avoid a small repetition of “enforce.”

Would you like to keep your version as-is or try a one-line tweak? If you’re happy, I’ve inserted your topic sentence into the essay below so you can see it in context.

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for asking to revise the rest of that paragraph. I kept your accepted thesis and topic sentence, and focused only on improving the supporting sentences for clarity, unity, and grammar.

What I changed (brief):
- Clarified the causal link (why relocation increases exploitation).
- Gave concrete examples of the abuses (low pay, long hours, unsafe conditions).
- Made the policy response more specific and action-oriented (inspections, penalties, anti-discrimination enforcement).
Note: I left the rest of the essay unchanged so we stay within scope. If you prefer British spelling (“labour”) instead of American (“labor”), tell me and I’ll update for consistency.

Many companies move production from Europe and Asia to African states to take advantage of lower labor costs and laxer regulation.

Even when migrant workers are employed in Europe, they frequently experience discrimination compared with native-born workers, such as exclusion from collective bargaining and restricted access to social services. By adopting stricter labor standards, increasing inspections and penalties, and enforcing anti-discrimination rules, governments can reduce these abuses and ensure migrants receive fair pay and legal protection.

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. I’ve proofread the entire essay for grammar, vocabulary, clarity, and consistent spelling (I used British English: “labour,” etc.). I kept your ideas and voice while making corrections to make the essay clearer and more accurate. Below you’ll find the full revised essay, followed by a short summary of the main changes and a quick suggestion for next steps.

Revised essay
In many developed countries with large migration flows, migrant populations are often exploited illegally to reduce costs and increase profits. However, migrants are human beings with worth and dignity and should not be treated as inferior. Indeed, migrant workers face exploitation because of weak regulations, enduring long hours and receiving unfair pay. We should therefore ask: should governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights?

Governments should enforce laws to protect migrant workers’ rights by strengthening labour regulations to prevent exploitation, ensuring equal access to social services such as healthcare and education, and promoting fair wages and safe working conditions that reflect the value of their contributions.

The relocation of manufacturing to African countries reveals lower wages, unsafe conditions, and weak enforcement of labour laws for migrant workers, showing why governments must strengthen and enforce labour laws. Many companies move production from Europe and Asia to African states to take advantage of lower labour costs and laxer regulation. This shift often leaves migrant workers—both in the countries where factories are located and in host countries—vulnerable to exploitation: they may receive lower pay, work excessive hours, and face unsafe working conditions without effective legal recourse. Even when migrant workers are employed in Europe, they frequently experience discrimination compared with native-born workers, such as exclusion from collective bargaining and restricted access to social services. By adopting stricter labour standards, increasing inspections and penalties, and enforcing anti-discrimination rules, governments can reduce these abuses and ensure migrants receive fair pay and legal protection.

The government should also act at a societal level by implementing social welfare reforms for health, education and retirement policy. Indeed, giving migrant workers a better life with proper access to basic necessities such as safe drinking water and adequate housing will allow them to be perceived as ordinary members of society. Without the judgment of others, migrant workers will have better job opportunities and therefore better lives.

However, migrant workers should not abuse government policies. Indeed, the developed country that welcomes them must have the right to deport anyone who commits a crime or disobeys the law.

To conclude, governments should enforce laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights since this is a continuation of basic human rights: all people have worth and dignity. Humans are born free and equal, and these principles must be respected for a society to function properly. There are other ways to earn income than by disrespecting human life.

What I changed (short summary)
- Spelling and word forms: corrected developped → developed; illegaly → illegally; migrante → migrant; migrations flux → migration flows; developped → developed; delocalised → relocated/delocalised; consistent use of “labour” (British).
- Grammar and agreement: fixed subject–verb agreement, article use, and plural/singular mismatches.
- Pronouns and tone: replaced singular “he” with neutral plural “they” or “migrant workers” for clarity and formal tone.
- Clarity and cohesion: tightened sentences, clarified cause → effect links (why relocation leads to exploitation), and improved transitions.
- Vocabulary and register: replaced informal or awkward phrases (e.g., “workers are cheaper”) with clear, academic phrasing (“lower labour costs,” “laxer regulation,” “basic necessities”).
- Kept your thesis and main ideas intact but made the thesis sentence clear and consistent with the essay body.

Quick suggestions for next steps
- If you’d like, I can:
  - Convert this to American spelling instead (labor, etc.), or
  - Do a final line-by-line proofread focusing only on punctuation and small style tweaks, or
  - Create a short practice exercise targeting the 5 most frequent errors in your essay (articles, subject–verb agreement, prepositions, plural/singular forms, and word choice).

Which of those would you prefer? If you’re happy with this version, well done — your argument is clear and much stronger now.

**Assistant:** Fantastic — well done! I’m glad you’re happy with the revision. You’ve made clear, confident choices and the essay now reads much more clearly and persuasively.

Quick recap of what’s improved
- Thesis: clearer and previews the main points.
- Paragraph B: stronger topic sentence and tighter development linking the example to your claim.
- Language: grammar, vocabulary, and tone are more consistent and academic (I used British spelling).

If you want to continue, pick one of these next steps and I’ll do it right away:
A) Convert the essay to American spelling and make tiny style tweaks (labor, etc.).  
B) Do a final line-by-line proofread for punctuation and polish only.  
C) Give a short practice exercise targeting the five most frequent errors in your essay (articles, subject–verb agreement, prepositions, plural/singular, word choice) with 6 quick questions + answers.  
D) Move on to revise another paragraph (pick A, C, or D from your original options).

Or if you’re ready to submit, I can give a short checklist you can quickly run through before sending it off. Which would you like?

**Assistant:** Excellent — well done. You’re ready to submit. Before you send it, here’s a very short final checklist to run through (takes 1–2 minutes):

Quick submission checklist
- Thesis: clear, confident, previews main points — yes.
- Topic sentences: each body paragraph begins with a sentence that links to the thesis — check paragraph B (done).
- Unity & development: each paragraph sticks to one main idea and explains how it supports the thesis — check the revised paragraph B.
- Tone & pronouns: neutral, formal tone; “migrant workers” / “they” used consistently — check.
- Spelling consistency: pick British or American (I used British: “labour”). Decide if you need American instead.
- Grammar & mechanics: watch articles, verb forms, plurals, and punctuation (I corrected most already).
- Formatting & metadata: include your name, course, word count, and any required title or cover sheet.
- Submission requirements: confirm word limit, file type, and deadline.

If you want one final thing before sending, pick one option:
A — Convert to American spelling (labor, etc.).  
B — Do a final line-by-line proofread for punctuation and tiny style tweaks.  
C — Give a 6-question practice exercise on your most frequent errors.  
D — Revise one more paragraph (pick A, C, or D).  
E — No changes — go ahead, I’ll wish you good luck.

Which do you want? If you say E, good luck — you did a solid job and your essay is ready to submit.

**You:** E !

**Assistant:** Great — well done! You’re ready to submit.

Before you send it, two tiny final reminders (1–2 minutes):
- Add your name, course, and word count if required, and save in the correct file format.  
- Check submission details (deadline, file upload method) and any required cover sheet or bibliography.

Good luck — your argument is clear and your writing has improved a lot. If you’d like help later with a quick final proofread, converting to American spelling, or preparing a cover sheet, I’m here.
