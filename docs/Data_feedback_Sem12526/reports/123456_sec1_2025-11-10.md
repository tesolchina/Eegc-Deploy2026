            ## Contribution Analysis

            It seems that the student did not respond to the AI assistant’s initial prompt, and therefore no revision process took place. To help the student move forward, you could try a more engaging and supportive approach, such as:

- Gently prompt the student again to identify the thesis statement, possibly by providing guidance on what makes a thesis effective.
- Offer an example of a revised thesis statement with two clear main points to model what is expected.
- Encourage the student to reply with their own version or questions about the thesis.
- Highlight specific benefits of revising the thesis for clarity and focus in the essay.

If you want, I can draft a sample follow-up message you could use to re-engage the student and foster more interaction. Would you like me to prepare that?

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 – The essay presents a clear stance and addresses relevant points about individual versus government/company actions regarding climate change. Some examples and critical judgements are provided, but analysis could be deeper.
- Organization: 20/25 – The essay is generally well-organized, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion. Logical progression is present, but paragraphs could be better signposted and transitions strengthened.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 – Language use is mostly adequate but lacks variety; topic-specific terms (“carbon emissions,” “eco-friendly products”) are present but sometimes repetitive or simplistic.
- Grammar: 17/25 – There are a number of grammatical errors (“so is not always working well,” “so nothing happen”), and some awkward sentences reduce clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 75/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 – No identifiable changes or conceptual development; the essay's message and examples remain the same.
- Organization: 20/25 – Paragraphing and flow are unchanged.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 – No improvement in variety or precision.
- Grammar: 17/25 – Errors persist; sentences remain unedited.
- **Revised Essay Total: 75/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - No revision of thesis statement, topic sentence, or body paragraph evident.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Thesis statement could be strengthened to clarify two distinct main points.
  - Topic sentences could be clarified/expanded for better guidance.
  - Body paragraphs could be revised for grammar, clarity, and coherence.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 1**
- **Conversation Quality:** Minimal. The exchange consists of only the AI assistant's introductory message, inviting the student to locate the thesis statement. No further student interaction is seen.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation:** 1/5 – No student response, discussion, or questions; the chat is limited to an initial prompt only.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions:** 1/5 – No evidence of any evaluation, acceptance, or rejection of AI suggestions.
- **Refining Process:** 1/5 – No revision steps or iterations.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 3/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The initial essay addresses the essay question adequately and presents relevant ideas with some examples.
- The student has accessed the AI training module and received initial guidance.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Student must engage with the AI assistant and respond to prompts to facilitate revision.
- Required tasks (thesis statement, topic sentence, body paragraph revision) were not completed.
- Student should demonstrate critical thinking by evaluating AI advice and incorporating feedback into iterative revisions.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision:** Needs Improvement – No context or goals communicated to AI beyond submitting the essay.
- **Strategic Planning:** Needs Improvement – No evidence of planning or revision steps.
- **Critical Evaluation:** Needs Improvement – No critical discussion or evaluation of AI suggestions was present.
- **Independent Editing:** Needs Improvement – No student-driven editing or improvement of the draft.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Actively participate in chat exchanges; respond to AI prompts and questions to initiate the revision process.
2. Complete the required revision steps (thesis, topic sentence, body paragraph) as outlined in the module.
3. Practice critically assessing AI feedback and use AI suggestions to make substantial changes to writing.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- Student did not progress in the training mode and has not completed required revision tasks.
- Recommend intervention to encourage engagement and follow-up on AI collaboration strategies.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.
