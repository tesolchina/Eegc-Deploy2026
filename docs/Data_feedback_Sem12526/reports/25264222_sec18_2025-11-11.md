            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing the assessment report and chat history. Here is a concise summary and next-step recommendations to help you improve your writing and interaction with AI in future sessions:

---

### Summary of Your Session and Writing:

- You identified the original thesis but did not revise it as requested.
- You also did not revise topic sentences or body paragraphs.
- Your essay remains as originally submitted, without improvements in argument clarity, vocabulary range, or grammar.
- Your chat responses were brief, and you chose to skip revision steps.
- The AI provided clear, structured guidance to help you improve but you did not engage deeply with those prompts.

---

### Key Suggestions to Try Next Time:

1. **Engage with the revision steps:**
   - When asked to revise the thesis, topic sentences, or paragraphs, try drafting a new version.
   - You don’t have to make it perfect—just attempt the changes based on the feedback.

2. **Use AI prompts as learning opportunities:**
   - AI offers suggestions to guide you. Ask questions if something is unclear.
   - Try different versions and ask for feedback to refine your writing.

3. **Develop a clearer thesis:**
   - Include your main points explicitly (influence on government + personal lifestyle choices).
   - Use confident language—avoid vague phrases like “I partly agree.”

4. **Work on topic sentences and paragraph detail:**
   - Topic sentences should clearly state the paragraph’s main idea.
   - Add examples or explanations to strengthen arguments.

5. **Improve your interaction style:**
   - Respond fully to AI prompts instead of skipping.
   - Reflect on suggestions and justify your choices.

---

### Practical Next Step:

Would you like me to guide you now through revising your thesis statement, step by step? Starting there will make the rest of the revision easier. You can also ask me to help rewrite topic sentences or body paragraphs next.

Feel free to share a draft revision or ask for examples! I’m here to support your writing growth.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES

Student was present and located thesis statement but did not perform the required revision tasks, nor did they attempt to engage with the AI suggestions for improvement. Recommend a follow-up to encourage active participation and basic revision skills. Consider scaffolding with more structured prompts to encourage engagement in subsequent sessions.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:08:48.962Z

**You:** people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:13:26.598Z

**Assistant:** Great, thank you for sharing your thesis statement!  
**First, let’s focus on Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision.**

Here’s your current thesis:  
> “People argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea.”

### My Feedback:

**Clarity:**  
- Your thesis is clear in showing your point of view ("partly agree"), but it could be stronger and more precise.

**Strength and Focus:**  
- It would help to show *why* you partly agree—give readers a preview of your main arguments.
- Try to avoid phrases like "I partly agree" as your only position; instead, explain your stance and what aspects you believe matter.

**Preview Main Points:**  
- Your essay discusses two ideas: individuals influencing governments, and individuals making personal lifestyle changes.
- Can you mention these points in your thesis for better organization?

**Confident Language:**  
- Use confident language. Instead of “I partly agree,” guide the reader with your specific viewpoint.

---

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now, using my suggestions? Try to answer the essay question directly and mention your two main points (government influence and personal lifestyles).  
Let me know your new version, and we can review it together!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:13:34.159Z

**You:** Move to the next

*Time:* 2025-11-11T04:22:09.971Z

**Assistant:** Great—let’s continue with Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision.

Please share your revised thesis statement based on my suggestions.  
(Remember to preview your two main points, be clear, and use confident language!)

When you’re ready, post your new thesis statement, and I’ll review it. If you need a prompt, you could start with something like:  
“While the actions of individuals may seem less significant than the influence of governments and companies, citizens play an important role both by influencing policy and by making environmentally friendly lifestyle choices.”

Once you give your revision, I will help you improve it further and confirm if you’re satisfied. After that, we’ll move on to Step 2!
