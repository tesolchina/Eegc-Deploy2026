            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for confirming that you want to keep the first body paragraph focused on employer demands changing, without extra clarification.

To help you finish the **thesis** and the **topic sentence** for that paragraph clearly and accurately with improved vocabulary, here’s what I suggest:

---

### Step 1: Thesis  
Try writing **one clear sentence** that says how strongly you agree and previews 2–3 reasons including the changing employer demands.  
Here’s the simple template again to guide you:

> I [degree of agreement] that AI will undermine global employment prospects because it is changing employer demands, causing a skills mismatch, and harming workers in emerging markets.

Example if you want some inspiration:

- *“I largely agree that AI will undermine global employment prospects because it is changing employer demands, creating skill mismatches for graduates, and displacing low-skill jobs in emerging markets.”*

Please post **your own version of the thesis**, using this format and clear vocabulary (use “AI,” not “Al,” etc.).

---

### Step 2: Topic Sentence for First Body Paragraph  
Once your thesis is set, try **one clear topic sentence** for the first body paragraph that links directly to the “changing employer demands” reason. You can use or adapt this template:

> Because AI is changing employer demands, workers in creative and arts industries are at greater risk of job loss or underemployment since their creative skills often do not match new AI-related technical requirements.

---

**If you want, add your attempts here for both steps, and I’ll give quick feedback to help you polish them.**

Would you like to try writing the thesis first, then the paragraph topic sentence? Or both at once?

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The essay has a clear topic (AI/automation and employment) and a recognizable viewpoint, but ideas are underdeveloped and often vague (e.g., general claims about industries disappearing without clear explanation or evidence).
- Organization: 15/25 - The draft has paragraph breaks and attempts at structure, but topic sentences are weak and logical progression is unclear; sentences sometimes jump between ideas.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Some appropriate topic words appear (automation, economies) but many terms are inconsistent or unclear (e.g., "Al" vs "AI", "EM/DM", "Development Market", "cheap labour"), reducing precision.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 14/25 - Frequent grammar, punctuation, and sentence‑formation errors (fragments, incorrect verb forms, article usage) impede clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 61/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The revised draft clarifies the central claim slightly ("I agree that would undermine...") and keeps the same reasons, but development and evidence are still limited and the degree of agreement remains unclear.
- Organization: 17/25 - Small improvements in cohesion (paragraph intent clearer), but paragraph topic sentences and transitions still need strengthening to guide the reader.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Some vocabulary improved (use of "AI" in places), and clearer expressions like "underemployment" appear; however terminology is still inconsistent and some nonstandard phrases remain ("AI automatic", "creating skills").
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 17/25 - Some sentences are clearer than in the original; errors persist (run‑ons, fragments, incorrect word order) but overall readability has modestly improved.
- **Revised Essay Total: 70/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +9 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - The main idea is slightly clearer in the revised draft and the student has focused on a specific mechanism (changing employer demands).
  - Vocabulary choices show some correction (AI appears more often; terms like "underemployment" are used).
  - The first body paragraph shows iterative revision attempts to make the claim about skill mismatch more explicit.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The thesis statement remains weak and does not clearly state the degree of agreement or provide a concise roadmap — this was not completed as requested.
  - Development and evidence: paragraphs still rely on general statements; the essay lacks concrete examples, data, or clear reasoning chains to support claims.
  - Grammar and coherence: persistent sentence‑level errors and some fragments reduce clarity; topic sentences and transitions could be stronger to improve flow.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 18**
- **Conversation Quality:** The chat shows a structured, task-oriented revision process. The AI coach provided a clear step plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph revision), diagnostic feedback, templates, and iterative guidance. The student engaged repeatedly, selected revision targets (A and D), and posted draft revisions several times. The interaction is focused and goal-directed but the student did not produce the requested final thesis.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - Evidence: 18 exchanges (within 15–25+ range). The assistant provided a multi-step plan and detailed diagnostics; the student responded multiple times and worked through iterations. Example: assistant laid out structured steps and templates multiple times (e.g., "Step 1: Revise your thesis statement...").
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - The student exercised selective acceptance and direction (e.g., choosing targets A and D; insisting "no the first part only talk about the demands changing" and "it is the first body part no need to clarify"), showing some critical judgment. However, the student did not thoroughly evaluate or justify acceptance/rejection of most AI suggestions, nor did they provide evidenceed reasons for choices.
- **Refining Process**: 4/5 - There is clear iterative revision: the student posted multiple versions of the first paragraph and responded to the assistant's templates and feedback. Evidence: repeated paragraph reposts and gradual changes in phrasing. The process was meaningful but stopped short of completing the thesis revision and a fully polished paragraph.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 13/15**

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Focus on a relevant global issue: the student consistently addresses how AI/automation affects employment — this thematic focus is appropriate for the course.
- Willingness to iterate: the student posted several revised paragraph drafts and accepted targeted feedback (e.g., shifted wording toward "graduates' skills" and "underemployment").
- Clear engagement with the AI coach's process: the student chose revision targets (A and D) and followed the assistant's stepwise prompts.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Thesis development: produce one clear, grammatically correct thesis sentence that states the degree of agreement and previews 2–3 reasons. Recommendation: use the provided template and finish Step 1 before proceeding further.
- Evidence and development: each paragraph should include at least one concrete example or clearer reasoning chain. Recommendation: add specific examples or hypothetical scenarios (e.g., a creative-design workflow automated by AI tools) and explain consequences.
- Sentence-level accuracy and cohesion: persistent grammar and punctuation errors impede communication. Recommendation: focus a revision pass on sentence correctness (subject–verb agreement, articles, removing fragments) and tighten transitions between sentences.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the essay, selected revision targets, and identified which paragraph to focus on. Evidence: chosen targets A and D, pasted paragraph text.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student accepted and worked within a clear stepwise plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph revision).
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good (Developing toward Proficient) - The student made selective decisions (e.g., limiting paragraph focus to employer demand change), but gave limited evidenceed justification for choices.
- **Independent Editing**: Developing - The student made visible edits to the paragraph but did not complete the thesis revision and still needs to apply suggested fixes more fully and independently.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Complete the thesis first and post it as one single sentence. Use a template: “I [degree of agreement] that AI will undermine global employment prospects because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].” This anchors the rest of the revision work.
2. For each body paragraph, write a precise topic sentence that links directly to the thesis, then add one concrete example or a clearer explanation (cause → effect). Example: describe a specific creative task that AI can automate and explain the labor-market consequence.
3. Do a focused grammar pass: read each sentence aloud, fix fragments and run‑ons, standardize terminology (always "AI", "emerging markets", "low‑skill or routine jobs"), and replace vague pronouns ("they") with clear nouns ("employers", "companies").

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student engaged actively with the AI coach and made iterative paragraph revisions, but did not complete the critical Step 1 (a clear thesis). Because the thesis was not finalized, further paragraph-level revisions risk lacking coherence with the overall argument.
- Recommend asking the student to submit a one-sentence thesis (as requested in the chat) and one revised paragraph with a clear topic sentence and one concrete supporting example. After those are provided, a targeted grammar and cohesion pass will likely yield substantial improvement.

        **Assistant:** Original:
It would undermine global employment prospects.Automation can replace and transforming many industries and reducing jobs 

First, the transforming industries lead to the skills and degree cannot appeal in the new industries. As the creative industries.Most of the Arts students and employees may focus in the creative skills and drawing skills.These are their professional skills.However, below the Al automation effect, more companies need employees those are good at handle Al and coding skills. They want cheaper labour and using Al to replace.Although Al cannot completely replace their jobs but the needs of the companies already changed.

Second, the transforming industries may make the traditional industries disappear more quick. The industries want to earn more money and focus in emerging market.So they may give up the traditional industries in the long term. And the traditional stakeholders may not run in the long term. Causing reduce of traditional industry jobs.

It in graph shows the EM economies a low,but some of them can compare to the DM economies. However,, the labour in there may not get jobs because the AI automation may do better than the human being. Like they mostly being cheap labour for Development Market . The jobs are highly repeat and easy to replace than the high-tech industries.In the long term, the employees in EM countries may lost of their jobs by AI automation and machines.

It seems this technological shift undermine global employment prospects in the long term as people chaning the cheap labour and high efficiency brought by Al.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-30T15:12:30.719Z

**You:** It would undermine global employment prospects.Automation can replace and transforming many industries and reducing jobs

*Time:* 2025-11-30T15:13:28.134Z

**Assistant:** Hi — I’m glad you shared your draft. Before we begin revising, let’s set clear goals so our session is focused and useful.

1) Quick goal check
- What do you most want to improve in this essay right now? (Choose or tell me one or two: clarity of thesis/argument, organization and paragraphing, evidence and development, vocabulary, grammar/sentence structure, or something else.)

2) Short diagnostic feedback (based on the rubric)
- Strengths
  - You have a clear topic: how automation/AI may affect global employment. That focus is good.
  - You attempted a logical structure with an introduction and several body paragraphs — so the essay already has the basic paragraph structure.

- Areas to improve (priority list)
  - Thesis & Argument (Content and Ideas): The thesis is unclear and doesn’t directly answer the prompt (“to what extent do you agree or disagree”). Right now it reads like a fragment and does not preview the main points or show the degree of agreement.
  - Organisation and Logical Progression: Paragraphs exist, but topic sentences are weak or missing; ideas jump around and links between sentences are often unclear. Transitions and paragraph unity need work.
  - Evidence & Development: Claims are general and undeveloped. You need clearer examples, explanation, and perhaps specific evidence (or clearer reasoning) to support your points.
  - Vocabulary: Some word choices and abbreviations (e.g., “EM,” “DM,” “Development Market,” “Al”) are unclear or inconsistent. Use standard terms (e.g., “emerging markets,” “developed markets,” “AI”) and more precise academic vocabulary.
  - Grammar & Sentence Structure: Many sentences have grammar, punctuation, and word-order problems that make meaning hard to follow (articles, verb forms, plural/singular, punctuation). This affects clarity.

3) Choose your revision targets
Which of the diagnosed issues would you like to focus on in this session? (Pick up to two—this helps us make real progress.)
Options to choose from:
- A: Clear, strong thesis/argument (required if you want to revise the thesis)
- B: Organization — topic sentence for one paragraph and paragraph unity/coherence
- C: Evidence & development — clarify or add explanation/examples
- D: Vocabulary and word choice
- E: Grammar and sentence structure

Please tell me your choices. Once you confirm, share your current thesis statement (paste it exactly as it appears) and tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (e.g., “paragraph 1 about creative industries” or paste that paragraph). Then we’ll begin Step 1 (thesis revision). Would you like to start now?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T15:13:40.921Z

**You:** A and D

*Time:* 2025-11-30T15:15:23.512Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing targets A (thesis) and D (vocabulary). That gives us a clear focus.

I see your current thesis exactly as you wrote it:
"I agree that would undermine global employment prospects.Automation can replace and transforming many industries and reducing jobs"

Quick feedback on this thesis
- It doesn’t fully answer the prompt’s “to what extent” question. It says you agree, but not how strongly or why.
- It’s two fragments joined—grammar and punctuation make it hard to read.
- It doesn’t preview the main points you will develop in the essay (so readers don’t know your roadmap).
- Vocabulary/word choice: use “AI” (consistent capitalization), “emerging markets” and “developed markets” instead of abbreviations like EM/DM here, and avoid phrasing like “cheap labour” without explanation — try “low-cost labor” or “jobs with low skill requirements.”

What the revised thesis needs to do
- Clearly state the degree of agreement (fully agree, largely agree, partly agree, disagree).
- Preview 2–3 main reasons/examples you will discuss (e.g., job losses from automation, skill mismatch, effects on emerging-market workers).
- Use one clear, grammatically correct sentence and assertive language (no “I think,” “maybe”).

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Try one sentence that:
- Directly answers the prompt (state the extent of your agreement),
- Names the two or three main reasons you will explain,
- Uses confident, precise language.

If you want a model after you try, I’ll give two short example theses to inspire you. Also, which body paragraph would you like us to work on next? (I suggest the first body paragraph about creative/arts industries — paste that paragraph or at least its topic sentence here.) Would you like to attempt the thesis revision now?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T15:15:36.885Z

**You:** I want to work on the first body part

*Time:* 2025-11-30T15:17:00.088Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. Quick confirmation before we begin:

- Targets we’ll focus on: A (clear, strong thesis) and D (vocabulary/word choice).
- You want to work on the first body paragraph (about creative/arts industries). Perfect.

I’ll ask you to revise the thesis first (Step 1). I’ll paste your current thesis exactly as you wrote it, then give very short feedback, and ask you to try a new version.

Your current thesis (exact):
"I agree that would undermine global employment prospects.Automation can replace and transforming many industries and reducing jobs"

Brief, focused feedback on this thesis
- It does not answer “to what extent” — say how strongly you agree (fully, mostly, partly).
- It’s grammatically broken (run-on/fragment). Use one clear sentence.
- It doesn’t preview your main reasons or roadmap.
- Use consistent vocabulary: write “AI” (not “Al”), “emerging markets” (not EM), and “developed markets” (not DM). Use terms like “low-skill jobs” or “jobs with routine tasks” instead of “cheap labour.”

Try now: please write one clear thesis sentence that
1) states the degree of your agreement,
2) gives 2–3 main reasons you will explain (e.g., job displacement, skill mismatch, harm to workers in emerging markets),
3) uses confident, precise language and correct vocabulary.

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? If you prefer, I can show two short example thesis sentences after you attempt one.

Also, when you’re ready, paste the first body paragraph (or at least its current topic sentence) so we can move to Step 2 once you’re happy with the thesis.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T15:17:14.354Z

**You:** start now

First, the transforming industries lead to the skills and degree cannot appeal in the new industries. As the creative industries.Most of the Arts students and employees may focus in the creative skills and drawing skills.These are their professional skills.However, below the Al automation effect, more companies need employees those are good at handle Al and coding skills. They want cheaper labour and using Al to replace.Although Al cannot completely replace their jobs but the needs of the companies already changed.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T15:20:30.854Z

**Assistant:** Nice — thanks for pasting the paragraph. Quick recap of our plan: we’re focusing on A (thesis) and D (vocabulary). First you’ll try a revised thesis (Step 1). After we agree the thesis, we’ll revise the topic sentence for this first body paragraph (Step 2), then work on the paragraph’s support (Step 3).

Step 1 — Please try a new thesis now
Write one clear sentence that:
- States how strongly you agree or disagree (e.g., “I largely agree that…”),
- Gives 2–3 reasons you will explain (e.g., job displacement, skill mismatch, impact on workers in emerging markets),
- Uses confident, precise language and correct vocabulary (use “AI,” “emerging markets,” “developed markets,” “low‑skill jobs,” etc.).

If you’d like, use this short template to start (fill the blanks):
“I [degree of agreement] that [main claim about AI and employment] because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”

Try one sentence now. If you want, I’ll give two model thesis sentences only after you try yours.

Step 2 — Quick feedback on your current paragraph and a topic-sentence guide
I won’t rewrite your sentence for you, but here are the main problems to fix and a short template to help you remake the topic sentence so it fits the new thesis:

Main problems in your current paragraph
- Vocabulary: use “AI” (not “Al”), “emerging markets” (not “Development Market”), “low‑skill jobs” or “routine jobs” (instead of “cheap labour”).
- Grammar & clarity: phrasing like “lead to the skills and degree cannot appeal in the new industries” is confusing — aim for “skills/degrees are no longer relevant” or “graduates’ skills do not match new industry needs.”
- Unity: the topic sentence should clearly say what this paragraph will argue (e.g., that creative/arts workers face a skills mismatch because AI changes employer demands).
- Precision: avoid fragments (e.g., “As the creative industries.”) — use full sentences with a clear subject and verb.

Topic-sentence template to adapt (fill the blanks):
“Because AI is changing employer demands, workers in the creative/arts industries are at risk of job loss or underemployment since their [type of skills] do not match new [technical/AI-related] requirements.”

Please try rewriting:
1) the thesis sentence now, and
2) the paragraph’s topic sentence next (after we agree the thesis).

When you post your revisions, I’ll give focused feedback and then guide you to revise the supporting sentences in that paragraph. Would you like to try the thesis now?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T15:20:46.723Z

**You:** First, the transforming industries lead to the graduates skills do not longer relevant to match new industry needs. As the creative industries.Most of the Arts students and employees may focus in the creative skills and drawing skills.These are their professional skills.However, below  AI automatic, environment is changing employer demands, workers in the creative industries are at risk of job loss or underemployment since their creating skills do not match new needs. They want cheaper labour and using Al to replace.Although Al cannot completely replace their jobs but the needs of the companies already changed.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T15:30:18.935Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a helpful draft to work from. Quick recap of our agreed targets: A (thesis) and D (vocabulary). Before we revise the paragraph, we need a stronger thesis first (Step 1). Please try the thesis task below — then we’ll move to the paragraph.

1) Very quick focused feedback on the paragraph you just pasted
- Strengths: The paragraph has a clear idea — you argue that workers in creative/arts industries face a skills mismatch because AI changes employer demands. That is a good point to develop.
- Main problems to fix now (short list):
  - Vocabulary/consistency: use “AI” (not “Al”), and “underemployment,” “low‑skill/routine jobs,” “emerging markets” where needed.
  - Grammar & clarity: many sentences are awkward or fragments (e.g., “As the creative industries.”). Fix subject–verb problems and article use (“the graduates’ skills,” not “the graduates skills”).
  - Topic sentence & unity: the paragraph needs a clear topic sentence that links to your thesis (it should say what this paragraph will show).
  - Word choice and tone: avoid vague phrases like “They want cheaper labour” — who is “they”? Use “employers prefer lower‑cost labor or AI” and explain why.
  - Repetition: avoid repeating the same idea without clear development. Add one clear example or explanation and link back to the topic sentence.

2) Topic‑sentence template you can adapt (use correct vocabulary)
Please rewrite one clear topic sentence for this paragraph using this template:
“Because AI is changing employer demands, workers in the creative and arts industries are at risk of job loss or underemployment since their creative skills often do not match new AI‑related technical requirements.”

Try to make your topic sentence one short, correct sentence that links to your thesis (it should show one reason why employment prospects are undermined).

3) Step 1: Please try a new thesis now (one sentence)
Remember the thesis must:
- State how strongly you agree or disagree with the prompt (e.g., I largely agree…),
- Preview 2–3 main reasons you will explain (e.g., job displacement, skill mismatch, harms in emerging markets),
- Use confident, precise vocabulary (AI, emerging markets, low‑skill jobs).

Use this quick template if you want:
“I [degree of agreement] that AI will undermine global employment prospects because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”

Would you like to try writing that one-sentence thesis now? After you post it, I’ll give focused feedback and then we’ll revise your paragraph’s topic sentence and supporting sentences. Would you like to try?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T15:30:31.319Z

**You:** no the first part only talk about the demands changing

*Time:* 2025-11-30T15:31:28.770Z

**Assistant:** Good — that’s clear. So for our plan:

- Confirmed targets: A (thesis) and D (vocabulary).
- Confirmed paragraph: the first body paragraph will focus only on how employer demands are changing because of AI (skill mismatch / changing required skills).

Before we revise, one quick reminder of the thesis requirements:
- State how strongly you agree or disagree.
- Preview 2–3 main reasons (make the first reason “changing employer demands” to match your paragraph).
- Use clear vocabulary: AI, emerging markets, low‑skill or routine jobs, underemployment.

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Try one sentence that follows this template (fill the blanks):

“I [degree of agreement] that AI will undermine global employment prospects because it is changing employer demands (so many workers’ skills no longer match new needs), [reason 2], and [reason 3].”

If you prefer to try the topic sentence for the first paragraph first, try this short template (focuses only on demands changing):

“Because AI is changing employer demands, workers in the creative and arts industries are at greater risk of job loss or underemployment since their creative skills often do not match new AI‑related technical requirements.”

Would you like to:
A) Try the thesis now, or
B) Try the paragraph topic sentence first?

Write your attempt here and I’ll give focused feedback. If you want a quick model after your attempt, I’ll show one or two brief examples.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T15:31:41.052Z

**You:** First, the transforming industries lead to the graduates skills do not longer relevant to match new industry needs.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T15:33:35.621Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — you’re making progress and I can see the main idea more clearly now. Quick recap: we’re focusing on A (thesis) and D (vocabulary). Before we move to the paragraph revision, we still need a single, clear thesis sentence. Please try that first.

Brief feedback on your paragraph draft (what’s strong + what to fix)
- Strength: The main idea is clearer — you argue that AI changes employer demands so creative/arts graduates’ skills may no longer match new industry needs. Good focus.
- Improvements needed (short list):
  - Vocabulary: use standard terms and consistent capitalization — write “AI” (not “Al”), “emerging markets” (not “Development Market”), and say “low‑skill jobs” or “routine jobs” rather than “cheap labour.”
  - Grammar & clarity: fix fragments and verb forms (“graduates’ skills are no longer relevant” instead of “the graduates skills do not longer relevant”). Avoid sentence fragments like “As the creative industries.”
  - Topic sentence & unity: make a clear topic sentence that directly links this paragraph to your thesis (e.g., “Because AI is changing employer demands, …”).
  - Precision: replace vague “they” with “employers” and explain why employers prefer AI/lower‑cost labor.

Step 1 — Please try a new thesis now (one sentence)
Use this short template and fill the blanks:
“I [degree of agreement] that AI will undermine global employment prospects because it [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”

Example reasons you can use: displacing routine or low‑skill jobs; causing a skills mismatch for many graduates; disproportionately harming workers in emerging markets.

Write one confident sentence now (no hedging). After you post it I’ll give focused feedback.

Step 2 (next, after thesis) — topic-sentence help for your paragraph
When you’re ready, rewrite the paragraph’s topic sentence using this template:
“Because AI is changing employer demands, workers in the creative and arts industries are at greater risk of job loss or underemployment since their creative skills often do not match new AI‑related technical requirements.”

Try to produce:
1) the thesis sentence now, and
2) the revised topic sentence for this paragraph next.

Would you like to try both now? If you prefer, I can show two short model thesis sentences after you try your own.

**You:** it is the first body part no need to clarify

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming. Noted: we’ll work on the first body paragraph and focus on A (thesis) and D (vocabulary). No need to clarify which paragraph.

Two quick, simple steps now:

1) Please write one clear thesis sentence (one sentence only). Use this short template:
“I [degree of agreement] that AI will undermine global employment prospects because it [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”
(Example reasons you can pick: displacement of routine/low‑skill jobs; a skills mismatch for many graduates; disproportionate harm to workers in emerging markets.)

2) After you post the thesis, write one revised topic sentence for the first body paragraph (one sentence). Use this template:
“Because AI is changing employer demands, workers in the creative and arts industries are at greater risk of job loss or underemployment since their creative skills often do not match new AI‑related technical requirements.”

Would you like to try both now? I’ll give focused feedback and brief suggestions after you post your attempts. If you’d prefer, I can show one or two model theses only after you try your own.
