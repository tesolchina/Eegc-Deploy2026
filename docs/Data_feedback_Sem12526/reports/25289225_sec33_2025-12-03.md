            ## Contribution Analysis

            It looks like in our chat, you requested broad revisions ("Revise thesis statement," "Revise topic sentences," "Revise one body paragraph," and "Revise the rest of the essay") but did not supply new thesis drafts, topic sentences, or paragraph content for collaborative refining. Also, the conversation repeatedly pointed out that your essay’s focus on migrant workers’ rights does not align with the course prompt about climate change actions by individuals vs. governments/corporations.

Since your revised essay (shared in the system message) is well organized, clear, and much improved in grammar and vocabulary, here are suggestions to further enhance it, reflecting the key opportunities highlighted in your assessment:

**1. Aligning with the assignment prompt**  
- Confirm whether your actual essay assignment requires addressing climate change.  
- If so, draft a new thesis statement focused on the climate-change topic, for example:  
  *“While governments and corporations play the primary role in combating climate change through policy and innovation, individual actions are also important because they raise awareness and create demand for sustainable products.”*  
- Outline body paragraphs exploring government policies, corporate supply-chain reforms, individual behavioral changes, and their interactions.

**2. Deepen content with authoritative evidence**  
- For the migrant workers’ rights essay: cite international frameworks such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Labour Organization conventions.  
- Include data or specific country case studies showing successful reforms (e.g., improvement of migrant protections via reforms to sponsorship systems, effective labor inspections, or wage-theft prosecutions).  
- Discuss economic sectors reliant on migrant labor and their measurable contributions, if possible.

**3. Expand argumentation to include counterarguments and rebuttals**  
- Address common concerns like cost issues or fears of job competition.  
- Provide evidence-based rebuttals (e.g., showing migrants add complementarity to local labor markets and contribute to long-term economic growth).  
- This will demonstrate critical thinking and balanced analysis.

**4. Lexical sophistication and discipline-specific vocabulary**  
- Incorporate precise terminology, such as “ILO conventions,” “labor inspections,” “accessible grievance mechanisms,” “sponsorship systems,” or “wage-theft prosecutions.”  
- Use academic register consistently.

**5. Engage AI collaboration more interactively**  
- To benefit more from the assistant at next steps, share your draft thesis, topic sentences, or paragraphs for targeted feedback.  
- Provide reasoning when you accept or reject AI suggestions.  
- Try drafting each element and iteratively revising it within the chat to develop your revision skills and show collaboration.

## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 16/25 - A central viewpoint exists (host countries should protect migrant workers), and the essay attempts two reasons (human rights; economic contribution). However, ideas are often unclear or underdeveloped. For example: “In my opinion, the con-countries which enguys enjuys the flexbilty tran the workers shout sets and enforces the laws to protect migrants'. rights.”
- Organization: 15/25 - Paragraphing and topic focus are unclear, with ideas jumping and limited transitions. Example: the first body paragraph mixes a historical reference with government duties without a clear topic sentence or logical development.
- Vocabulary: 14/25 - Frequent word-choice inaccuracies and misspellings impede clarity (e.g., “Cruently,” “cantries,” “seved,” “distoried,” “enguys enjuys,” “flexbilty tran”).
- Grammar: 9/25 - Major sentence-level errors significantly impede understanding (verb forms, articles, prepositions, punctuation, capitalization). Example: “After that, we It is also very important to enforce the migrants rights becouse of that migrants are the significant labors in some coutries...”
- Original Essay Total: 54/100

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 22/25 - Clear, relevant, well-developed reasoning: moral/human-rights foundation, economic contributions, and concrete enforcement actions. Clear viewpoint: “I believe that countries which benefit from migrant labor should create and carry out strong laws to protect their rights.”
- Organization: 22/25 - Strong, logical structure with clear introduction and thesis; focused body paragraphs with clear topic sentences (e.g., “First of all, even though migrant workers are not citizens…,” “Besides human rights…,” “Because migrant workers are so important…”); effective conclusion.
- Vocabulary: 21/25 - Generally precise, appropriate academic tone, and topic-relevant terms (e.g., “Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen,” “economic growth,” “innovation”). Mostly accurate, though expansion with more discipline-specific terms (e.g., ILO conventions, sponsorship systems) could add precision.
- Grammar: 22/25 - Generally accurate sentences with improved variety; minor issues are rare and do not impede understanding.
- Revised Essay Total: 87/100

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- Overall Improvement: +33 points
- Key Improvements Made:
  - Clear, concise thesis that states the claim and aligns with the essay’s focus: protection of migrant workers’ rights.
  - Strong topic sentences guiding each body paragraph’s focus (human rights, economic contribution, enforcement mechanisms).
  - Substantial sentence-level clarity and grammar accuracy, with coherent transitions and a well-formed conclusion.
- Missed Opportunities:
  - Incorporate authoritative sources and frameworks (e.g., Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ILO conventions) and add data or case studies to substantiate claims.
  - Address counterarguments (e.g., cost concerns, job competition) and provide rebuttals with evidence.
  - Align with the assigned climate-change prompt if required; the revised essay focuses on migrant workers’ rights, not climate change.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- Total Exchanges: 11
- Conversation Quality: The assistant attempted to set goals, diagnose issues, and guide a structured 3-step revision (thesis → topic sentence → body paragraph). The student responded with brief commands (“Revise thesis statement,” “Revise topic sentences,” etc.) but did not provide a thesis, topic sentence, or content for collaborative revision within the chat. The revised essay appears to have been produced outside the iterative chat workflow.

#### Interaction Scores:
- In-Depth Conversation: 2/5 - Minimal engagement with the assistant’s questions and scaffolding; student gave short commands without substantive dialogue or clarifying the topic mismatch.
- Critical Review of AI Suggestions: 1/5 - No evidence of evaluating, accepting, or rejecting AI suggestions; no justification provided.
- Refining Process: 1/5 - No iterative revision cycles documented in the chat; the structured steps (thesis, topic sentence, body paragraph) were not executed collaboratively despite prompts.
- Human-AI Interaction Total: 4/15

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear, focused thesis and coherent structure in the revised essay, with strong topic sentences and a logical progression.
- Improved language accuracy and readability; grammar and vocabulary are substantially stronger than in the original.
- Inclusion of practical recommendations (establish rules, enforcement, reporting channels) that translate principles into policy actions.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Evidence and specificity: Add credible sources, data, and case studies (e.g., ILO standards, reforms to sponsorship systems, wage-theft prosecutions, sectoral contributions) to support claims.
- Counterargument development: Acknowledge and respond to common concerns (costs, job competition) using evidence on complementary skills, long-term growth, and ethical obligations.
- Prompt alignment and collaboration: If the course prompt is climate change (individual vs. governments/corporations), draft a new thesis and outline to address that topic; use the AI assistant’s workflow to iterate.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Needs Improvement - The student did not clarify whether to address the climate-change prompt or to continue with the migrant-rights topic despite repeated assistant requests.
- Strategic Planning: Needs Improvement - The assistant offered a structured three-step process, but the student did not engage with drafting or selecting specific targets.
- Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement - No discussion of suggestions, alternatives, or rationale for choices.
- Independent Editing: Good - The revised essay shows clear, independent improvement in content, organization, and language outside the chat.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Essay writing: Strengthen argumentation with authoritative frameworks (UDHR, ILO conventions), precise terminology (e.g., labor inspections, accessible grievance mechanisms), and country-specific case evidence; add a counterargument and rebuttal section.
2. AI collaboration skills: Respond to the assistant’s setup questions (topic confirmation, priorities), share your thesis and target paragraph, and iterate; ask for targeted feedback (e.g., “Is this topic sentence focused?”) and explain why you accept or reject suggestions.
3. Overall improvement: Confirm the assignment prompt. If climate-change is required, draft a new thesis (e.g., balance of individual vs. systemic actions), outline body sections, and complete at least one revision cycle in chat to demonstrate collaborative skills.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The revised essay demonstrates strong improvement but addresses migrant workers’ rights rather than the indicated climate-change prompt flagged in the chat. Please clarify assignment alignment.
- The chat transcript does not show the student performing the three-step revision process with the AI; consider requiring at least one documented iteration (thesis → topic sentence → body paragraph) for assessing collaboration skills.
- The student’s independent revision quality is notably improved; targeted guidance on evidence integration and counterargument handling would further elevate the work.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Cruently, the problems of migrants are gaining more public attention.
Many cantries absorbs many workers from other as its own worters to enhance its industry productivity, However, in seved years, many information that about foriegn workers' rights are distoried break out.
In my opinion, the con-countries which enguys enjuys the flexbilty tran the workers shout sets and enforces the laws to protect migrants'. rights.
At first, even the migrants are not the civilization that have the identity in then countries they worked, but they also have the rights to enjey the significant rights which called person rights. At the
revolution of France, ans important document — Annauce of person's rights" painted that everyone can enjoy the basic rights which origned sa to their borned time. So, accorading to these important and authuritive documents, we can get a conclution that migrants nave the rights to enjoy the production from local goverment, and the local goverment also have the responsibility to protect migrant workers rights to snow their trendship and Kindness to outside.
After that, we It is also very important to enforce the migrants rights becouse of that migrants are the significant labors in some coutries exam the migrants bring much wealth to that countries they worked. RaIn middle-east country, espysi espycially the countries which producted oil. Many migrants workes trom India, east - Asia and middle- Asia go to here to be the workers. To be honest, themigrants from othersides trejust need a few slary and they have the more perfect skills. So the migrants help the tactory to decreose the consumption and increase their profits, which promotes the economy development in the country. Additionaly, in the Us and some european countries, mamy elites from Asia, Russia and South-America bring their knowledge and skills to there. This action helped to enhance their technology strength.

Revised:
In recent years, the problems of migrant workers have received more and more attention from the public. Many countries rely on workers from other nations to support their industries and boost productivity. However, in the past several years, we often hear news about the unfair treatment of these foreign workers. I believe that countries which benefit from migrant labor should create and carry out strong laws to protect their rights.

First of all, even though migrant workers are not citizens of the country where they work, they are still human beings with basic rights. A long time ago, during the French Revolution, an important document called the “Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen” stated that every person has certain rights simply because they are born human. This idea is still important today. Therefore, based on this principle, migrant workers should be treated fairly and protected by the local government. It is the duty of the government to show kindness and justice to people from other countries.

Besides human rights, there is another important reason to protect migrant workers: they contribute greatly to the economy. For example, in many Middle Eastern countries that produce oil, a large number of workers come from India, East Asia, and Central Asia. These workers often have useful skills and are willing to work for lower pay. This helps companies reduce costs and make more profit, which supports the country’s economic growth. Similarly, in the United States and some European countries, many highly educated professionals from Asia, Russia, and South America bring their knowledge and skills. Their work helps improve technology and innovation in these countries.

Because migrant workers are so important to the economy and because they deserve to be treated with dignity, host countries must take action. They should establish clear rules, make sure these rules are followed, and provide ways for workers to report problems. Doing this is not only fair but also good for the country’s image and long-term development.

In conclusion, protecting the rights of migrant workers is both a moral duty and a practical need. Countries that welcome these workers should treat them with respect and fairness through strong and effective laws.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

**You:** Please provide me with further suggestions for expanding the article.

*Time:* 2025-12-02T20:07:55.661Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing your draft. I’m glad to help you revise it step by step. Before we begin the three-step workflow, let’s set clear goals and diagnose the draft together.

Negotiate targets
1) What would you most like to improve today? Choose up to two:
- Clarity/Grammar (fixing sentence errors and word choice)
- Thesis & Argument (clear main point that answers the prompt)
- Organization (logical structure and topic sentences)
- Evidence & Development (strong, specific examples and explanations)
- Style/Academic tone (more formal, precise language)

Quick diagnostic feedback (based on common rubrics)
Note: There’s a mismatch between the given topic (individual vs. government/corporate actions on climate change) and your essay’s content (migrant workers’ rights). This affects task response.

- Thesis & Argument: Your central claim is difficult to understand and does not address the climate-change question. If your intention is to write about migrants’ rights, the thesis needs clearer wording and focus. If you must answer the climate-change prompt, we should realign the thesis to that topic.
- Organization: Paragraphs don’t have clear topic sentences, and ideas sometimes jump. We need a clear structure (intro with thesis → body paragraphs with focused topic sentences → conclusion).
- Evidence & Development: You try to use examples (French Revolution document; Middle East; US/Europe), which is good. However, they need to be accurate, specific, and clearly connected to your claim.
- Language Use: Many issues with spelling, grammar, vocabulary, and punctuation make meaning unclear. We can target a few recurring patterns (e.g., verb forms, articles, prepositions, capitalization, sentence boundaries).

Strengths to build on
- You show strong motivation to argue for protecting people’s rights and to explain economic contributions.
- You attempt to use historical and international examples—this is a solid habit we can refine.

Your choice: confirm the topic and select priorities
Because of the mismatch, could you please confirm:
A) Do you want to revise the essay to answer the climate-change question? or
B) Do you want to keep the current topic (migrant workers’ rights) and improve it as an independent essay?

Then, please pick up to two priorities from the list above (for example: “Thesis & Argument + Organization” or “Language + Evidence”).

Once you confirm the topic and targets, we’ll start Step 1 (Thesis Statement Revision).

If you’d like quick expansion suggestions before we choose targets, here are two brief roadmaps you can pick from:

If you choose the climate-change topic (individual vs. governments/corporations):
- Possible position: “Both are essential, but government and corporate action set the system, while individual actions amplify and demand change.”
- Body ideas to expand:
  - Policy leverage: carbon pricing, clean-energy standards, infrastructure—evidence from countries where emissions dropped after policy changes.
  - Corporate supply chains: procurement standards, Scope 3 emissions, life-cycle design—examples of companies cutting emissions.
  - Individual impact: energy use, diet, transport, voting/advocacy, social-norm effects—studies showing cumulative impact and norm cascades.
  - Interaction: how individual choices create political pressure and markets for green products, which accelerates policy and corporate shifts.
  - Counterargument + rebuttal: “Individual actions are too small” → show cumulative effects and political signaling; “Only policy matters” → show delays without social buy-in.

If you choose the migrants’ rights topic:
- Possible position: “Host countries must establish and enforce strong laws to protect migrant workers’ rights because of human-rights principles, economic contributions, and international obligations.”
- Body ideas to expand:
  - Human-rights foundation: Universal Declaration of Human Rights; ILO conventions; equal protection principles.
  - Economic contributions: sectors relying on migrants; productivity, innovation; data or case studies from specific countries.
  - Enforcement mechanisms: inspections, accessible reporting channels, penalties for violations, fair contracts, language access.
  - Case studies: reforms in a country that improved outcomes (e.g., changes to sponsorship systems; successful prosecution of wage theft).
  - Counterargument + rebuttal: concerns about costs or “job competition” → evidence on complementary skills and long-term growth.

Your turn:
1) Which topic are we working on today—climate change or migrant workers’ rights?
2) Which two priorities do you want to focus on (e.g., Thesis & Argument + Organization)?
Once you confirm, please share your current thesis (or we’ll craft one together), and we’ll begin Step 1.

*Time:* 2025-12-02T20:08:28.382Z

**You:** Revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-12-02T20:10:35.459Z

**Assistant:** Thanks for sharing your draft. I’m happy to guide you through a clear, step-by-step revision. Before we start the three-step workflow, let’s quickly set targets and diagnose the essay so we focus on what will help you most.

Negotiate targets
What would you most like to improve today? Please choose up to two:
- Clarity/Grammar (fixing sentence errors and word choice)
- Thesis & Argument (clear main point that answers the prompt)
- Organization (logical structure and topic sentences)
- Evidence & Development (specific, accurate examples and explanation)
- Style/Academic tone (more formal, precise language)

Diagnostic feedback (brief and clear)
Note: Your essay discusses migrant workers’ rights, but the given prompt is about climate change (individual vs. government/corporate actions). This mismatch affects task response.

- Thesis & Argument: The main claim is hard to understand and does not answer the climate-change question. If you want to write about migrants’ rights, the thesis should be clarified and focused. If you need to answer the climate prompt, we should realign your thesis to that topic.
- Organization: Topic sentences are unclear, and ideas jump. We need a clear structure: introduction with a strong thesis → body paragraphs with focused topic sentences → conclusion.
- Evidence & Development: You try to use examples (French Revolution, Middle East, US/Europe). Good instinct, but they need to be accurate, specific, and clearly connected to your claim.
- Language Use: Frequent grammar/spelling/vocabulary errors make meaning unclear. We can target common patterns (verb forms, articles, prepositions, sentence boundaries).

Strengths to build on
- You care about rights and contributions—strong motivation.
- You already reach for historical and international examples—great habit we can refine.

Your choice: confirm the topic and select priorities
Please let me know:
1) Which topic are we working on today?
   - A) The climate-change prompt (individual vs. governments/corporations)
   - B) Migrant workers’ rights (keep your current topic and improve it)
2) Which two priorities do you want to focus on (e.g., Thesis & Argument + Organization)?
3) Share your current thesis sentence (one sentence that states your main point). If you’re unsure, I can give you a simple frame to fill in.

Once you confirm, we’ll start Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision.

If you’d like a quick frame to help you think, here are two optional thesis frames (you can adapt them to your position):

- Climate-change topic frame:
  “While __________ are crucial for setting systemic change, __________ also matter because __________; together, they __________.”

- Migrant-rights topic frame:
  “Host countries must __________ to protect migrant workers’ rights because __________, __________, and __________.”

Your turn: choose the topic, pick two priorities, and paste your current thesis. Then we’ll refine it together. Would you like to try drafting your thesis now?
