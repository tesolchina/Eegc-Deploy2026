## Complete Conversation
**Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Although government actions may seem more significant than individuals’ lifestyle choices, the latter can still make a meaningful contribution to addressing climate change. For instance, recycling or reducing energy use can influence others and encourage firms to offer more sustainable products. If a large number of customers prefer sustainable products, companies are likely to modify their business practices to attract these buyers and increase their profit. However, not everyone is willing to change their habits, which limits the overall effectiveness of individual actions. If only a small number of people adopt sustainable behaviors, the impact may not be sufficient to address the climate crisis.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-04T14:57:34.379Z

**You:** Individual still have a role to play in climate change . Like influencing the government and politicians ; make small changes in their own lives

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:01:32.439Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let's begin with **Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision**.

**Please share your current thesis statement.**  
I see some attempts in your draft, such as:

> "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

or

> "Individual still have a role to play in climate change. Like influencing the government and politicians; make small changes in their own lives."

Let me know which sentence you want to use as your thesis, or if you want to write a new one based on your ideas. Then I’ll give you feedback and guide you to make it as clear and strong as possible!

**Could you confirm your thesis statement, or type the version you want to revise?**

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:01:35.699Z

**You:** Individual still have a role to play in climate change. Like influencing the government and politicians; make small changes in their own lives.

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:03:38.579Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement:

> Individual still have a role to play in climate change. Like influencing the government and politicians; make small changes in their own lives.

Here’s some feedback to help you strengthen it:

**Clarity & Structure**
- The sentence is a bit fragmented; it’s split into two parts that could be combined into one.
- Try to avoid using “Like…” as a separate sentence—combine your main ideas together.

**Focus**
- Make sure your thesis clearly previews both main points: (a) influencing government and (b) personal lifestyle changes.

**Language**
- Use confident, precise language. Make sure your thesis directly answers the essay topic (Do individuals matter vs. governments/companies?).
- Try to avoid “Individual” (use “Individuals”), and phrase the thesis as a clear statement, not a suggestion.

**Example Model (for inspiration—not for direct copying):**
> Individuals play an important role in addressing climate change by influencing government decisions and by making environmentally-friendly choices in their daily lives.

Would you like to try revising your thesis now, using this feedback? Give it a try, and I’ll help you polish it further!

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:03:43.506Z

**You:** Although individuals have a smaller impact on global warming issue, they can also play an important role in addressing climate change by influencing government decisions and by making environmentally-friendly choices in their daily lives.

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:09:59.794Z

**Assistant:** Great effort! Your revised thesis is much clearer and more confident. Let's look at it together:

> Although individuals have a smaller impact on global warming issue, they can also play an important role in addressing climate change by influencing government decisions and by making environmentally-friendly choices in their daily lives.

Here are some suggestions to make it even stronger:

**1. Clarity & Focus**
- Try to avoid saying "smaller impact on global warming issue"—it's clearer to use "climate change" as your main term.
- "Can also play" is a bit tentative; let's be firm and direct.
- The thesis could answer the essay question directly: Do individuals matter compared to governments and companies?

**2. Language & Structure**
- Use parallel structure: “by influencing government decisions and making environmentally friendly choices.”
- “Although individuals have less impact than governments and companies, …”
- Try: "Individuals, although less influential than governments and companies, still play a vital role in fighting climate change by..."

**Would you like to try revising your thesis again, with these tips in mind?**  
If you want, you can use this model sentence for guidance (but put it in your own words):

- Individuals, although less influential than governments and companies, still play a vital role in fighting climate change by influencing government decisions and making environmentally friendly lifestyle choices.

Let me know your new version! We'll make sure you're happy with it before moving to Step 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:10:05.706Z

**You:** Final version :Do individuals matter compared to governments and companies? Individuals, although less influential than governments and companies, still play a vital role in fighting climate change by influencing government decisions and making environmentally friendly lifestyle choices.

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:12:28.978Z

**Assistant:** Excellent work! Your revised thesis is clear, focused, and directly responds to the essay question. It also previews your two main points logically. Well done! 👍

Before we move on, **are you satisfied with this thesis statement, or would you like to make any more changes?**  
If you’re happy, we’ll continue to Step 2.

---

**Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision**

Now, please choose one body paragraph you would like to revise:  
- The first body paragraph (about influencing government)
- OR the second body paragraph (about making personal green choices)

Which paragraph would you like to work on?  
Once you choose, please copy that paragraph’s current topic sentence here so we can review and improve it together!

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:12:32.664Z

**You:** second body paragraph (about making personal green choices) second body paragraph (about making personal green choices) that paragraph’s current topic sentence here so we can review and improve it together: On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter.

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:14:42.387Z

**Assistant:** Great! Thank you for sharing the topic sentence from your second body paragraph:

> "On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter."

Let’s work on making this topic sentence **connect clearly to your revised thesis statement.**

### Feedback:

**1. Focus**
- The topic sentence should summarize the main idea of this paragraph: how personal choices can help address climate change.
- It should connect logically to your thesis's second main point: "making environmentally friendly lifestyle choices."

**2. Clarity & Conciseness**
- Avoid long lists in the topic sentence (save examples for later in the paragraph).
- Be direct and confident.

**3. Structure**
- You can briefly contrast the smaller impact with the importance of individual choices.

---

**Tips for Revision:**
- State clearly that individual lifestyle choices, though less impactful than government actions, are still significant in fighting climate change.

**For inspiration (not for copying), here are two model topic sentences:**

- Even though personal lifestyle changes may seem less significant than government policies, individuals’ actions still play an important part in addressing climate change.
- Individual efforts to live more sustainably, while smaller in scale than government action, are still crucial in reducing environmental harm.

---

**Would you like to try rewriting your topic sentence now, using these suggestions?**  
Type your new version, and I’ll give feedback before we revise the rest of the paragraph!

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:14:47.219Z

**You:** Individuals’ lifestyle maybe less significant than the government, but their action still take a big steps on climate change

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:18:38.407Z

**Assistant:** Good job drafting your revised topic sentence! Here’s some feedback and guidance:

---

**Strengths**  
- You contrast individual and government impact, which is good.
- You clearly state that individual action is important for climate change.

**Suggestions for Improvement**  
1. **Grammar & Precision**  
   - Try to use plural “actions” instead of “action.”
   - “Take a big steps” is a bit unclear – maybe “make a meaningful difference” or “can contribute meaningfully.”
   - Be careful with “maybe less significant than the government”—make it “less significant than government actions” or “government policies.”
   - Make your sentence more confident (avoid “maybe”).

2. **Clarity**  
   - Be concise and specific.
   - Connect more clearly to your thesis idea: “making environmentally friendly lifestyle choices.”

---

**Would you like to try revising it again** with these tips?  
For inspiration (don’t copy!):

- “While individual lifestyle choices may not seem as significant as government action, they can still contribute meaningfully to the fight against climate change.”

Try to rewrite your topic sentence and I’ll help you polish it further!

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:18:42.847Z

**You:** Final draft :   individuals’ life choice may seems less significant than government actions ,but they can still make a significant contribution to climate change.

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:24:57.338Z

**Assistant:** Excellent effort! Your revised topic sentence is much stronger, with a clear comparison and confident language. Let's refine it just a bit more for grammar and clarity.

**Feedback:**

1. **Grammar**
   - Change "individuals’ life choice may seems" to "individuals’ lifestyle choices may seem"
   - Add "the" before "government actions" is optional, but "government actions" is better than "the government actions."
   - Instead of "make a significant contribution to climate change," use "make a significant contribution in addressing climate change" for clarity.

2. **Formal, Academic Tone**
   - Use "while" or "although" for a smooth contrast.
   - Make sure subject and verb agreement is correct.

**Possible revision for inspiration (please reword as you like):**
> Although individuals’ lifestyle choices may seem less significant than government actions, they can still make an important contribution to addressing climate change.

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence one more time using these tips?**  
Once you're happy, we'll move on to revising the rest of your paragraph!

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:25:02.360Z

**You:** Final draft : While the government actions may seems more significant than individuals’ lifestyle choices , they can still make a significant contribution in addressing climate change

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:27:48.318Z

**Assistant:** **Great job! Your revised topic sentence is almost perfect. Let's make a couple of tweaks to correct grammar and improve flow—then you'll have a really strong, academic sentence.**

**Current version:**  
While the government actions may seems more significant than individuals’ lifestyle choices , they can still make a significant contribution in addressing climate change

**Suggestions:**
- Change "the government actions" to "government actions" (no need for "the").
- "May seems" should be "may seem."
- There should be no space before the comma.
- To make the subject clear, start with "Although government actions may seem more significant than individuals’ lifestyle choices..." (so "they" clearly refers to "individuals’ lifestyle choices").

**Final, polished version (as a model):**  
Although government actions may seem more significant than individuals’ lifestyle choices, the latter can still make a meaningful contribution to addressing climate change.

**Would you like to use this version, or try making one more revision yourself?**  
If you’re happy, we’ll move to Step 3 and revise the rest of the paragraph for unity and clarity!

---

### Step 3 — Revising the Rest of the Chosen Paragraph

Let’s now look at your supporting sentences. Here is your paragraph as originally written (excluding the old topic sentence):

> These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

**Let’s use your new topic sentence and revise the rest of the paragraph, focusing on:**
- Directly supporting your revised topic sentence.
- Logical flow from idea to idea.
- Smoother transitions and more academic vocabulary.
- Explanation of both the strengths and the challenges of individual action.

---

#### **Guiding Questions for You:**

1. **Unity & Support:**  
    - Do all your sentences clearly explain or give examples of how individual choices "make a meaningful contribution" to climate change?
    - Can you add a little more explanation about *why* individual choices matter even if they are small?

2. **Evidence & Explanation:**  
    - Is your example (people buying green products) clear and specific?
    - Would adding a recent example (perhaps one country or campaign) help?

3. **Clarity & Flow:**  
    - Are the limitations (that not everyone acts) explained clearly?
    - Can you connect these limitations back to your topic sentence (i.e., actions are helpful but not enough on their own)?

---

**Let’s try revising one supporting sentence at a time.**  
Start by rewriting this section:  
> These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products.

**Would you like to try rewriting these sentences now?**  
If you want, try combining them or clarifying your explanation. I’ll review and help you build the rest of the paragraph step by step!

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:27:56.960Z

**You:** No thank you

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:28:12.919Z

**Assistant:** No problem! If you would like to stop here, that’s perfectly fine—your work on revising the thesis statement and topic sentence was excellent. 😊

If you ever want to continue with revising the rest of your paragraph, just let me know. Here’s a summary of what you’ve accomplished so far:

**What You’ve Improved:**  
- Your thesis statement is now clear, confident, and directly answers the essay question.
- Your topic sentence for the selected paragraph is now logically connected to the thesis and uses academic language.

These are important steps toward a well-structured and persuasive essay.  
Just remember: clear structure and strong main ideas are the keys to higher grades in academic writing!

If you have any other writing questions, or need help with different parts of your essay in the future, feel free to ask.

**Keep up the great work!** 🌟

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:28:16.209Z

**You:** Go to step 3 my corrected answer:Although government actions may seem more significant than individuals’ lifestyle choices, the latter can still make a meaningful contribution to addressing climate change.

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:35:14.427Z

**Assistant:** Excellent—your topic sentence is clear, academic, and logically connects to your thesis. Well done! 🌟

**Now let’s move on to Step 3: Revising the rest of your chosen paragraph for unity, clarity, and coherence.**

### Original Supporting Sentences:
> These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

---

### Step-by-step Revision

#### 1. **Let’s start with the first two sentences:**
> These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can you combine these ideas for smoother flow?
- Can you explain *why* these actions, if done by many, "still matter" for climate change?
- Can you use a more academic phrase like "influence" or "encourage" instead of "send a message"?

**Would you like to try rewriting these sentences now?**  
You can focus your revision on:
- Explaining that individual choices, when adopted by many, influence others and businesses.
- Showing the positive effect with clearer vocabulary.

**For example—but put it in your own words:**
> When many individuals adopt environmentally friendly habits, such as recycling or reducing energy use, their actions can influence others and encourage companies to offer more sustainable products.

---

**Go ahead and try to revise those sentences now! I’ll check your version and help you build the rest.**

---

If you want to work one sentence at a time, here’s a possible approach:

1. Rewrite the idea that personal choices matter, especially when practiced by many people.
2. Clarify how these choices can influence society and companies.

**You:** Although government actions may seem more significant than individuals’ lifestyle choices, the latter can still make a meaningful contribution to addressing climate change. For instance recycling or reducing energy use can influence others and encourage firms to offer more sustainable products.

**Assistant:** Excellent progress! 🙌 Your revised topic sentence and supporting sentence are much clearer and more academic. You’ve improved coherence and focus—great job!

Let’s now continue step-by-step with the rest of the paragraph, aiming for unity and logical flow. I’ll ask you guiding questions for each sentence so you can strengthen your ideas and vocabulary.

---

### Current version:
> Although government actions may seem more significant than individuals’ lifestyle choices, the latter can still make a meaningful contribution to addressing climate change. For instance, recycling or reducing energy use can influence others and encourage firms to offer more sustainable products.

---

#### **Next supporting idea in your original draft:**
> For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does this sentence clearly expand on how individuals can influence businesses?
- Can you use more precise, formal vocabulary (e.g., “if many consumers choose eco-friendly products, companies may respond…”)?
- Would mentioning a real example (like switching to reusable bags in supermarkets) help?

**Would you like to try rewriting this next sentence, focusing on:**  
- Clearly linking consumer choices to business changes.
- Using confident, academic phrasing.

**For inspiration—put it in your style, not just copying:**  
> If a large number of consumers prefer environmentally friendly products, companies are likely to adapt their policies to meet this demand and increase their profits.

**You:** If a massive amount of customers prefers sustainable products, companies will shift their  policies to meet market demands and increase revenue

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:43:38.154Z

**Assistant:** That’s a great revision! You’ve made some strong improvements in vocabulary and clarity. Let’s review and polish it a bit more:

### What you did well:
- Used “a massive amount of customers prefers sustainable products,” which shows the cause.
- Explained the effect: “companies will shift their policies to meet market demands and increase revenue.”
- Used more precise and academic language than before.

### Suggestions for further improvement:
- Instead of “a massive amount of customers,” it’s more natural to say “a large number of customers” or “if many customers.”
- “Prefers” should agree with “customers” (so: "prefer" not "prefers").
- Consider briefly specifying what kind of policy changes (e.g., “environmental policies” or “business practices”).
- You might add a phrase to show the positive impact on the environment.

#### Here is a possible way to combine these tips (in your style!):
If a large number of customers prefer sustainable products, companies are likely to change their business practices to attract these buyers and increase their revenue.

Once you confirm or update this sentence, we can work on the next supporting idea in your paragraph! You’re doing an excellent job of building a logical and unified argument. 🌱

**You:** If a large number of customers prefer sustainable products, companies are likely to modify their business practices to attract these buyers and increase their profit .

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:44:53.898Z

**Assistant:** Excellent revision! Your new sentence is clear, academic, and closely connected to your topic sentence. You’ve used strong vocabulary (“modify their business practices,” “attract these buyers,” “increase their profit”) and correct grammar. Well done! 🌟

**Let’s move on to the next part of your paragraph.**

Here’s your next supporting idea from the original draft:
> But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does this limitation relate clearly back to the topic sentence?
- Is the challenge of low participation explained in academic language?
- Can you strengthen your transitions (e.g., “However,” “Nevertheless”)?
- Could you clarify why low participation makes it difficult for individual actions to create large impact?

**Try revising these two sentences for:**
- Academic vocabulary and tone
- Smoother connection to the previous ideas
- Clear explanation of why individual actions are sometimes limited

**For inspiration (but use your own words):**
> However, not everyone is willing to change their habits, which limits the overall effectiveness of individual actions. If only a small number of people adopt sustainable behaviors, the impact may not be sufficient to address the climate crisis.

**You:** How many steps here

*Time:* 2025-11-04T15:46:06.094Z

**Assistant:** Great question! The revision process I guided you through is **divided into three structured steps**, which help focus your essay revisions in a clear, manageable way. Here they are:

---

## **Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision**
- **Goal:** Make your thesis clear, strong, and directly answer the essay question.
- **Process:**  
  1. Share your original thesis statement.
  2. Get feedback focused on clarity, strength, focus, and language.
  3. Rewrite your thesis, revise further if needed, and confirm you are satisfied.

---

## **Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision (for one selected body paragraph)**
- **Goal:** Make the topic sentence of your chosen body paragraph clearly connect to and support your revised thesis.
- **Process:**  
  1. Choose which body paragraph to work on.
  2. Share the paragraph’s current topic sentence.
  3. Get feedback on its connection to the thesis, clarity, and focus.
  4. Revise the topic sentence (with examples and guidance if needed) and confirm you are satisfied.

---

## **Step 3 — Revising the Rest of the Chosen Paragraph**
- **Goal:** Adjust the supporting sentences so they fully support the new topic sentence—improving clarity, unity, coherence, and evidence.
- **Process:**  
  1. Examine the rest of the chosen paragraph, one section at a time.
  2. Use guiding questions and feedback to revise each sentence for logical flow, academic vocabulary, and support.
  3. Build the paragraph step-by-step until it is unified and clearly supports the topic sentence and thesis.

---

**Summary:**  
> **There are 3 main steps in this revision process.**

Each step builds on the previous one: thesis → topic sentence → paragraph body/support.  
This method helps you focus your improvements and track your progress clearly!

**Assistant:** Certainly! Here is a **summary of all your answers and progress** throughout our structured revision process:

---

## **Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision**

- **Your original thesis** was fragmented and tentative.
    - Example: “Individual still have a role to play in climate change. Like influencing the government and politicians; make small changes in their own lives.”

- **Feedback provided:**
    - Combine ideas into one clear, direct statement.
    - Preview both main arguments (“influencing government” and “personal choices”).
    - Use confident, academic language.

- **You revised your thesis several times.** With guidance on grammar, clarity, and academic tone, you produced:
    - Final version:  
      **“Although government actions may seem more significant than individuals’ lifestyle choices, the latter can still make a meaningful contribution to addressing climate change.”**
    - This thesis is clear, confident, and previews your essay structure.

---

## **Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision (Second Body Paragraph)**

- **Paragraph selected:** Second body paragraph (about personal green choices).

- **Original topic sentence:**  
    - “On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter.”

- **Feedback provided:**
    - Avoid lists in topic sentences; state the main idea instead.
    - Connect logically and confidently to the thesis.
    - Use academic language (“contribute,” “addressing climate change,” “lifestyle choices”).

- **You revised and improved your topic sentence:**  
    - Final version:  
      **“Although government actions may seem more significant than individuals’ lifestyle choices, the latter can still make a meaningful contribution to addressing climate change.”**
    - This clearly links the paragraph to the thesis and sets the main idea.

---

## **Step 3 — Revising the Rest of the Chosen Paragraph**

- **We worked step-by-step through the supporting sentences:**
    - Original:  
        > “These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.”
    - Guidance included:
        - Combine ideas for smoother transitions.
        - Replace informal phrases with academic vocabulary.
        - Clarify cause and effect.
        - Elaborate both positive impacts and real-world limitations.

- **Your revised supporting sentences:**
    - Example of improvement:  
      > “For instance, recycling or reducing energy use can influence others and encourage firms to offer more sustainable products.”
    - Improved consumer-business connection:  
      > “If a large number of customers prefer sustainable products, companies are likely to modify their business practices to attract these buyers and increase their profit.”
    - Clear, academic explanation of limitations:  
      > “However, not everyone is willing to change their habits, which limits the overall effectiveness of individual actions. If only a small number of people adopt sustainable behaviors, the impact may not be sufficient to address the climate crisis.”

---

## **Summary of the Revision Steps**

- **Step 1:** Revise the thesis statement—make it clear, confident, and preview main points.
- **Step 2:** Revise the topic sentence of one body paragraph—connect it to the thesis, state the paragraph’s main idea clearly.
- **Step 3:** Revise the rest of that paragraph—ensure supporting sentences are logical, coherent, and use academic vocabulary; address both positive impacts and limitations.

---

## **What You Improved:**

- **Thesis statement:** Now academic, direct, and previews your arguments.
- **Topic sentence:** Now closely connected to the thesis and sets a clear direction for the paragraph.
