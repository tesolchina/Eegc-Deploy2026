            ## Contribution Analysis

            It looks like you engaged well by asking focused questions about your essay’s paragraphs, grammar, topic sentences, and conclusion. However, based on your chat history and the final assessment, here’s a summary and some tailored advice for moving forward:

---

### Summary of Your Current Essay & Interaction

- Your essay has a clear topic and some good ideas about how automation affects global employment through productivity and new job creation.
- However, the essay needs improvements in:
  - **Thesis clarity and language accuracy**
  - **Paragraph coherence and effective transitions**
  - **Grammar (subject-verb agreement, articles, plurals, sentence completeness)**
  - **Vocabulary accuracy and phrasing**
  - **Conclusion conciseness and strength**

- In your conversations with the AI, you asked thoughtful questions **about** improving these areas but did not submit any revised thesis, topic sentences, or paragraphs.
- This means your revised essay remains the same as the original draft, missing the opportunity to apply feedback and improve.

---

### Key Recommendations to Help You Move Forward

1. **Practice Actively Revising Your Writing**

   When the AI asks you to try rewriting a thesis, topic sentence, or paragraph:

   - Take a moment to write your own version—even rough drafts help.
   - Share those revisions back to get focused feedback.
   - This process is essential: revision isn’t just about understanding feedback, but **applying it**.

2. **Focus On One Issue at a Time**

   For example, start by rewriting your thesis statement clearly and correctly. Use the AI’s suggestions:
   - “Automation is transforming global employment by increasing productivity and creating new job opportunities.”
   
   Then move to the next step after you revise and are confident.

3. **Use Simple, Clear Sentences**

   To improve grammar and clarity:
   - Write short, complete sentences.
   - Check subject-verb agreement.
   - Use articles (“a,” “the”) carefully.
   - Avoid run-on sentences or fragments.
   
   Example rewriting given to you:

   > "Automation helps simplify complicated processes in different jobs. This makes it easier for employees to do their work."

4. **Revise Paragraph Structure Using Transitions**

   Connect your ideas clearly:

   - Use transition words: “For example,” “Additionally,” “Furthermore,” “In contrast,” etc.
   - Each sentence should build on the previous one.
   - Make sure every example supports your main point and links back to the thesis.

5. **Strengthen Your Conclusion**

   Summarize main points clearly and add a final insight:

   > “Overall, automation is changing global employment by increasing productivity and creating new jobs. To benefit from these changes, workers must adapt and develop new skills.”

6. **Engage in the Revision Workflow**

   The AI’s suggested step-by-step helps you focus:

   - First, revise your thesis.
   - Next, rewrite the topic sentence of a paragraph.
   - Finally, revise that entire paragraph for clarity and grammar.
   
   Sharing updated drafts after each step lets the AI help you improve iteratively.

### How to Get Started Right Now

**Pick one – and try writing a revision following the guidance:**

- Your **thesis statement** (the main argument of the essay).
- OR your **topic sentence** for the productivity paragraph.
- OR a problematic sentence you want to fix for grammar.

Paste your attempt here, and I’ll help you refine it further!

### Final Note

Revision is a skill that grows with practice. Using AI as an editor works best when you actively try the edits yourself, then seek feedback. Remember: thoughtful questions plus active rewriting = clear progress.

If you want, I can give you a sample revised thesis or paragraph to model your writing on—just say the word!

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- **Content and Ideas:** 17/25 - The essay demonstrates basic awareness of how technology (automation) affects global employment prospects, mentioning productivity and new job opportunities. However, ideas are sometimes unclear (e.g., “renological shift” likely meant “technological shift”), and argument depth is limited.
- **Organization:** 16/25 - There is a simple structure (introduction, body, conclusion) and paragraphing, but organization within paragraphs suffers from weak topic sentences, poor transitions, and logical gaps.
- **Vocabulary:** 15/25 - Some appropriate academic vocabulary is attempted (“automation,” “employment prospect”), but there are significant misuses (“renological,” “crective idea”), awkward phrasing, and repetition.
- **Grammar:** 14/25 - Frequent errors in verb tense, agreement, article use, plurals, punctuation, and some sentence fragments reduce clarity throughout.
- **Original Essay Total:** 62/100

#### Revised Essay Scores:
*The revised essay is substantively identical to the original, indicating no meaningful revision occurred in thesis, topic sentence, or paragraph content.*
- **Content and Ideas:** 17/25 - No significant changes; strengths and weaknesses are the same.
- **Organization:** 16/25 - Organization remains unchanged; transitions and paragraph logic are not improved.
- **Vocabulary:** 15/25 - Vocabulary errors and word misuse persist.
- **Grammar:** 14/25 - All major grammar issues remain.
- **Revised Essay Total:** 62/100

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement:** +0 points
- **Key Improvements Made:** None; the revision did not address key components (thesis statement, topic sentence, or body paragraph).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Revision of thesis statement for clarity, focus, and proper language.
  - Stronger topic sentences and transitions for paragraph coherence.
  - Correction of repeated grammar and vocabulary errors.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

    - *Evidence:* Student requests included "How can it be improved in paragraph (coherence, flow)", "How about paragraph structure on point 1", "How to improve my grammar mistakes".
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions:** 2/5 – The student read and considered detailed feedback but did not respond to prompts for revision, justification, or decision-making (e.g., no revised thesis/topics submitted).
    - *Evidence:* The AI repeatedly invited the student to try rewriting parts, but the student did not attempt or reflect on proposed changes.
- **Refining Process:** 1/5 – There was no actual revision or iterative refinement process evident. The workflow outlined by the AI (thesis revision → topic sentence → body paragraph) was not executed.
    - *Evidence:* The revised essay remains identical to the original; no substantive changes made in any required areas.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total:** 6/15

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- **Willingness to Diagnose:** The student proactively requested feedback on several core issues (coherence, paragraph structure, grammar, conclusion).
- **Engagement with Feedback:** The student read and prompted multiple rounds of diagnostic advice, showing a willingness to learn about weaknesses.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- **Active Revision:** The student did not attempt any actual revision (thesis, topic sentence, or body paragraph), missing the main goal.
- **Critical Interaction:** The student should respond to AI prompts by rewriting sentences, reflecting on suggestions, or at least deciding on preferred changes.
- **Iterative Process:** There was no evidence of revision cycles or step-by-step improvement.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision:** Good – Student provided context about areas of concern (paragraphs, grammar, conclusion).
- **Strategic Planning:** Satisfactory – Student participated in goal-setting conversation but did not follow through with concrete revision steps.
- **Critical Evaluation:** Needs Improvement – Student did not evaluate or apply AI suggestions, nor attempt justification for any choices.
- **Independent Editing:** Needs Improvement – No evidence of editing, reflection, or independent revision.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing Skills:** Practice actual revision by rewriting thesis statements, topic sentences, and full paragraphs; pay special attention to grammar and logical connections using the AI’s feedback.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills:** Actively engage in the workflow by responding to prompts with your own revised sentences or paragraphs, and provide reasoning for your choices.
3. **Overall Improvement:** Develop a habit of drafting, reviewing, and revising; treat the AI as a collaborative editor, not just a diagnostic tool—use its guidance to directly improve your work.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student showed engagement and curiosity in diagnostic feedback but did not execute any of the required revision tasks (thesis, topic sentence, body paragraph revision).
- Intervention may be needed to coach student through the process of taking action on revision prompts and submitting actual changes for feedback. Consider follow-up to ensure students understand that revision is an active process, not just diagnostic review.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-20T07:49:35.903Z

**You:** How can it be improved in paragraph ( coherence, flow )

*Time:* 2025-11-20T08:26:35.822Z

**Assistant:** Great questions! Before we start our structured three-step revision workflow, let’s follow the preliminary stage. This ensures the feedback we work on matches your personal goals and your essay’s needs.

---

**Negotiating Targets**

First, can you tell me more about your personal goals for this essay?  
For example, what do you want to focus on improving most:  
- Clarity (making your main ideas easy to understand)?  
- Argument strength (how convincing your essay is)?  
- Structure & flow (organization, logical connections, smooth transitions)?  
- Grammar (sentence correctness and accuracy)?  
- Vocabulary or style (word choice, academic/formal language)?

Or is there something else you’re especially keen to work on?

---

**Diagnostic Feedback Based on Rubric**

Here’s a quick diagnosis of your current draft, using the key rubrics you mentioned:

- **Paragraph Structure (Coherence & Flow):**  
  - **Strengths:** Your ideas are presented in a logical order: start with productivity, then job opportunities.
  - **Needs Improvement:**  
    - Transitions between ideas are sometimes missing or unclear.
    - Some topic sentences are vague or not directly related to the thesis.
    - Sentences sometimes jump from idea to idea without clear connections, affecting coherence.

- **Sentence Construction (Grammar & Variety):**  
  - **Strengths:** You use some academic language and give examples.
  - **Needs Improvement:** There are frequent grammar mistakes (e.g. verb agreement, missing words, awkward phrasing) which makes some parts confusing.

- **Vocabulary Naturalness (Appropriateness & Precision):**  
  - **Strengths:** You use some specific vocabulary (e.g. “automation”, “employment prospect”).
  - **Needs Improvement:** Sometimes vocabulary is not precise (“prospect”, “aspect”, “creative idea,” etc.), and there are some repeated or misused terms.

---

**Student Priority Selection**

Based on the feedback above, what do you want to focus on today for this revision?  
- One suggestion: since you asked specifically about **coherence and flow in your paragraph**, we can make that the main goal for this session.
- Would you also like us to work on grammar and sentence structure as a secondary target, or keep our main focus just on coherence and flow?

Please confirm your preferences before we begin with **Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**.

---

**Your turn:**  
- What are your main targets for today’s revision (from the issues above)?  
- Would you like to add or change anything about the plan so far?  

Let me know! Once you confirm, we’ll start with your thesis statement together.

*Time:* 2025-11-20T08:26:48.548Z

**You:** my thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-20T08:27:20.930Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for confirming you want to start with your thesis statement!  
Just to make sure: based on your earlier message, our main revision target for today will be **coherence and flow in your paragraph**, and we’ll also pay attention to **grammar and sentence construction** as a secondary target. Does this match your priorities? If you want to adjust this, just let me know!

---

**Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**

Here’s your current thesis statement as it appears in your draft:

> The rennological shift ultimately enhance global employment prospect.Not only can it profoundly boost productivity , but also to discover new job opportunities across technological aspect in Automation. The Transformation has led to an innovative prospect for employment .

**Feedback on your Thesis Statement:**
- **Clarity:** The main idea (“renological shift”/automation improves global employment prospects) is somewhat clear, but the phrasing is confusing.
- **Focus:** It’s a bit broad; it’s not specific about what new job opportunities or increased productivity.
- **Language:** There are grammatical errors (“enhance” should be “enhances”, missing articles, and awkward phrases).
- **Preview of Main Points:** It hints at productivity and new job opportunities, which is good.

**Guiding questions for your revision:**
- What is the “renological shift”? Did you mean "technological shift" or "automation"?
- Can you rewrite the thesis so it clearly states that automation improves global employment by boosting productivity and creating new job opportunities?
- Try to be concise, confident, and avoid hedging language like “may” or “maybe.”  
- Tip: The thesis should answer the essay question and preview your main argument points.

**Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now?**  
If you prefer, you can write your revised thesis below, or ask for a model sentence to get started! 

Let’s work on this together—once you provide your revision, I’ll give you further feedback and help you refine it.

*Time:* 2025-11-20T08:27:27.167Z

**You:** how about paragraph structure on point 1 , how is the flow and coherence

*Time:* 2025-11-20T08:30:55.100Z

**Assistant:** Great follow-up question! Let’s do a focused diagnosis on the **flow and coherence** of your **first body paragraph** (the one about productivity), based on your current draft.

---

## **Paragraph 1: Original Draft**

> To begin with, the most significant benefit is the boosting in productivity. The automation helps simplify the complicated progress in different jobs.This make employee to deal with their work more easily For instance. a data analyser can use Automation to summarise and sum up all of the messy  data. This reduce the time allocation for tidying up the data in a more convenient way. Additionally. in creative industries. Employees can use automation to design some of  the crective idea for their future. this boost their quality and efficiency to perform well in work and helps to avoid unemployment in long term.In view of this,Automation has contributes to create better working environment globally.

---

## **Diagnosis: Flow & Coherence of First Paragraph**

**Strengths:**
- **Logical Order:** You start with the main idea (productivity), then give examples (data analyser, creative industries), and finally mention the impact (better work environment).
- **Attempts at explanation:** You explain *how* automation boosts productivity in different fields, which is good for development.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **Transitions:** Sentences often appear as separate points, missing smooth connections (“For instance,” “Additionally,”).
- **Unity:** Ideas jump from office work (data analysis) to creative work without clearly showing the connection or transition.
- **Sentence Structure:** Some sentences are incomplete or run-ons ("For instance. a data analyser..."). This disrupts understanding.
- **Coherence:** The supporting sentences should clearly relate back to the topic sentence and thesis, but some ideas (about unemployment, for example) feel disconnected or tacked on.
- **Repetition:** There’s some overlap in points (“boost productivity,” “do work more easily,” “increase efficiency”), but not much development or explanation.

---

## **Specific Suggestions for Flow & Coherence**

- **Use transitions** to connect ideas smoothly. For example: “One example is… Furthermore, in creative industries… Finally, as a result…”
- **Make sure each sentence directly supports or builds on the previous one.**
- **Remind the reader how each example fits your main point:** After describing automation in creative industries, clarify *why* this is connected to productivity.

---

## **Guiding Questions for Revision**

- Do the examples (data analysis, creative industries) clearly show *how* automation boosts productivity?
- Is there a logical order from main idea → example(s) → result/impact?
- Where could you add words or phrases to make the connections clearer? (e.g. “This means that…”, “For example…”, “In addition…”)
- Does each sentence tie back to your topic sentence and thesis?

Would you like to try revising this paragraph for better flow and coherence, or do you prefer working on just the topic sentence first?  
If you’d like, I can offer some transition phrases or help you reword a sentence to improve coherence—just let me know which part you want to start with!

*Time:* 2025-11-20T08:31:02.305Z

**You:** How to improve my grammar mistakes

*Time:* 2025-11-20T08:36:29.230Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely, improving your grammar is an excellent goal and it will make your writing clearer, more professional, and more persuasive. Since we've already set **coherence and flow** as our main focus, we'll also pay close attention to **grammar and sentence construction** as we work through the revision workflow.

Let's break it down into manageable parts so you can see clear progress and understand *why* certain grammar changes help.

---

# **General Guidance for Improving Grammar**

### 1. **Common Grammar Issues in Your Paragraph**
From your draft, the following grammar problems are most frequent:
- **Subject–verb agreement:** *“This make employee…”* should be *“This makes employees…”*
- **Verb Tense Consistency:** Shifting tenses (e.g., using “boost” and “reduce” when “boosts” and “reduces” would be more correct).
- **Incomplete Sentences/Fragments:** 
    - *“For instance. a data analyser can use Automation…”* (Should be one sentence: “For instance, a data analyst can use automation…”)
- **Articles (a, an, the):** Missing before many nouns: *“the complicated process,” “a data analyst…”*
- **Plural Nouns:** *“employee”* should be *“employees”* (when talking about workers generally).
- **Punctuation:** Missing commas and periods, affecting readability.
- **Word Forms:** *“creative idea for their future”* might be better as *“creative ideas for their work.”*

---

### 2. **Mini-Lesson: How to Check for and Fix These Mistakes**
A) **Subject–Verb Agreement**
- Check the subject (“employees”) and make sure the verb matches in number (“employees *deal*,” or “automation *helps*”).

B) **Complete Sentences**
- Ensure every sentence has a subject and a verb.
    - Incorrect: "For instance. a data analyser can use Automation..."
    - Correct: "For instance, a data analyst can use automation..."

C) **Article Use**
- Use “a” or “an” with singular, countable nouns (e.g., “a benefit,” “an example”).
- Use “the” for specific nouns (e.g., “the process,” “the employees”).

D) **Pluralization**
- Generic references need plurals (e.g., *employees*, *jobs*, *ideas*).

E) **Punctuation and Connectors**
- Combine related ideas with commas or conjunctions for smoother flow.
- Start sentences with linking words if needed: “Additionally, …”, “For example, …” etc.

---

### 3. **Practice & Examples Using Your Own Sentences**
Let’s look at one of your original sentences and improve the grammar step by step. Here’s an example:

**Original:**  
*“The automation helps simplify the complicated progress in different jobs.This make employee to deal with their work more easily For instance. a data analyser can use Automation to summarise and sum up all of the messy data. This reduce the time allocation for tidying up the data in a more convenient way.”*

**Let's correct and separate ideas:**
1. **Article use:** “automation” → “automation”; “progress” should likely be “process.”
2. **Subject–verb agreement:** “This make employee…” → “This makes employees…”
3. **Fragments:** Combine “For instance.” with the next part for a complete sentence.
4. **Consistency/plurals:** “employee” → “employees”; “reduce” → “reduces”.

**Step by step, the changes look like this:**
- “Automation helps simplify the complicated process in different jobs.”
- “This makes it easier for employees to do their work.”
- “For example, a data analyst can use automation to organize and summarize messy data.”
- “This reduces the time needed to prepare the data and makes the process more convenient.”

---

## **Now, Your Turn!**

Choose one or two sentences from your own writing, and try to apply the rules above:
- Check for subject–verb agreement.
- Make sure every sentence has a subject and verb.
- Use articles where necessary.
- Ensure plurals are correct.
- Fix run-on sentences or fragments.

**Would you like to try rewriting a sentence or two now?**  
If you do, please share your revised sentences here and I’ll give you direct feedback and support!

If you want, I can first suggest some possible rewrites for one of your sentences and explain why each change is made. Let me know which sentence you want to work on, or if you want more examples first.

---

**Remember: improving grammar is a process! With feedback and practice using your own sentences, you’ll gain confidence quickly. Let’s do this one step at a time—are you ready to try revising a sentence?**

*Time:* 2025-11-20T08:36:41.310Z

**You:** How about my second point in paragrph structure ?

*Time:* 2025-11-20T08:39:24.076Z

**Assistant:** Great question! You want to focus on your **second point in paragraph structure**—this is very important for both coherence (how your essay “hangs together”) and for clearly guiding your reader through your argument.

Let’s walk through the process step by step, just like an interactive revision session. We’ll focus on improving the structure, flow, and grammar of your second main body paragraph (the one about new job opportunities from automation).

---

## **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision (Second Body Paragraph)**

**Here’s your original topic sentence for the second point:**
> "Apart from that is the new job opportunities from Automation."

**Diagnosis & Feedback:**
- **Clarity:** The meaning is a bit confusing. The sentence structure is awkward.
- **Focus:** It doesn’t clearly state that automation *creates* new jobs, or show the connection to your thesis.
- **Flow:** The transition phrase “Apart from that” is OK, but could be smoother or more natural.

### **Tips to Make a Stronger Topic Sentence:**
- Clearly state the main idea of the paragraph (automation creates new opportunities).
- Connect directly to the thesis (mention global employment or job prospects).
- Use confident, clear language.

#### **Guiding questions:**
- What is the main message you want to communicate in this paragraph: *Is it that automation replaces some jobs but creates new opportunities overall?*
- Can you try stating this idea more directly and clearly?

**Would you like to try rewriting your topic sentence now?**  
For example, you could start:  
"Additionally, automation is opening up new job opportunities in the global workplace."

Try your own version! Write your new topic sentence, and I’ll help you refine it further.

---

Once you've shared your new topic sentence and you’re happy with it, we’ll move to **Step 3: Revising the Rest of Your Paragraph for Flow and Coherence.**

Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now? If yes, just write your sentence here. If you'd like more guidance or an example, let me know!

*Time:* 2025-11-20T08:39:30.609Z

**You:** Is the conclusion consise and sufficient enough to conclude the essay?

*Time:* 2025-11-20T08:45:37.193Z

**Assistant:** Great question! Let's take a close look at your **conclusion** and assess whether it's concise and sufficient for a university-level essay. I'll offer diagnostic feedback based on clarity, structure, and how well it "wraps up" your main ideas.

---

### **Your Original Conclusion:**
> In conclusion, the automation is indeed changing the culture in global employment .But at the same time, it helps increasing productivity and giving employee  a new insight in discovering job opportunities.

---

## **Diagnosis:**

**Strengths:**
- **Restates the Main Idea:** You mention that automation is changing global employment culture.
- **Reflects Main Points:** You reference productivity and job opportunities, connecting back to your key arguments.

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **Grammar & Clarity:**  
    - "the automation" → "automation" (no article needed).
    - "helps increasing productivity" → "helps increase productivity".
    - "giving employee a new insight" → "giving employees new insights".
- **Conciseness:**  
    - The sentence is a bit wordy and could be made more direct.
- **Sufficiency:**  
    - The conclusion should sum up BOTH the main points **and** give a final, insightful thought (e.g., implication, significance, or recommendation).
    - Right now, it doesn't clearly state your overall argument or the positive impact of automation.

---

## **Guiding Questions for Revision:**
- Can you clarify, in one or two sentences, the **overall positive impact** of automation on global employment?
- Would you like to add a brief, forward-looking statement or recommendation? (E.g., "As automation continues to grow, workers and companies should embrace these changes to stay competitive.")

---

## **Sample Conclusion Framework**
1. **Restate Thesis/Main Ideas:**  
   "Overall, automation is transforming global employment by increasing productivity and creating new job opportunities."

2. **Final Insight/Implication:**  
   "To fully benefit from these changes, it is important for workers to adapt and develop new skills that match the evolving workplace."

---

## **Ready to Revise?**
**Would you like to try revising your conclusion now, using these suggestions?**  
You can share your version here, and I'll help you tweak it for clarity and impact.

Or, if you’d prefer, I can provide a few example sentences to guide you. Just let me know!

---
