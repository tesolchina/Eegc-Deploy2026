            ## Contribution Analysis

            It looks like you have not yet revised the thesis statement as suggested, and the essay remains unchanged. Here is a clear next step to help you move forward in the revision process:

**Try revising your thesis statement to be more direct and confident, clearly previewing your two main points.** For example:

“Although government actions are the most impactful in combating climate change, individual green lifestyle choices also play an important role by influencing policies and setting examples for others.”

Would you like help crafting a revised thesis statement based on this model? I can also assist with revising the topic sentence or addressing the grammar issues next. Just let me know!

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Great—thank you for sharing your current thesis statement:

Let’s work through Step 1 (Thesis Revision):

**Feedback:**

- **Clarity & Focus:** Your thesis does answer the essay question, but the wording is a bit long and could be more direct.
- **Main Points Preview:** It mentions government influence and personal actions—great! Consider naming both as main ideas.
- **Confident Language:** Try to avoid “I partly agree/I think/I also think.” Use stronger, assertive statements.
- **Structure:** It could use a smoother transition to preview both main arguments.

**Guiding Questions for Revision:**
- Can you rephrase the thesis so it clearly shows *your position* and *briefly lists your main arguments*?
- Could you use more decisive language (for example: "While government action is most impactful, individual choices still contribute")?

**Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now, using my suggestions?**
