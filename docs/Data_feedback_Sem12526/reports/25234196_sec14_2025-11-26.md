            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing the full report and chat history. Here is a concise summary and guidance to help you move forward effectively:

---

**Summary of Current Status:**

- Your original essay shows a clear “partly agree” stance with two main reasons: influencing government policy and personal lifestyle changes.
- The AI assistant provided detailed, step-by-step support for revising your thesis, topic sentences, and body paragraphs.
- However, in the chat and revised essay, you used placeholders like “let’s pretend we have revised…” and “bla bla bla,” rather than submitting actual revisions.
- This prevented meaningful feedback and iterative improvement.
- The assistant repeatedly requested concrete revisions, especially a revised thesis statement and topic sentences, but these were not provided.
- Grammar, vocabulary precision, and organization also need attention, but the key immediate step is to create actual revised text based on the guidance.

---

**Next Steps for Successful Revision:**

1. **Revise and Submit Your Thesis Statement**  
   Use the assistant’s sentence frames to develop ONE clear, confident sentence that:  
   - States your partly agree position clearly, without “I think” or repeated phrases.  
   - Previews the two reasons you will discuss (citizen influence on government and personal environmental actions).  
   Example frame to adapt:  
   *“Although governments and corporations have the primary capacity to reduce emissions, individuals still play an important role by influencing policy decisions and encouraging more sustainable consumer behavior.”*  
   Please post your revised thesis sentence here so the assistant can give targeted feedback.

2. **Revise and Submit a Topic Sentence for Body Paragraph 1** (government influence)  
   After finalizing your thesis, post the current topic sentence from paragraph 1 or a draft revision based on the assistant’s guidance.  
   Useful frame:  
   *“First, individuals can influence government policy by raising public awareness and voting, which pressures leaders to adopt stronger environmental protections.”*  
   The assistant can help you refine this.

3. **Revise and Submit a Draft for Body Paragraph 1**  
   Using your topic sentence, revise the paragraph to clarify ideas, add specific, supported examples, and fix grammar issues highlighted before.  
   Post this paragraph for detailed feedback and further polishing.

4. **Iterate with the Assistant**  
   Engage in at least 2–3 rounds of revision with the assistant on each part until the writing is clear, cohesive, and well supported.

5. **Address Grammar and Vocabulary**  
   Apply specific micro-edits to formalize tone, fix verb errors, and replace vague expressions with precise, topic-relevant vocabulary.

---

**Additional Recommendations:**

- Avoid placeholders like “let’s pretend…” as they block review and feedback. Instead, draft real text even if it’s rough, then improve in revisions.
- When the assistant suggests changes, respond explicitly by accepting, modifying, or explaining why you prefer a different approach.
- Consider focusing on small sections at a time to avoid overwhelm and gain confidence in revising stepwise.

---

**Encouragement:**

You have a solid foundation and good ideas! Making concrete changes and working closely with the assistant will strengthen your essay significantly and improve both your writing skills and your confidence in working with AI tools.

If you’d like, please start now by posting your revised thesis sentence based on the frames above, and I’ll help you refine it!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The essay takes a clear stance ("I partly agree") and develops two relevant reasons (influencing government; personal lifestyle changes). Examples and causal links are present (e.g., "if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy"), but some claims are general and could be more specific or supported with stronger evidence.
- Organization: 20/25 - Paragraphs follow a logical pattern (intro, government influence, personal actions, conclusion). Some transitions and topic-sentence strength are weak (e.g., "The most important way..." is somewhat absolute given a "partly agree" stance), and paragraph cohesion could be tightened.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary is generally appropriate and clear, but relatively simple and occasionally imprecise ("people don’t care and just want to do what is easy"). More topic-specific terms and precision would raise the score.
- Grammar: 17/25 - Meaning is clear overall, but there are multiple grammar and usage errors that affect formality and clarity (examples: "so is not always working well," "nothing happen," missing articles and subject-verb errors).
- **Original Essay Total: 76/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 12/25 - The revised essay contains placeholders ("bla bla bla...(revised thesis statement here)"), so the substantive thesis and many paragraph revisions are missing. The remaining text repeats original ideas but lacks an actual revised thesis or new development.
- Organization: 12/25 - Structure is disrupted by placeholders and meta-comments (e.g., "let’s pretend we have revised the let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on bla bla bla…"). This interrupts logical flow and makes it unclear which revisions were implemented.
- Vocabulary: 9/25 - Use of non-content placeholders ("bla bla bla") and informal remarks reduces the effective vocabulary assessment. Remaining content retains simple vocabulary from the original but shows no purposeful lexical improvement.
- Grammar: 12/25 - Grammar in the retained original sentences is similar to the original draft, and placeholders/ellipses create additional clarity issues. No meaningful corrective edits can be evaluated.
- **Revised Essay Total: 45/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -31 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None substantive in the written revised essay; assistant guidance in chat suggested precise improvements (thesis framing, topic-sentence strategies), but the student did not implement them in the revised text.
  - The original essay's clear stance and paragraph structure remain present in the revised file (partial carryover).
  - The chat shows the assistant provided useful revision frames and checklists the student could use.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The student did not provide the revised thesis statement — a central required revision — despite multiple assistant prompts.
  - Topic sentence revisions were not produced; instead placeholders appear in the revised essay.
  - Body-paragraph revision (paragraph 1) was not completed; the student returned placeholders rather than an edited paragraph.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9**
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided structured, detailed guidance (thesis frames, topic-sentence frames, checklists) and repeatedly requested concrete student revisions. The student repeatedly replied with placeholders or "let’s pretend" statements instead of submitting actual edits, so the interaction did not progress into meaningful revisions. Evidence: assistant prompt — "Would you like to try revising the thesis now? Paste your revised thesis here." Student reply — "let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on bla bla bla..." (timestamp 08:55:49). Later the student again wrote "let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on bla bla bla…" (timestamp 09:07:12) and "ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph#1  bla bla bla" (timestamp 09:09:29).

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - The chat contains multiple exchanges (9 messages) and the assistant supplied in-depth procedural guidance, but the student did not engage deeply with concrete revisions. This is a developing-level conversation rather than highly in-depth (no sustained rounds of detailed edits).
  - Evidence: several assistant messages with stepwise revision instructions, but user responses lack substantive content.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - The student did not critically evaluate or accept/reject specific AI suggestions with reasons; instead they avoided producing actual revisions. Most AI suggestions were neither accepted nor critically reviewed in the chat.
  - Evidence: assistant provided concrete suggestions and checklists; student responded with "let's pretend..." rather than addressing the suggestions.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - There is evidence of an intended iterative process (assistant asked for a thesis, then topic sentences, then paragraphs), but the student did not follow through with multiple meaningful revision cycles. Minimal refinement occurred.
  - Evidence: assistant repeatedly requested revised thesis and topic sentences before paragraph edits, and the student repeatedly declined to provide them.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The original draft demonstrates a clear, balanced position and organizes ideas into logical paragraphs (evidence: "I partly agree..." and separate paragraphs for government influence and personal actions).
- The assistant provided high-quality, actionable guidance (thesis frames, topic-sentence frames, a checklist).
- The student recognized the tasks verbally and attempted to continue the session (sent multiple replies), indicating engagement with the activity flow.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- The student must produce concrete revisions (a revised thesis sentence, a revised topic sentence, and an edited body paragraph). Current placeholders prevent assessment and learning.
- The student should respond to AI suggestions with explicit acceptance, modification, or rejection, and brief rationale to demonstrate critical evaluation.
- More attention to grammar and sentence-level editing is needed (examples: "so is not always working well," "nothing happen") to improve clarity and academic tone.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student did not supply the requested revised thesis or revised paragraphs, limiting the AI's ability to act on context.
  - Evidence: repeated assistant prompts asking for a revised thesis; student replied "let's pretend..." rather than pasting a revision.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The student did not follow the structured revision plan the assistant proposed (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), so iterative strategy stalled.
  - Evidence: assistant's outlined stepwise process was not completed.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student did not accept or critique AI suggestions explicitly.
  - Evidence: no messages indicating acceptance/rejection with reasons.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The revised essay file contains placeholders rather than evidence of independent edits.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise and submit the thesis statement as requested — use the assistant's sentence frames and post the single revised sentence in chat so the assistant can give targeted feedback.
2. Produce at least one concrete revision cycle: paste a revised topic sentence and an edited version of paragraph 1 (or 2), then iterate with the assistant's feedback until it is polished. Aim for 2–3 revision iterations.
3. Address grammar and vocabulary issues by applying specific edits suggested in chat (e.g., remove informal phrasing like "I think," fix missing articles and verb forms). Use short micro-edits and ask the assistant to proofread them.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student did not complete the three required revision tasks: revised thesis statement, revised topic sentence, and revised body paragraph. The revised document contains placeholders and meta-comments preventing substantive assessment of revision quality.
- The AI assistant provided clear, scaffolded guidance; the student did not implement it. Recommend instructor follow-up to require submission of the three concrete revisions (thesis sentence, one revised topic sentence, and one revised body paragraph) and to encourage the student to engage in at least two meaningful iterations with the AI.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. bla bla bla...(revised thesis statement here)

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. let’s pretend we have revised the let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on bla bla bla…When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. revise the rest of body paragraph#1...

*Time:* 2025-11-26T09:14:09.913Z

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-26T08:44:14.985Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T08:44:36.260Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a good start. I see your current thesis at the end:  
"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Step 1 — Feedback on your thesis
- Clarity and focus: Your position is clear (you partly agree). However, the sentence is long and repeats phrases like "I believe" and "I also think," which weakens the academic tone.
- Strength: The thesis states two reasons (influence on government; personal lifestyle choices), but it could be stronger if it previews how those two points connect to the argument (for example: policy change vs. market/social influence).
- Precision: Replace vague language (“very important,” “a role to play”) with specific claims (e.g., how individuals influence policy and consumer demand).
- Structure: A thesis for this essay should both answer the question directly and preview the two main reasons you will develop in the body paragraphs.

Quick revision guidance (not a full rewrite — use these fragments to build your own sentence)
- Start with a clear stance: “I partly agree” or “I agree to some extent.”
- Follow with a concise contrast: governments/corporations have greater capacity or responsibility.
- Then preview two clear functions of individual action: 1) pressure/influence on policy/politicians, and 2) influence on market/consumer behavior and social norms.

Sentence frame examples you can adapt (fill in with your own words):
- “Although governments and corporations have the primary capacity to reduce emissions, individual actions remain important because they _______ and _______.”
- “I partially agree; while large institutions can make systemic change, individuals can still prompt policy shifts by _______ and change business practices by _______.”

Would you like to try revising the thesis now using those suggestions? When you’re happy with the revision, tell me and then choose which body paragraph you want to work on (paragraph 1 about influencing government, or paragraph 2 about personal lifestyle changes).

*Time:* 2025-11-26T08:44:49.659Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on bla bla bla...

*Time:* 2025-11-26T08:55:49.575Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s move to Step 2.

Which body paragraph would you like to work on: paragraph 1 (influence on government) or paragraph 2 (personal lifestyle changes)? Paste the current topic sentence you want to revise (or tell me if you want to keep the one in your draft), and I’ll give focused feedback on how well it connects to your revised thesis and how to strengthen it.

Quick tips as you choose:
- If your thesis now says governments/corporations have primary capacity but individuals matter by pressuring policy and shaping markets/norms, a topic sentence should signal which of those two functions this paragraph will develop.
- Avoid absolute words that contradict “partly agree” (e.g., “the most important” may be too strong if your thesis is balanced). Use signposting words like “first,” “another,” or “additionally” to show structure.

Helpful sentence frames you can adapt (don’t copy them exactly — try writing your own first):
- For the government paragraph: “First, individuals can influence government policy by [brief mechanism], which can lead to [effect].”
- For the lifestyle/market paragraph: “Second, everyday consumer and lifestyle choices — such as [example] — can shift market demand and social norms, encouraging businesses to adopt greener practices.”

Would you like to try revising the chosen topic sentence now? Paste your attempt and I’ll give feedback before we revise the rest of that paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T08:56:02.725Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on bla bla bla…

*Time:* 2025-11-26T09:07:12.454Z

**Assistant:** Great — you already have a clear starting thesis and good ideas. Let’s complete Step 1 before we move on.

Please try revising your thesis now. Use this quick checklist as you write:
- Directly answer the question and state how much you agree (e.g., “I partly agree” or “I agree to some extent”).
- Preview the two main reasons you will develop (keep each reason short and specific).
- Use confident, academic language (no “I think,” no repeated phrases).
- Keep it one clear sentence if possible.

Two short sentence frames you can adapt (fill in your own words — do not copy exactly unless it fits):
- “Although governments and corporations have the primary capacity to reduce emissions, individuals still matter because they [first function] and [second function].”
- “I partially agree: large institutions can create systemic change, but individuals can prompt policy shifts by [mechanism] and influence markets and social norms by [mechanism].”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Paste your revised thesis here. Once you’re satisfied with it, tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (paragraph 1: influencing government, or paragraph 2: lifestyle/market changes) and paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence. We’ll revise the topic sentence next.

*Time:* 2025-11-26T09:07:27.483Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph#1  bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-11-26T09:09:29.298Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m ready to work on paragraph 1 with you. Before we revise that paragraph, we need to finish Step 1 and revise the thesis (this is required). Please paste your revised thesis here.

Quick checklist for the thesis as you write it:
- State your position clearly (e.g., “I partly agree” or “I agree to some extent”).
- Preview the two main reasons you will develop (short and specific).
- Use confident, academic language (no “I think,” avoid repetition).
- Keep it to one clear sentence if possible.

Two short sentence frames you can adapt (use your own words — don’t copy unless it fits):
- “Although governments and corporations have the primary capacity to reduce emissions, individuals still matter because they [first function] and [second function].”
- “I partially agree: while large institutions can implement systemic change, individuals can prompt policy shifts by [mechanism] and influence markets and social norms by [mechanism].”

When you post your revised thesis and confirm you’re happy with it, paste the current topic sentence from body paragraph 1 (the paragraph about influencing government). Quick tip for that topic sentence:
- Make the link to the updated thesis explicit (use “First,” or “To begin with,” if your thesis previews this reason).
- Avoid absolute language that contradicts “partly agree” (e.g., “the most important” may be too strong).

A couple of short topic-sentence frames you can adapt:
- “First, individuals can influence government policy by [brief mechanism], leading to [effect].”
- “To begin with, public pressure from citizens can prompt political leaders to adopt stronger environmental policies, such as [example].”

Would you like to try the thesis revision now? Paste it here, then paste the paragraph-1 topic sentence so we can revise it together.
