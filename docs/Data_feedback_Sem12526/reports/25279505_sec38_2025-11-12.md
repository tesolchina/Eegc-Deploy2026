            ## Contribution Analysis

            It looks like you have identified your thesis statement well, and the AI has provided clear feedback to help you improve it. To move forward, try rewriting your thesis statement incorporating the suggestions—for example, making it more direct, confident, and concise, while clearly presenting the two main points: individuals' influence on government policy and the role of personal lifestyle choices.

If you like, I can provide a simple template to guide your revision. Would you like me to do that? Alternatively, you can attempt your revised thesis now, and I can give feedback on it.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay writing skills**: Actively revise parts of your essay following feedback, and try to make at least one revision for each targeted area (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph).
2. **AI collaboration skills**: Ask questions about unclear feedback, offer your own suggestions, and discuss your reasoning for accepting or rejecting AI proposals.
3. **Overall improvement**: Try to move through complete revision cycles—edit, review together with AI, and refine again—so your improvement can be measured and enhanced.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
Student attempted the first step (locating thesis), but did not proceed with the revision process. Encourage the student to continue the AI-guided revision phase and submit at least one revised element (thesis statement, topic sentence, body paragraph) before the next assessment.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is one of the most pressing global crises today, and a key debate persists: do individual actions matter alongside governments and corporations? I argue individuals are far from irrelevant—their greatest impact lies in driving governmental policy change, while daily green choices also contribute to collective progress, making cross-sector collaboration essential.
Individuals’ most impactful role is shaping government action through collective advocacy. As governments answer to citizens, widespread demand for environmental protection—via voting for sustainability-focused leaders, grassroots protests, or public appeals—creates tangible pressure for systemic change. For instance, citizen movements in multiple countries have successfully pushed for plastic bans and carbon reduction policies. While this influence isn’t always perfect (governments may offer superficial responses, and some lack clear voice channels), collective public pressure remains a cornerstone of policy shifts that individuals alone could never achieve.
Individual lifestyle choices, though small in isolation, add up to meaningful progress. Simple acts like recycling, conserving water, choosing public transport over driving, or buying eco-friendly products may seem trivial, but when adopted by millions, they foster a cultural shift toward sustainability. These choices also send a powerful market signal to corporations: consumers prioritize green options, incentivizing businesses to adopt sustainable practices for profit. While challenges like convenience-driven choices or fragmented participation exist, these individual efforts complement governmental and corporate actions, forming a vital part of the solution.
 
In conclusion, individual actions are indispensable in fighting climate change. They drive transformative policy change and build collective momentum through daily choices. Ultimately, addressing the crisis requires synergy—bold government policies, corporate responsibility, and individual commitment. Only through such collaboration can we mitigate climate change and secure a sustainable future.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

**You:** Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s start with Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision.

**Here is your current thesis statement:**

> Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

**My feedback:**

- **Clarity:** The statement is generally clear, but it’s a bit long and wordy. Try to state your main argument more directly.
- **Strength:** Avoid “I think” or “I also think.” Use more confident and direct language.
- **Focus:** You do preview your main points (influence on government, personal lifestyle). That’s good! Maybe make the balance between these two roles clearer.
- **Academic tone:** Consider condensing ideas for impact and removing personal pronouns if possible.

**Key points for a strong thesis:**
- Clearly responds to the essay topic (“Do individual actions matter?”)
- Signals your point of view and main reasons.
- Stays confident, precise, and academic.

**Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now?**
Aim for one or two sentences. If you’d like, I can give you a framework to help you get started.
