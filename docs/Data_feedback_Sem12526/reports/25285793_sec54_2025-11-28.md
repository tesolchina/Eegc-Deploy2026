            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing the assessment report and the chat history! It looks like the student made significant improvements in clarity, organization, vocabulary, and grammar based on AI guidance, even though the interactive chat was limited and revision mostly happened offline.

If you want, I can help by providing:

(a) One or two concrete example sentences or brief data points the student could add to strengthen each body paragraph (job loss, skill erosion, early retirement).

(b) A model concluding paragraph that synthesizes the essay’s argument more powerfully and leaves a clear, memorable recommendation.

Would you like me to proceed with these suggestions? Or do you prefer help with something else, such as advice on improving the chat-based human-AI collaboration or refining language use further?

            ## 🟤 Grading Result *(Hidden from Students)*

            The student has completed the three revision tasks (revised thesis statement, revised a topic sentence, and revised a body paragraph). I do not say "not finished."

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - Main ideas are present (job loss, skill loss, early retirement) but underdeveloped and unclear; reasoning is often hard to follow because of errors. Evidence: original lists reasons but offers little development: "My reason are as followed:" then brief, confusing points.
- Organization: 15/25 - Paragraphing and logical flow are weak; ideas are mixed together without clear topic sentences or transitions. Evidence: many ideas and attempted solutions are in one long block; introduction lacks a clear thesis.
- Vocabulary: 14/25 - Frequent misspellings and inappropriate word choices interfere with clarity (e.g., "compenhensive", "conventence", "meaningfee"). Limited use of precise topic vocabulary.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 14/25 - Frequent punctuation, agreement, and sentence-fragment problems that impede comprehension (e.g., "Due to its efficient. people..." ; "Firse of au, automation takes the place of people can strengen the intensity of job market").
- **Original Essay Total: 60/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised essay presents a clear position and develops the three main concerns (job loss, skill erosion, early retirement) and offers policy/individual responses. The ideas are more coherent though argument depth and examples remain limited.
- Organization: 21/25 - Clearer paragraphing and logical progression: introduction states the issue, body paragraphs each address one concern, and closing paragraph offers solutions and restates position.
- Vocabulary: 21/25 - Much improved word choice and corrected spelling (e.g., "efficiency," "convenience," "high-tech"). Vocabulary is appropriate and more precise, though still somewhat general.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 21/25 - Sentences are grammatical and punctuation is fixed; varied sentence structures are used. A few stylistic refinements would still improve flow and rhetorical force.
- **Revised Essay Total: 84/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +24 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Revised and clarified the thesis/position: original vague "From my point of view..." became a clear stance — "From my perspective, although automation is beneficial, human beings should apply it appropriately."
  - Created clearer topic sentences and paragraph structure: e.g., "Firstly, as automation replaces human labor, it can intensify competition in the job market..." which links each paragraph to the thesis.
  - Fixed numerous language errors: spelling, punctuation, and word choice were corrected across the essay (see examples below).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Provide concrete examples, data, or a brief hypothetical scenario to strengthen claims (e.g., specific industries or statistics).
  - Add stronger linking sentences and transitional phrases between paragraphs to emphasize logical progression and comparative importance.
  - Vary sentence length and use more advanced syntactic structures and stronger concluding sentence to increase rhetorical impact.

Evidence (selected quotations):
- Original problematic sentence: "Due to its efficient. people can enjoy the conventence which was brought by at automation…" 
- Revised improved sentence: "Thanks to its efficiency, people can enjoy the convenience brought by automation and focus on more meaningful work instead of repeating simple tasks."
- Original unclear thesis attempt: "Erom my point of view, although automation is useful. & human beings should apply is properl"
- Revised clearer thesis: "From my perspective, although automation is beneficial, human beings should apply it appropriately."

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 7 messages** (4 assistant messages, 3 user messages).
- **Conversation Quality:** The AI assistant provided structured guidance (diagnosis, stepwise revision plan, lists of spelling/grammar corrections, and recommended priorities). The student asked targeted questions about spelling, structure, and grammar but did not engage in a prolonged iterative exchange in the chat (no explicit accept/reject decisions recorded there). The chat is useful as a diagnostic and planning stage but lacks documented back-and-forth revisions in the chat itself.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Developing. The chat shows several meaningful prompts from the assistant and follow-up questions from the student, but the interaction is short (7 messages) and lacks the extended iterative cycles (15+ exchanges) that indicate deep, multi-step collaboration.
  - Evidence: assistant outlines a three-step revision workflow and provides a detailed diagnostics list; user responds with questions but does not complete the stepwise selection process in-chat.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - Basic. There is little documented evidence that the student critically evaluated or contested AI suggestions in the chat. The student asked questions (about spelling/structure/grammar), but did not provide recorded decisions or reasoning about accepting or rejecting specific edits.
  - Evidence: assistant lists corrective suggestions and asks the student to choose priorities; the student does not select or argue for particular changes in the chat history.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - Basic. The assistant recommended a multi-step revision process (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph revision). The chat shows planning and diagnostic stages but no multi-round iterative editing process documented in the chat itself.
  - Evidence: assistant: "Step 1: Revise your thesis statement. Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence. Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph..." The student did not complete those steps in the chat transcript, although the revised essay (provided outside the chat) shows the student implemented changes.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Improved clarity and coherence: The revised essay shows clear organization and a comprehensible argument structure (evidence: distinct topic sentences in each paragraph).
- Successful language correction: Many spelling, punctuation, and word-choice errors were corrected (e.g., "conventence" → "convenience"; "compenhensive" → "comprehensive").
- Ability to act on guidance: Even though the chat did not record iterative steps, the revised essay demonstrates that the student applied the assistant’s recommendations (thesis clarified, paragraphs restructured).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Support and development: Add specific examples, data, or brief evidence to substantiate key claims (e.g., cite an affected industry or a hypothetical example of job displacement).
- Deeper engagement in the AI-assisted process: Use the chat to document choices — accept/reject suggestions with reasons — to strengthen critical review skills.
- Rhetorical polish: Strengthen transitions, vary sentence structures more, and end with a compelling conclusion that synthesizes implications.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Good - The student provided the essay and asked focused questions (spelling, structure, grammar), giving the assistant enough context to provide targeted advice.
- Strategic Planning: Needs Improvement - The assistant offered a clear revision plan, but the student did not select or discuss priorities explicitly in the chat; the plan was implemented offline rather than through iterative chat steps.
- Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement - Little evidence in the chat that the student evaluated alternative suggestions or explained why specific changes were accepted or rejected.
- Independent Editing: Good - The final revised essay shows the student can independently apply corrections and reorganize the essay, even if that work was done outside the documented chat.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Strengthen arguments with brief, concrete examples or data (even hypothetical) to make claims more persuasive (e.g., name an industry or describe a plausible scenario of job displacement).
2. Use the chat to document decision-making: when the AI suggests changes, state whether you accept them and why (or propose an alternative). This will improve critical-review skills and produce better-documented revision cycles for instructors.
3. Work on higher-level stylistic moves: stronger transitions, a more forceful concluding paragraph, and varied sentence rhythms (short/long sentences) to increase readability and rhetorical effect.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student made clear, measurable improvements to the essay’s clarity, organization, and language. The final product is a coherent short essay with a clear viewpoint and improved grammar.
- The chat history shows useful AI guidance but limited documented iterative collaboration; encourage the student to make revision decisions visible in the chat (this helps assess their critical engagement with AI suggestions).
- Recommend asking the student to add one concrete supporting example in a revision to demonstrate deeper development of ideas.

If helpful, I can (a) suggest one or two concrete examples the student could add to each body paragraph, and (b) provide a model stronger concluding paragraph that synthesizes the argument and leaves a clear recommendation.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Nowadays, automation is developing more
and more compenhensive. Due to its efficient. people can enjoy the conventence which was brought by at automation and do more meaningfee work instead of doing the simple and repeating work...
However. as we looking for the long term. it may cause a series of troubles. My reason are as followed:
Firse of au, automation takes the place of people can strengen the intensity of job market and let more people lose the opportuney to earn their life. Not all people are good at Al or high technology serv device, which means they may under big pressure with the development of * automation. Secondly. Due to the accurue of automation, using automation devica instead ef manpower seems a clever choice. But it may cause people deeply rely en the automation, lead to they may not good at the skius in the long term. as the some ques " practice makes prefect. leople
need practice. Thirdly, automation can lead the retirement comes early. If mere and more people retire earty earlier than before, the finance pressure of the government is really huge.
Erom my point of view, although automation is useful. & human beings should apply is properl Firse of au government shouid encourage more and more young men to dive it into high technology science. At the same time. government shoTs. supposed to enhance society welfire wealth fire to ensure the fundemantal life of their cretzens.
Secondly. scientist th and the manager of nost industr shoned regulate the applym

Revised:
Nowadays, automation is becoming increasingly comprehensive. Thanks to its efficiency, people can enjoy the convenience brought by automation and focus on more meaningful work instead of repeating simple tasks.

However, in the long run, automation may give rise to a series of problems. Firstly, as automation replaces human labor, it can intensify competition in the job market and deprive many people of employment opportunities to earn a living. Not everyone is proficient in AI or high-tech devices, meaning they may face great pressure amid the rapid development of automation. Secondly, while automation is highly accurate and using automated devices instead of manual work seems a wise choice, it may lead people to become overly reliant on such technology. In the long term, this could weaken their practical skills—after all, "practice makes perfect," and people need constant practice to maintain and improve their abilities. Thirdly, automation may accelerate the trend of early retirement. If more and more people retire earlier than before, governments will face enormous financial pressure.

From my perspective, although automation is beneficial, human beings should apply it appropriately. To address these issues, governments should first encourage more young people to engage in high-tech research and development. Meanwhile, they ought to strengthen social welfare systems to ensure the basic living standards of their citizens. Secondly, scientists and industry managers should regulate the application of automation to avoid excessive replacement of human labor. Last but not least, individuals should continuously enhance their own skills. If we become competent enough, no technology will ever fully replace us.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

**You:** Is there any word spelling problems in this context
/

*Time:* 2025-11-28T10:29:59.901Z

**Assistant:** Great — I can help with that. Before I jump in, a quick question: what do you most want to improve in this session? (Choose one or two: spelling/grammar, clarity of argument/thesis, paragraph structure, or style/word choice.)

Quick diagnostic (brief)
- Strengths: You have clear ideas and a basic paragraph structure (you list reasons and try to give solutions). The main points (job loss, loss of skills, earlier retirement) are present.
- Main weaknesses (based on the rubric categories):
  - Language Use: many spelling mistakes, some word-choice errors, and punctuation problems that make the meaning unclear.
  - Thesis & Argument: the central claim is unclear (I can help sharpen it once you confirm your target).
  - Organization / Evidence: ideas are present but need clearer topic sentences and better development.

You asked about spelling specifically — yes, there are many spelling (and some small word-choice) problems. Here’s a helpful list of the words/phrases I found with suggested corrections (left = original, right = correction or suggestion):

- compenhensive → comprehensive
- efficient. → efficiency (or “efficient” with punctuation fixed: “efficient,”)
- conventence → convenience
- at automation → automation
- meaningfee → meaningful
- repeating → repetitive
- My reason are as followed: → My reasons are as follows:
- Firse → First
- of au → of all
- strengen → strengthen (but consider “increase” or “intensify”)
- opportuney → opportunity
- Al → AI
- high technology serv device → high-tech devices / high-technology devices
- under big pressure → under great pressure (grammar rather than spelling)
- accurue → accuracy
- devica → device
- ef → of
- rely en → rely on
- skius → skills
- as the some ques " practice makes prefect. leople need practice. → as the saying goes, “practice makes perfect;” people need practice.
- prefect → perfect
- leople → people
- retirement comes early → (grammatical revision: “lead to earlier retirement”)
- mere → more
- earty → early
- finance pressure → financial pressure
- Erom → From
- apply is properl → apply it properly
- Firse of au → First of all
- shouid → should
- dive it into → (probably “drive it into” or “encourage them to enter” — clarify meaning)
- high technology science → science and technology / high-tech fields
- shoTs. supposed → should (formatting/punctuation problem)
- welfire → welfare
- fundemantal → fundamental
- cretzens → citizens
- scientist th → scientists and
- manager of nost industr → managers of most industries
- shoned → should
- applym -en of antomation → application of automation
- Lease → least
- our humans ought to boost our ownsius → (probably “we should strengthen our own… consciousness” — spelling: ownsius → consciousness)
- I we re → If we’re
- win → will

Also note: AI should be capitalized; use consistent punctuation (commas, full stops) and watch homophones (ef → of; win → will) and missing letters.

Next step — choose priorities
Which two issues would you like to work on in this session? Options I recommend based on your essay:
1) Spelling & basic grammar (fix words above and punctuation)
2) Thesis clarity and strength
3) Topic sentence for one paragraph and the paragraph’s coherence

If you want to focus on spelling first, I’ll proceed by Step 1 of our revision workflow (ask you to share your thesis statement). If you want to focus on thesis or paragraph structure, we’ll do that instead. Which do you choose?

*Time:* 2025-11-28T10:30:25.180Z

**You:** Is there anything wrong with the structure of this article

*Time:* 2025-11-28T10:31:30.635Z

**Assistant:** Short answer: Yes—there are structural problems, but they’re fixable. Below I’ll explain what’s off and suggest a clear plan so you can choose what to focus on next.

Quick diagnosis of structure (what’s wrong)
- Introduction: There isn’t a clear thesis that answers the question (to what extent you agree/disagree). The sentence that tries to state your view (“From my point of view...”) is incomplete and unclear. An introduction should: (1) introduce the topic briefly, (2) state your position clearly, and (3) preview the main points.
- Paragraphing / organization: Your ideas are all in one block and jump from reasons to solutions without clear paragraph breaks. Each main idea (job loss, loss of skills, earlier retirement, and possible solutions) should be at least its own paragraph.
- Topic sentences: Most paragraphs lack clear topic sentences that connect the paragraph’s idea to your thesis. Instead you list reasons without signalling how each reason supports your overall claim.
- Development and coherence: Reasons are listed but often not explained or supported with examples. Sentences within paragraphs sometimes don’t link logically (transitions are missing).
- Conclusion: There’s no clear concluding paragraph that restates your position and summarises implications or recommendations.
- Order and emphasis: The order of reasons should show a logical progression (e.g., most important to least, or problem→cause→solution). Right now it’s hard to see that plan.

Concrete suggestions (how to improve structure)
- Write one clear thesis in the introduction that answers the question and previews 2–3 main points. For example, “I partially disagree; individual actions matter but government and corporate action is essential; I will explain X, Y, Z.” (We’ll craft it together.)
- Make each main point a separate body paragraph:
  - Paragraph 1 topic sentence: how automation causes job loss (explain and give an example).
  - Paragraph 2 topic sentence: how automation can reduce workers’ skills/experience (explain).
  - Paragraph 3 topic sentence: how automation can affect retirement/finances and then offer solutions or policies.
  - Final paragraph: a short conclusion restating your position and suggesting what both individuals and governments can do.
- Start each paragraph with a topic sentence that clearly connects to your thesis, then give explanation, an example or evidence (even a hypothetical example), and a linking sentence back to the thesis.
- Use clear transitions (First, Second, Third; however; therefore) and keep sentences focused—one idea per sentence.

Next step — choose targets
Which two issues do you want us to work on in this session? Based on what you asked and what I see, I recommend picking two of:
1) Thesis clarity and strength
2) Paragraph structure and topic sentences
3) Spelling & basic grammar
4) Style / word choice

Because you asked about structure, I suggest 1) Thesis clarity and 2) Paragraph structure/topic sentences. Do you agree with that choice? If yes, tell me which body paragraph you want to revise first (I suggest the paragraph about job loss). Also please paste your current thesis statement (or the sentence you think is your thesis). Once you confirm, we’ll begin Step 1 (thesis revision).

*Time:* 2025-11-28T10:31:47.509Z

**You:** Is there any problem with the grammar of this article?

*Time:* 2025-11-28T10:32:39.100Z

**Assistant:** Short answer: Yes — there are multiple grammar problems that make many sentences hard to understand. I can help you fix them, but first let’s set clear targets so we focus the session where you want it.

Brief diagnosis of the grammar issues (main types)
- Sentence fragments and punctuation errors (periods in the middle of sentences, missing commas).
- Word forms and verb issues (efficient → efficiency; apply is → apply it).
- Articles, prepositions and word order (rely en → rely on; in the long term → long-term use).
- Spelling and capitalization (compenhensive → comprehensive; Al → AI).
- Agreement and phrasing (My reason are → My reasons are; retirement comes early → earlier retirement).

A few short corrections so you can see what I mean (I’ll guide you to do more):
- Original: “Due to its efficient. people can enjoy the conventence which was brought by at automation…”
  Correction: “Because of its efficiency, people can enjoy the convenience brought by automation…”
- Original: “My reason are as followed:”
  Correction: “My reasons are as follows:”
- Original: “Firse of au, automation takes the place of people…”
  Correction: “First of all, automation replaces people…”
- Original: “as the some ques " practice makes prefect. leople need practice.”
  Correction: “As the saying goes, ‘practice makes perfect;’ people need practice.”
- Original: “Erom my point of view, although automation is useful. & human beings should apply is properl”
  Correction: “From my point of view, although automation is useful, human beings should apply it properly.”

Choose targets
Which two of these would you like to focus on in this session? (Pick two.)
- Spelling & basic grammar
- Thesis clarity and strength
- Paragraph structure and topic sentences
- Style / word choice

My recommendation: focus on Spelling & basic grammar + Thesis clarity and structure (so we get clear meaning + clear argument). Do you agree?

If yes, next step
If you choose thesis clarity as one target, paste your current thesis statement (or point me to the sentence you think is your thesis). Also tell me which body paragraph you want to revise first — I suggest the paragraph about job loss. Once you confirm, we’ll begin Step 1 (thesis revision). Would you like to start?
