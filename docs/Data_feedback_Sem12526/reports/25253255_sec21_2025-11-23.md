# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT  

## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship  
## Module: AI for Revising Essays  

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT  

#### Original Essay  
The original essay presented a clear position that automation will improve employment prospects but suffered from vague ideas, disorganized paragraphs, basic vocabulary, and many grammatical errors. Ambiguous phrasing and sentence structure issues weakened clarity and persuasiveness.

#### Revised Essay  
The student successfully revised the thesis to a clear, confident statement previewing two main reasons: creation of new technology-related roles and enabling workers to move into higher-skilled positions. The chosen body paragraph was substantially improved with a rewritten topic sentence, concrete job examples (AI specialists, data analysts, maintenance technicians), and clear supporting sentences explaining how these roles appear and how retraining programs upskill workers. This paragraph was also proofread for grammar and clarity, including a wording tweak replacing "AI trainers" with "AI specialists."  

However, the introduction and opposing-view paragraph remained underdeveloped and contained grammatical weaknesses, and the conclusion was left unrevised, continuing with unclear phrasing and structural issues.

---

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT  

The chat history shows a highly structured, iterative process aligned well with the three-step framework: thesis revision → topic sentence revision → paragraph revision. The student actively participated by selecting models, requesting targeted edits, and applying proofreading suggestions. The student demonstrated good strategic planning and engaging collaboration, though there was room to deepen critical evaluation by providing explicit justifications or proposing original rewrites alongside AI suggestions.

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY  

**Strengths:**  
- Complete and focused completion of all assigned revision tasks.  
- Effective incorporation of concrete examples to support abstract claims (specific AI-related job roles).  
- Clear improvement in paragraph clarity, logical flow, and grammar after proofreading.  
- Strong engagement with the iterative human-AI workflow, showing motivation for progressive refinement.

**Areas for Development:**  
- Revise remaining parts of the essay (introduction, opposing viewpoint paragraph, conclusion) with similar rigor for coherence, grammar, and clarity.  
- Deepen evidence development by including stronger, more detailed examples, possibly referencing data or real-world cases to enhance credibility.  
- Enhance independent critical review skills by justifying AI suggestions or experimenting with original phrasing to deepen learning and ownership.  

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT  
1. Undertake multi-step revisions on the introduction and conclusion, ensuring thesis restatement and clear summaries of main reasons, ending with a concise, impactful closing sentence.  
2. Bolster argumentation with concrete external evidence or statistics to strengthen persuasiveness and demonstrate research skills.  
3. Practice independent rewriting before selecting AI-generated models, and when choosing among suggestions, explicitly explain your reasoning to enhance critical thinking.  

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES  

- The student’s focused and systematic approach merits commendation; all three critical revision tasks were addressed successfully, reflecting sustained effort and collaboration.  
- The assistant provided scaffolded support with clear models and micro-prompts, and the student made thoughtful selections and applied changes effectively.  
- Attention should be given to aligning the essay topic consistently with the assignment prompt and ensuring all essay sections are polished for grammar and coherence.  
- Encouraging justification for AI suggestions would further strengthen the student’s editorial judgment and writing autonomy.  

---

**Summary:** The student demonstrated commendable progress in key revision areas, substantially improving content clarity and grammatical accuracy in the core paragraph and thesis. Continued work on remaining sections, enhanced evidence depth, and deeper independent editing will consolidate these gains and elevate overall essay quality.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The original essay has a clear position (automation will improve employment) and some relevant reasons, but ideas are underdeveloped and sometimes vague ("Humane have brain knowledge and emotion"), which limits persuasive power.
- Organization: 17/25 - The student uses a counterargument + response structure, but transitions and paragraph coherence are weak and some paragraphs read as disorganized.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Vocabulary is basic and contains frequent word-choice errors (e.g., "enhance the ability," "job reduce"), limiting precision.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Many errors in sentence structure, verb forms, capitalization, punctuation that impede readability.
- **Original Essay Total: 63/100**

Evidence (original): “I hold a strong stance that this technological shift ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term is the most responsible perspective,” (unclear grammar); “Humane have brain knowledge and emotion. Al not alternative people to do things.” (multiple errors and low clarity).

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised essay presents clearer, more convincing reasons (creating tech roles; upskilling workers) and includes concrete job examples (AI specialists, data analysts). This strengthens content and argumentation.
- Organization: 19/25 - The targeted paragraph shows clear logical progression (topic sentence → evidence → link back to thesis). However, intro and conclusion remain weak and some other paragraphs still lack internal coherence.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Improved use of specific terms ("AI specialists," "data annotation," "retraining"), but overall lexical variety is still moderate and some awkward phrasing remains elsewhere.
- Grammar: 17/25 - The revised body paragraph was proofread and cleaned up; many sentence-level errors remain in other parts (opposing paragraph, introduction, and conclusion).
- **Revised Essay Total: 75/100**

Evidence (revised): Thesis: “Although automation will eliminate some jobs in the short term, I believe it will ultimately increase employment by creating new technology-related roles and enabling workers to move into higher-skilled, more productive positions.” Topic sentence: “However, I believe this technological shift will expand employment by creating new technology-related roles, such as AI specialists, data analysts, and maintenance technicians.” Supporting evidence: “For example, companies that adopt AI need AI specialists to label data and guide machine-learning models, which creates paid positions in data annotation, model validation, and quality control.”

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +12 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis revised to a clear, previewing sentence that states position and two reasons.
  - Topic sentence rewritten to directly tie to the thesis and provide concrete job examples.
  - Body paragraph revised with concrete mechanisms (who hires, what tasks they perform) and a clear closing sentence; the paragraph was proofread for grammar and clarity and “AI trainers” was broadened to “AI specialists.”
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Introduction still contains mismatched phrasing and grammatical errors (the opening sentence remains awkward and the essay header mentions climate-change prompt — possible prompt mismatch).
  - The opposing-view paragraph remains grammatically weak and underdeveloped; it needs clearer examples and smoother transitions.
  - Conclusion was not revised; it remains unclear and fails to succinctly restate the thesis and summarize the reasons.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 43** (extensive back-and-forth; many iterative turns where the assistant proposed models and the student accepted/selected and requested further edits)
- **Conversation Quality:** Highly structured and iterative. The assistant followed a three-step workflow (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), provided models and micro-prompts, and the student actively selected options, accepted models, and requested targeted changes (e.g., “edit A,” “Model1,” “Proofread paragraph,” “make one small wording tweak in that paragraph”).

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - Evidence: The chat history shows an extensive session (≈43 messages) with stepwise guidance, multiple model options, diagnostics, and iterative revision. The assistant and student exchanged detailed, task-focused turns throughout.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - Evidence: The student actively selected among AI-proposed models (e.g., “edit A,” “Model1”), asked for targeted changes (e.g., changed “AI trainers” → “AI specialists”), and set priorities. However, the student accepted many suggestions with limited explicit critique of why a particular model was preferred beyond picking it. This indicates sound decision-making but only moderate explicit critical evaluation of alternative AI suggestions.
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - Evidence: Multiple meaningful revision cycles occurred: thesis revision, topic-sentence revision, three supporting-sentence iterations, closing sentence, proofreading and a final small wording tweak. The student used a clear iterative process and repeatedly asked for models and proofreading.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear engagement with the revision process: the student followed the assistant’s structured steps and made concrete choices (e.g., “edit A,” “Model1”).
- Effective incorporation of concrete examples: the student accepted and used specific job examples (“AI specialists, data analysts, and maintenance technicians”) that made the argument more concrete.
- Successful targeted revision: the selected paragraph was substantially improved in clarity, logical flow, and grammar after proofreading.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Finish revising remaining parts: opposing-view paragraph, introduction, and conclusion need the same level of revision and proofreading.
- Develop evidence depth: include stronger, more varied supporting evidence (statistics, brief real-world examples, or clearer causal explanation of how job creation scales).
- Increase independent critical edits: when accepting AI suggestions, add brief justifications or alternative options to deepen critical evaluation and learning.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student specified revision goals early (“make the essay answer the prompt clearly, strengthen the thesis, improve paragraph unity, fix grammar...”) and confirmed topic choice (Automation).
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student selected priorities (B and C) and followed a structured path; they also asked for specific micro-tasks.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good - The student selected and tweaked AI suggestions (e.g., changed “AI trainers” → “AI specialists”), but could add more explicit critique of suggestions to reach excellence.
- **Independent Editing**: Developing - The student pasted own sentences and accepted many models; more autonomous rewrites and justification of choices would strengthen this skill.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise remaining sections (introduction, opposing-view paragraph, and conclusion) with the same stepwise approach: restate the refined thesis, summarize two reasons clearly, and end with a strong implication or recommendation.
2. Add at least one concrete external example or statistic (even a brief, generic reference like “companies often hire data-annotation teams” with realistic numbers if available) to strengthen evidence and credibility.
3. Practice independent edits: when the AI offers models, try writing an alternative first, then compare and briefly note why you accept or modify the AI model to deepen critical evaluation.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student completed the three assigned revision tasks (thesis, topic sentence, body paragraph) and demonstrated effective engagement in an iterative human-AI workflow.
- The dialogue shows strong task focus and sustained effort; however, the essay’s introduction and conclusion still require instructor attention for alignment (the header mentions a different prompt) and for clarity.
- Recommend encouraging the student to: (a) complete the remaining proofreading pass across the essay, (b) practice justifying edits (short comments in the chat), and (c) ensure alignment with the assigned prompt (climate-change vs automation) if the assignment requires a specific topic.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
There is no denying that automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency has emerged as a critical challenge in today's world. I hold a strong stance that this technological shift ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term is the most responsible perspective, This essay will first acknowledge the opposing viewpoint and then delve into why it will enhance is a more convincing arguement.
On one side of the discussion, it is understandable That why some people argue that the technological shift undermine the global employment prospects due to practical or social considerations.A prominent explaination for this view is that AI now do some easy work like waiters, translators and help people to do some research.But AI can only do so much easier work. If they want to enhance the ability, it needs people to train them. Humane have brain knowledge and emotion. Al not alternative people to do things. they can only do some repetitive work.
However, my firm belief is that is technologioal shift is a chance for people to enhance abilities to learn some new things so that there can be more employment prospects to let people select. It provides a more sustainable solution to job reduce for two reason. Firstly people can use technology in work to make progress,Then study from them.So that, we will do the work better. Meanwhile,contrast to AI and human,human have emotion and we can use our brain to think, it makes the work has unique style.Jobs need human.Secondly, if AI want to be better than before, it needs more and more people to learn how to enhance them. So more position will appearance, the employment prospects will enhance ultimately.
To summarize, while there are valid arguments supporting The employment will be undermined. I firmly maintain that technological shift ultimately enhace themis the superior people, this perspective better address The root issues of approach. By emphasizing the improvement of technology needs reducing jobs while boosting efficiency while paving the way for long-term improvements.

There is no denying that automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency has emerged as a critical challenge in today’s world.

For example, companies that adopt AI need AI specialists to label data and guide machine-learning models, which creates paid positions in data annotation, model validation, and quality control. As companies adopt automation, they often invest in retraining programs that help existing workers become system operators or supervisors. This shifts employees into higher-skilled roles and expands job opportunities. Therefore, by creating specialized positions and enabling workers to acquire new skills, automation can increase both the number and quality of available jobs. To summarize, while there are valid arguments supporting The employment will be undermined.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:13:14.925Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on bla bla bla ...

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:14:38.491Z

**Assistant:** Nice — thanks for sharing your draft. Before we jump into revising, let’s do the agreed preliminary stage so we can focus our time where it will help the most.

1) Quick questions about your goals
- What are your top two or three goals for this revision session? (Examples: make the essay answer the prompt clearly, strengthen the thesis, improve paragraph unity, fix grammar and word choice, make examples clearer.)
- Do you want to respond to the given climate-change prompt (“individual actions vs governments/corporations”), or were you actually intending to keep the current topic about automation and employment? (Right now the draft is about automation, but the assignment prompt is about climate change — we must pick one.)

Tell me your answers to those two points and we’ll move on.

2) Short diagnostic reading (rubric-based)
I’ve read your draft and here’s a concise diagnosis using the rubric categories:

- Thesis & Argument
  Strengths: You state a clear position (you think the technological shift will ultimately improve employment prospects).
  Areas to improve: The thesis is unclear and grammatically confused; it doesn’t neatly answer a clear prompt and doesn’t preview your main reasons in a concise way.

- Organization
  Strengths: You attempt the classic structure (acknowledge opposing view, then support your view).
  Areas to improve: Transitions and logical ordering are weak; some sentences don’t connect clearly to the paragraph main idea; the conclusion is repetitive and unclear.

- Evidence & Development
  Strengths: You try to use reasoning (AI needs people to train it; humans have emotion and creativity).
  Areas to improve: Claims are vague and need clearer examples and explanations; reasoning often skips steps (e.g., how training AI creates concrete jobs — what jobs? where?).

- Language Use (grammar, vocabulary, clarity)
  Strengths: Your voice and stance come through — you’re trying to persuade.
  Areas to improve: Many grammar, word-choice, and sentence-formation errors make meaning hard to follow. Sentences need simplification and proofing for correctness.

Big-picture issue to fix first: the essay currently does not match the prompt in the file header (climate-change individual vs. governments) — decide which topic you must write on. If the assignment requires the climate-change prompt, we must refocus the whole essay. If your assignment is actually about automation, we’ll continue with that topic but should correct alignment in the header.

3) Student priority selection
Which of these would you like to focus on in this session? Pick up to two priorities.
- A. Aligning the essay to the correct prompt (urgent)
- B. Writing a clear, strong thesis that previews the main points
- C. Strengthening one topic sentence so it ties to the thesis
- D. Improving unity and clarity in one body paragraph (supporting sentences & evidence)
- E. Grammar and sentence-level fixes in that paragraph

Please pick the priorities (for example: “B and D”) and confirm whether we should keep the automation topic or change to the climate-change prompt. Once you confirm, we’ll start Step 1 (thesis revision).

Optional: If you’d like to “pretend we already revised the thesis” and move on, say so — but first confirm which topic you want (automation or climate-change) and which priorities you chose. If you want, I can propose a candidate thesis for you to accept or edit before we continue.

Your move — which topic, and which 1–2 priorities?

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:15:41.635Z

**You:** make the essay answer the prompt clearly, strengthen the thesis, improve paragraph unity, fix grammar and word choice, make examples clearer.

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:16:48.239Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for that clear list of goals. A couple quick clarifying choices so we can focus our time well.

1) Topic: Do you want to keep the current automation/employment topic, or do you need to switch and answer the climate-change prompt in the header? (Pick one: Automation or Climate-change.)

2) Priorities (pick up to two)
You asked for many improvements; to keep the work manageable and focused for this session, please choose two of these to focus on now:
- A. Align essay to correct prompt (urgent)
- B. Strong, clear thesis that previews main points
- C. Strengthen one topic sentence so it ties to the thesis
- D. Improve unity and clarity in one body paragraph (supporting sentences & evidence)
- E. Grammar and word-choice fixes in that paragraph

My recommendation (based on your goals and the draft): choose B (thesis) and D (paragraph unity). We can also address some grammar and word choice as part of revising that paragraph, so you get many of your goals met.

3) Quick diagnosis (short & focused)
- Thesis & Argument: Your position is clear (automation will ultimately increase employment), but the thesis is grammatically confused and doesn’t preview clear reasons.
- Organization: You use a counterargument + response structure — good — but connections and transitions are weak.
- Evidence & Development: Reasons are promising (AI needs trainers; humans have unique skills) but vague — give concrete examples and explain how jobs appear.
- Language Use: Many grammar and word-choice errors make ideas hard to follow; sentences need simplification.

Next step
Please reply with:
- Your choice of topic (Automation or Climate-change).
- Your two chosen priorities (for example: “B and D”).
- Which body paragraph you’d like to work on (I suggest the paragraph that starts “However, my firm belief…” — is that okay?).
- Paste the current thesis statement you want to revise (you can use the one from your draft or ask me to propose a candidate).

Once you confirm those, we’ll begin Step 1: revise the thesis. Would you like me to propose a model thesis for you to edit, or would you prefer to revise the thesis yourself after my feedback?

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:17:06.930Z

**You:** 1.Automation 2.BC 3.confirm

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:25:11.347Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming. We’ll keep the automation topic and focus on B (strong, clear thesis) and C (one topic sentence). I’ll work with the body paragraph that begins “However, my firm belief…” — is that still the paragraph you want to revise? (I’ll assume yes unless you tell me otherwise.)

Step 1 — Thesis statement revision

1) Please paste the exact sentence you want to use as your thesis (you can copy it from your draft). If you prefer, I can work from the messy sentence already in your draft; just say “use the draft thesis.”

2) Quick feedback on the draft thesis (short and clear):
- What’s good: your position is clear — you think automation will ultimately improve employment prospects.
- What to fix: the sentence is grammatically confused, long, and doesn’t clearly preview your main reasons. It also contains hedging and repetition. A strong thesis should (a) directly answer the question, (b) state your position confidently, and (c) preview two clear reasons you will develop.

3) Would you like to try revising the thesis yourself now, or would you like me to propose a candidate thesis you can edit? If you want a model, here’s one concise option you can copy or change:
- “Although automation will eliminate some jobs in the short term, I believe it will ultimately increase employment by creating new technology-related roles and by enabling workers to move into higher-skilled, more productive positions.”

Try one of these:
- Paste your current thesis, OR
- Edit the model I gave, OR
- Ask me for a second model with different reasons.

Once you post your revised thesis, I’ll give brief feedback and we’ll confirm it before moving to Step 2. Which would you like to do?

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:25:35.550Z

**You:** I hold a strong stance that this technological shift ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term is the most responsible perspective,

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:26:43.466Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — that’s a useful draft to work from. A couple quick clarifying questions before we revise: do you want to keep the automation/employment topic (yes/no)? And do you want to focus on the thesis plus one topic sentence (that was your earlier choice B and C)?

Meanwhile, quick feedback on this thesis you pasted:
"I hold a strong stance that this technological shift ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term is the most responsible perspective,"

- What’s good: it shows a clear position (you think automation will improve employment).
- What to fix: the sentence is grammatically incorrect and confusing (run-on, verb form problems), contains hedging/extra phrasing, and doesn’t preview clear reasons you will develop.

Would you like to try revising it yourself now, or would you prefer a model to edit? Try to make the thesis: (1) direct and confident, (2) answer the question, and (3) preview two clear reasons.

Here are two model options you can copy or edit:

Model A (explicit preview):
"Although automation will eliminate some jobs in the short term, I believe it will ultimately increase employment by creating new technology-related roles and by enabling workers to move into higher-skilled, more productive positions."

Model B (concise):
"While automation may displace routine work, it will ultimately expand employment by generating new tech jobs and allowing workers to shift into more creative, higher-paid roles."

Which would you like to use or edit? Or post your own revised sentence and I’ll give quick feedback. Once you’re happy with the thesis, we’ll move to Step 2 (the topic sentence for the paragraph you picked).

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:27:16.104Z

**You:** yes

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:47:34.143Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — quick clarification before we begin: when you said “yes,” did you mean you want to

- Keep the automation/employment topic (not switch to climate change), and
- Focus on a stronger thesis (B) and one topic sentence (C), working on the paragraph that begins “However, my firm belief…”?

If yes, paste the exact thesis sentence you want to revise (you can copy it from your draft), or type “use draft thesis.” Or, if you prefer, pick one of these short model theses to edit:

Model A (explicit preview)
- Although automation will eliminate some jobs in the short term, I believe it will ultimately increase employment by creating new technology-related roles and by enabling workers to move into higher-skilled, more productive positions.

Model B (concise)
- While automation may displace routine work, it will ultimately expand employment by generating new tech jobs and allowing workers to shift into more creative, higher-paid roles.

Which would you like to do?
- I’ll try revising the thesis myself (and paste it here).
- I’ll edit Model A or Model B (say “edit A” or “edit B”).
- Use the draft thesis (type “use draft thesis”).
Once you post/confirm the thesis, I’ll give quick feedback and then we’ll move to Step 2 (the topic sentence).

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:47:50.138Z

**You:** edit A

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:49:27.776Z

**Assistant:** Nice choice — editing Model A gives us a clear, previewing thesis to work with.

Brief feedback on the edited thesis I created from Model A:
- Strengths: It answers the question directly, states your position confidently, and previews two clear reasons you can develop (new tech roles; workers moving into higher-skilled jobs).
- Next step: Check that the rest of your introduction and each body paragraph clearly link to those two reasons (we’ll do that in Step 2 and 3).

Here’s the full essay with the thesis sentence replaced by the edited Model A you chose. (I only changed the thesis sentence; the rest of the draft is left as you wrote it so we can revise it in the next steps.)

Quick check:
- Are you happy with this thesis sentence as written, or would you like to tweak its wording? (If you want a small change, say what feels off — e.g., “make it shorter,” or “mention AI trainers as an example.”)
- If you’re happy, we’ll move to Step 2. Please paste the exact topic sentence from the paragraph you want to work on (I’ll assume it’s the paragraph that begins “However, my firm belief…” unless you tell me otherwise). Would you like to try revising that topic sentence now, or would you like me to suggest a model topic sentence you can edit?

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:50:42.171Z

**You:** my firm belief is that is technologioal shift is a chance for people to enhance abilities to learn some new things so that there can be more employment prospects to let people select.

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:52:34.857Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that topic sentence already shows your position and purpose. Let’s make it clearer and tie it directly to your thesis.

Quick, focused feedback
- Strengths: It signals a shift (contrast to the opposing view) and asserts a positive outcome (chance for people to learn).
- Problems to fix: grammar and typos, wordiness, and vague phrasing. It doesn’t clearly connect to the two reasons in your thesis (creating new tech roles; workers moving into higher-skilled jobs).

Concrete, small edits you can apply (don’t write them all at once — pick the changes you like)
- Capitalize and fix the start: change “my firm belief is that is technologioal shift” → “My firm belief is that this technological shift…”
- Replace “enhance abilities to learn some new things” → “enables people to learn new skills” or “helps workers upskill”
- Replace “so that there can be more employment prospects to let people select” → “creating more employment opportunities” or “giving people more job options”
- Add a brief link to the thesis reasons: include phrases like “by creating new technology roles” and/or “by allowing workers to move into higher-skilled work.”

A short template to follow (fill the brackets)
- [Transition], [main claim about opportunity], because/by [reason 1] and [reason 2].
- Example fragments to plug in: transition = “However,” or “Nevertheless,” ; reason 1 = “creating new technology-related roles”; reason 2 = “helping workers move into higher-skilled, more productive positions.”

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now using those edits and the template? Paste your new sentence and I’ll give quick feedback. If you prefer, I can also show 1–2 model sentences — say so and I’ll provide them.

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:52:55.102Z

**You:** I prefer

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:53:46.828Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — quick check: do you mean you prefer to try revising the topic sentence yourself? 

If yes, please paste your revised topic sentence here and I’ll give brief, focused feedback and suggestions.

If you’d rather see 1–2 model topic sentences to edit, reply “show models” and I’ll provide them for you to adapt.

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:53:53.900Z

**You:** show models

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:54:19.790Z

**Assistant:** Great — here are two short model topic sentences you can choose from or adapt. Each one ties clearly to your revised thesis (new tech roles + workers moving into higher-skilled jobs).

Model 1 (focus on new tech roles)
- "However, I believe this technological shift will expand employment by creating new technology-related roles, such as AI trainers, data analysts, and maintenance technicians."

Why this works: it names concrete job types, which makes your claim easier to support in the paragraph.

Model 2 (focus on upskilling/work shifts)
- "However, I believe automation offers workers the chance to upskill and move into higher-skilled, more productive positions, which will increase overall employment opportunities."

Why this works: it connects directly to the idea of workers shifting into better jobs and sets up explanations/examples about training and career change.

Which do you prefer? Try copying one and making a small change (or combining them), then paste your revised topic sentence here. Once you post it, we’ll give quick feedback and move on to revising the rest of that paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:54:37.177Z

**You:** However, I believe this technological shift will expand employment by creating new technology-related roles, such as AI trainers, data analysts, and maintenance technicians.

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:55:23.057Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that topic sentence is a clear improvement: it links directly to your thesis and names concrete job types you can explain. Well done!

Quick feedback (very short)
- Strengths: It ties to the thesis (new tech roles) and gives specific examples (AI trainers, data analysts, maintenance technicians). That makes the paragraph easier to develop.
- One small thing to watch: be sure the rest of the paragraph explains exactly how those jobs appear and how they increase overall employment (cause → effect).

Next step (Step 3) — revise the rest of that paragraph
I want you to try editing the supporting sentences now. Below are focused guidance steps and micro-prompts to help—please try one sentence and paste it here. I’ll give quick feedback and then we’ll continue.

Guiding plan (three quick moves)
1) Explain the mechanism for one job example
   - Starter fragments you can use (not full sentences): "For example, AI trainers are needed because…" or "For instance, companies hire data analysts to…"  
   - Aim: say who hires them, what they do, and why that creates paid positions.

2) Add a short link to the larger effect
   - Use a linking phrase: "As a result, …" or "This means that …"  
   - Aim: show how one job type creates more employment (direct hires, support roles, new services).

3) End the paragraph with a sentence that ties back to the topic sentence
   - Starter fragment: "Together, these roles increase employment by…" or "Therefore, automation can expand the job market because…"

Hints on common problems to fix as you edit
- Combine short fragments into complete sentences. Watch capitalization and punctuation.
- Replace vague words (things like "enhance" or "better") with specific verbs: create, require, hire, train, support.
- Be explicit about the link: say how training, maintenance, or data work leads to paid jobs and opportunities for workers to upskill.

A very small example of a starter (I’m giving a fragment you can finish):
- "For example, companies need AI trainers to label data and teach models, so they hire specialists who…" (finish with the job effect)

Your task now
- Revise the first supporting sentence in that paragraph (the one right after your new topic sentence). Paste just that sentence here. Try to show who hires, what the job does, and why it exists.

When you paste your sentence, I’ll give brief feedback and then help you revise the next supporting sentence. Also — because you made a concrete change — I’ve included the full essay below with your topic sentence inserted so you can see the current version in context.

Full essay with your updated topic sentence (only thesis and topic sentence changed; other text left as draft):

There is no denying that automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency has emerged as a critical challenge in today's world. Although automation will eliminate some jobs in the short term, I believe it will ultimately increase employment by creating new technology-related roles and enabling workers to move into higher-skilled, more productive positions. This essay will first acknowledge the opposing viewpoint and then delve into why it will enhance is a more convincing arguement.
On one side of the discussion, it is understandable That why some people argue that the technological shift undermine the global employment prospects due to practical or social considerations.A prominent explaination for this view is that AI now do some easy work like waiters, translators and help people to do some research.But AI can only do so much easier work. If they want to enhance the ability, it needs people to train them. Humane have brain knowledge and emotion. Al not alternative people to do things. they can only do some repetitive work.
However, I believe this technological shift will expand employment by creating new technology-related roles, such as AI trainers, data analysts, and maintenance technicians. It provides a more sustainable solution to job reduce for two reason. Firstly people can use technology in work to make progress,Then study from them.So that, we will do the work better. Meanwhile,contrast to AI and human,human have emotion and we can use our brain to think, it makes the work has unique style.Jobs need human.Secondly, if AI want to be better than before, it needs more and more people to learn how to enhance them. So more position will appearance, the employment prospects will enhance ultimately.
To summarize, while there are valid arguments supporting The employment will be undermined. I firmly maintain that technological shift ultimately enhace themis the superior people, this perspective better address The root issues of approach. By emphasizing the improvement of technology needs reducing jobs while boosting efficiency while paving the way for long-term improvements.

Go ahead — paste your revised first supporting sentence for the paragraph (one sentence). I’ll respond with brief, focused feedback and the next small step.

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:56:04.218Z

**You:** It provides a more sustainable solution to job reduce for two reason. Firstly people can use technology in work to make progress,Then study from them.So that, we will do the work better. Meanwhile,contrast to AI and human,human have emotion and we can use our brain to think, it makes the work has unique style.Jobs need human.Secondly, if AI want to be better than before, it needs more and more people to learn how to enhance them. So more position will appearance, the employment prospects will enhance ultimately.

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:56:58.273Z

**Assistant:** Good progress — your topic sentence is strong now. Let’s focus on making the supporting sentences clearer, one step at a time.

Brief, focused feedback on the paragraph you pasted
- What’s working: You try to give two reasons (people can use technology to improve, and AI development creates jobs). The paragraph wants to explain the mechanisms — that’s exactly what we need here.
- Main problems to fix: grammar (e.g., “job reduce,” “for two reason,” run-on sentences), unclear phrasing, and missing logical links (who hires whom, what tasks, how that creates jobs).

Small plan — rewrite one sentence at a time
- Task right now: revise the first supporting sentence after your topic sentence. Make it show reason 1 clearly: who benefits or hires, what they do, and why that creates work.

Useful revision tips (pick one or two to use)
- Replace vague phrases: “job reduce” → “job losses” or “loss of jobs.”
- Use a clear subject: start with “For example, companies…” or “First,” or “Firstly,” to signal reason 1.
- Show cause → effect: say who hires and what they do, then add “so” / “thus” / “as a result” to show how that creates jobs.

Three short starter-fragments you can finish (these are prompts, not full sentences)
1) “For example, companies hire AI trainers to label data and adjust models, so these firms need paid specialists who…” (finish with how that creates employment)
2) “First, automation increases demand for technical roles such as data analysts and maintenance technicians because…” (explain what they do and why firms hire them)
3) “Firstly, as businesses adopt AI, they must employ people to build, monitor, and maintain systems; this creates jobs in…” (list or describe job types briefly)

Your next step
- Try revising just the first supporting sentence now (one complete sentence). Paste your sentence here and I’ll give quick, focused feedback. If you prefer that I show a model sentence first, say “show model” and I’ll provide one for you to adapt.

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:57:14.158Z

**You:** show model

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:57:54.555Z

**Assistant:** Great — nice move asking for models. Below are three short model sentences you can use as the paragraph’s first supporting sentence. Each one shows who does the hiring, what they do, and why those roles exist.

Model 1 (concrete, tech jobs named)
- For example, companies hiring AI systems need AI trainers to label data and guide machine-learning models, which creates paid positions in data annotation, model validation, and quality control.

Model 2 (broader, specialist roles)
- Firstly, as businesses implement automation, they must employ specialists—such as data analysts, software engineers, and maintenance technicians—to build, monitor, and repair these systems, generating new job opportunities.

Model 3 (focus on retraining/upskilling)
- For instance, many workers will need retraining to manage and collaborate with automated systems, which increases demand for trainers, instructors, and technical support staff in both companies and education providers.

Which one do you prefer? Try copying one and making a small change if you like — then paste it here. If you’d rather, say “use Model 2” and I’ll insert it into the paragraph and show the full essay with that change.

Because you asked for a model and to help you see it in context, here is the full essay with Model 1 inserted as the first supporting sentence after your topic sentence (I only changed the thesis, the topic sentence, and this one supporting sentence so we can revise step-by-step):

Your turn — which model do you want to use or adapt? Paste your preferred sentence (or a revised version) and I’ll give quick feedback and then help with the next supporting sentence.

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:58:16.108Z

**You:** Model1

*Time:* 2025-11-23T09:59:35.821Z

**Assistant:** Great choice — Model 1 is concrete and makes the paragraph easier to develop. Nice move.

Quick feedback on that sentence
- Strength: It names specific roles and shows a clear mechanism (companies need people to train and validate AI), which supports your topic sentence well.
- One small tip as you continue: keep sentences complete and connect each one back to the topic sentence with link words (For example, As a result, Therefore).

Because you chose Model 1, here is the full essay with that sentence inserted (I only changed the thesis, the topic sentence, and this one supporting sentence so we can revise step-by-step):

Next step — supporting sentence 2 (your turn)
Now please try revising the next supporting sentence (the one after the Model 1 sentence). That sentence should develop your second reason from the thesis: explain how workers can upskill or move into higher-skilled roles, and show how that increases employment overall.

You can try writing one sentence that:
- explains who provides the training or how workers learn new skills (companies, training programs, colleges),
- describes the kinds of higher-skilled jobs they move into (developers, supervisors, system managers, etc.), and
- links that to the bigger effect (more job opportunities, higher wages, broader employment).

If you want a model to adapt, pick one to edit or copy and then paste your version:

Model A (upskilling + employers)
- As companies adopt automation, they often invest in retraining programs so that existing workers can become system operators or supervisors, which shifts employees into higher-skilled roles and expands job opportunities.

Model B (education + new roles)
- In many cases, training programs at colleges and private providers prepare workers for roles like software support and systems management, creating a steady demand for skilled employees.

Model C (combined effect)
- As a result, retraining and new educational programs help workers move from routine tasks into technical or managerial positions, increasing both the number and quality of available jobs.

Your task: try one sentence now (paste it here). I’ll give quick, focused feedback and then we’ll finish the paragraph with a closing sentence that ties everything back to the thesis.

Would you like a hint for specific vocabulary to use (e.g., retrain, upskill, system operator, supervisor, data annotation, maintenance)?

*Time:* 2025-11-23T10:00:00.660Z

**You:** ModelA

*Time:* 2025-11-23T10:01:19.623Z

**Assistant:** Great — nice choice. Model A is a clear, useful sentence that links automation adoption to retraining and higher-skilled roles.

Quick feedback on your chosen sentence (short):
- Strength: It explains who does the retraining (companies) and describes the result (workers move into higher-skilled roles), which supports your thesis well.
- Tiny suggestion: consider tightening wording a little (e.g., “system operators or supervisors” → “system operators and supervisors”) and keep the sentence as a step toward a closing sentence that shows the bigger effect (“Therefore…” or “As a result…”).

Because you chose Model A, I’ve inserted it into your paragraph. Below is the full essay with the thesis, the improved topic sentence, the first supporting sentence (model 1), and your chosen Model A as the next supporting sentence. I changed only those parts so we can continue step-by-step.

Next small step (Step 3 continued) — closing sentence for this paragraph
Now try writing the paragraph’s final sentence: it should tie the examples back to the topic sentence and to the thesis (show how the new roles and upskilling increase employment overall).

Would you like to:
- Try writing that closing sentence yourself now? (Great — paste it and I’ll give brief feedback.)
- Or see 1–2 model closing sentences to edit? (If so, say “show models” and I’ll give two short options.)

If you’d like a quick hint for vocabulary to use in that closing sentence: use phrases such as “As a result,” “Therefore,” “This shows that,” “Together,” and verbs like “expand,” “increase,” “create,” “raise,” or “open.”

Your call — try writing the closing sentence, or say “show models.”

*Time:* 2025-11-23T10:01:56.166Z

**You:** show models

*Time:* 2025-11-23T10:02:34.639Z

**Assistant:** Good — here are two short model closing sentences you can adapt. Each one links the paragraph back to your topic sentence and the thesis.

Model 1
- "As a result, these new technical roles and retraining programs help replace routine jobs and expand overall employment opportunities."

Why it works: it shows cause → effect (roles + retraining replace/offset losses) and signals a broad increase in jobs.

Model 2
- "Therefore, by creating specialized positions and enabling workers to upskill, automation can increase both the number and quality of available jobs."

Why it works: it ties both ideas (new roles + upskilling) to two outcomes (more jobs and better jobs), matching your thesis preview.

Your turn — pick one to adapt or write your own closing sentence and paste it here. I’ll give a quick, focused suggestion and then we’ll finish polishing the paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-23T10:03:03.371Z

**You:** Model2

*Time:* 2025-11-23T10:03:28.371Z

**Assistant:** Nice choice — Model 2 is a clear, strong closing sentence and it ties the paragraph back to your thesis well.

Brief feedback on the closing sentence
- Strengths: It links the two reasons from your thesis (specialized positions + upskilling) and states the combined effect (more and better jobs). Good move — concise and focused.
- Small tip if you want to refine later: you could replace "enable workers to upskill" with "help workers upskill" for slightly simpler phrasing. But it already works well.

I’ve inserted that closing sentence into your paragraph and included the full essay below (I only changed the thesis sentence, the topic sentence, the two supporting sentences we worked on, and the closing sentence of that paragraph). Read it and tell me if you’re happy with these changes or if you want to tweak wording before we move on to the next step (grammar, sentence-level edits, or a different paragraph).

Next choices — what would you like to do now?
- Keep these wording choices and move to focused grammar and sentence-level fixes for this paragraph (E), or
- Tweak any phrase in the thesis/topic sentence/closing sentence (small wording changes), or
- Move to another paragraph (e.g., improve the opposing-view paragraph), or
- Stop for now.

Which would you like? (If you want grammar fixes for this paragraph, I’ll edit only that paragraph’s sentences for clarity, correctness, and punctuation.)

*Time:* 2025-11-23T10:03:46.964Z

**You:** A

*Time:* 2025-11-23T10:04:53.321Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I’ll take “A” to mean: do focused grammar and sentence-level fixes for the body paragraph we worked on (the paragraph that begins “However, I believe…”). I made only grammatical and clarity edits inside that paragraph (no new ideas), and I left the rest of your draft unchanged so we can continue step-by-step.

What I changed (very briefly)
- Corrected punctuation, capitalization, and sentence structure in the chosen paragraph.
- Smoothed sentence links (used clearer connectors like “this” and semicolons) so each sentence shows cause → effect.
- Kept your examples and logic unchanged (AI trainers, retraining, upskilling), only made wording clearer.

Here is the full essay with that paragraph edited:

Would you like to
- Review that paragraph and ask for one small wording change? (I can tweak a word or two.)
- Move next to fixing grammar and clarity in the opposing-view paragraph (the one beginning “On one side…”), or
- Work on polishing the introduction or conclusion next?

Pick one and I’ll guide the next small step.

*Time:* 2025-11-23T10:05:45.131Z

**You:** Work on polishing the conclusion

*Time:* 2025-11-23T10:06:58.170Z

**Assistant:** Good — polishing the conclusion is a useful next step. Before I edit anything, let’s renegotiate the target so we stay focused and make the most of our time.

1) Quick confirmation
- Do you want to change your session priorities so I work on the conclusion now instead of (or in addition to) the paragraph we already revised? (Reply: “Yes, switch to conclusion” or “No, keep current focus.”)

2) Short diagnostic feedback on your current conclusion
(From the draft’s final paragraph.)

- Strengths
  - You attempt to restate your position and show the essay’s overall message.
  - You try to address the idea of long-term improvement.

- Areas to improve (high priority)
  - Clarity: sentences are confusing and sometimes ungrammatical, which hides your meaning.
  - Structure: the paragraph doesn’t clearly restate the thesis, summarize the two main reasons, and end with a strong closing thought.
  - Repetition and word-choice: phrases like “enhace themis the superior people” and “needs reducing jobs while boosting efficiency while paving the way” are unclear and repetitive.
  - Tone: avoid hedging and vague language — state the conclusion confidently and succinctly.

3) Pick a micro-goal for the conclusion (choose one)
- A. Make the conclusion grammatically correct and clearer.
- B. Make the conclusion restate the thesis and briefly summarize the two reasons.
- C. Tighten the final sentence so it leaves a strong impression/implication.
Pick one (for example: “B and C”).

4) How would you like to proceed?
- Option 1 (recommended): Try revising the conclusion yourself now. I’ll give brief feedback and then, if you want me to apply the changes, I’ll insert them and provide the full revised essay.
- Option 2: If you prefer, I can propose a short version for you to edit — but I encourage you to try first.

5) Quick guidance and a three-sentence template you can use to revise (fill in the brackets)
(Please try to write one attempt using this template; don’t worry about perfect grammar — I’ll help.)

- Sentence 1 (restate thesis confidently): “Although automation may remove some routine jobs in the short term, I firmly believe it will ultimately [brief thesis claim].” 
  - Example phrase to finish: “increase employment by creating new technology-related roles and helping workers move into higher-skilled, more productive positions.”

- Sentence 2 (summarize main reasons in one line): “This is because automation creates specialized roles (for example, AI trainers and data analysts) and prompts retraining so workers can shift into higher-skilled occupations.”
  - Keep it concise — one sentence, two reasons.

- Sentence 3 (final thought / implication): “Therefore, rather than fearing automation, policymakers and companies should focus on training and job creation to ensure the transition benefits workers in the long term.”
  - You can change the implication (policy advice, hopeful note, or warning), but make it direct.

Your task now
- Confirm whether you want me to switch focus to the conclusion (yes/no) and pick a micro-goal (A, B, or C, or a combination).
- Then either: paste your own revised conclusion (using the template if you like), or say “Please show a model” if you want me to propose a sample conclusion for you to edit.

I’ll wait for your choice and then give quick, focused feedback or produce the requested edit. You’re doing well — just a clear, three-sentence close will make your essay much stronger.

**Assistant:** Nice — thanks for pasting your conclusion. Quick note about scope: in this session we’ve been focusing on the thesis and one body paragraph. I can continue with that plan, or we can renegotiate and focus on the conclusion instead. Before I revise anything, we need to confirm that change of focus.

A. Quick confirmation questions
1) Do you want to switch our session focus to the conclusion now? (Reply: “Yes — conclude” or “No — keep paragraph work”.)
2) Keep the automation topic? (Yes/No)

B. Short diagnostic reading of your pasted conclusion (rubric-based)
- Thesis & Argument
  Strength: You try to restate your position.
  Needs work: The thesis is unclear and ungrammatical; it doesn’t cleanly restate your revised thesis or summarize the two main reasons.

- Organization
  Strength: You attempt to summarize and conclude.
  Needs work: Sentences are disordered and repetitive; the paragraph does not follow the usual conclusion structure (restate thesis → summarize reasons → final comment).

- Evidence & Development
  Strength: You attempt to mention long-term improvement.
  Needs work: Reasoning is vague and phrasing is confusing; you don’t clearly link back to the specific reasons (new tech roles; upskilling).

- Language Use (grammar, vocabulary, clarity)
  Needs work: Many grammar, punctuation, and word-choice errors make the meaning hard to follow. Sentences need to be rewritten for clarity and concision.

C. Suggested micro-goals — pick one (or two)
- A. Make the conclusion grammatically correct and clearer.
- B. Restate the thesis and briefly summarize the two main reasons.
- C. Tighten the final sentence to leave a clear implication or recommendation.

Tell me which you want (for example: “B and C”) and confirm whether we should switch focus to the conclusion.

D. If you want to rewrite the conclusion now — a three-sentence template you can use
(You can paste your attempt, or ask me to propose a model.)
1) Restate thesis confidently: “Although automation may remove some routine jobs in the short term, I firmly believe it will ultimately [brief thesis claim].”
2) Summarize reasons: “This is because automation creates specialized roles (for example, AI trainers and data analysts) and encourages retraining so workers can move into higher-skilled positions.”
3) Final thought / implication: “Therefore, policymakers and companies should support training and job-creation programs so workers benefit from the shift.”

E. Your next step
- Reply with: (1) “Yes” or “No” to switching focus to the conclusion, (2) pick micro-goals (A/B/C), and (3) say whether you want to try writing the conclusion yourself using the template or want me to propose a model for you to edit.

When you reply, I’ll give brief feedback and—if you ask me to—produce a revised conclusion or insert it into the full essay. You’re doing good work; a clear, three-sentence close will make your whole essay much stronger. Which option do you choose?

*Time:* 2025-11-23T10:08:33.067Z

**You:** 1.no 2.yes

*Time:* 2025-11-23T10:09:41.969Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming. We’ll keep working on the automation topic and stay focused on the thesis + the single body paragraph we revised (no conclusion work).

Quick checkpoint: are you satisfied with the current thesis and the revised paragraph we edited? If not, pick one small, concrete next step from the list below so I can help right away. (Choose one option or type your own.)

Options — pick one:
1) Tweak the thesis wording (make it shorter or add a concrete example like “AI trainers”) — say “Thesis: shorter” or “Thesis: add example.”
2) Make one small wording change inside the paragraph (choose which sentence: topic sentence / first support / second support / closing sentence) — e.g., “Change topic sentence” or “Change closing sentence.”
3) Do one more focused grammar/proofread pass on that paragraph (fix remaining commas, capitals, small errors) — say “Proofread paragraph.”
4) I’m done with this paragraph; show full revised essay as it stands — say “Show full essay.”
5) Other (type a short instruction).

Which do you want to do? You can reply with the option number and any brief detail (for example: “1 — Thesis: add ‘AI trainers’” or “3 — Proofread paragraph”). I’ll make only that change and then paste the full revised essay back for you to check.

*Time:* 2025-11-23T10:09:54.478Z

**You:** Proofread paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-23T10:11:19.485Z

**Assistant:** Done — I proofread the paragraph you asked for. I made small, focused edits for grammar, punctuation, and clarity (fixed wording like “companies adopting AI” → “companies that adopt AI,” replaced a semicolon with clearer sentence breaks, and smoothed the final sentence). I left your other paragraphs as they were so we can continue step-by-step.

Here is the full essay with only that body paragraph proofread:

There is no denying that automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency has emerged as a critical challenge in today's world. Although automation will eliminate some jobs in the short term, I believe it will ultimately increase employment by creating new technology-related roles and enabling workers to move into higher-skilled, more productive positions. This essay will first acknowledge the opposing viewpoint and then delve into why it will enhance is a more convincing arguement.
On one side of the discussion, it is understandable That why some people argue that the technological shift undermine the global employment prospects due to practical or social considerations.A prominent explaination for this view is that AI now do some easy work like waiters, translators and help people to do some research.But AI can only do so much easier work. If they want to enhance the ability, it needs people to train them. Humane have brain knowledge and emotion. Al not alternative people to do things. they can only do some repetitive work.
However, I believe this technological shift will expand employment by creating new technology-related roles, such as AI trainers, data analysts, and maintenance technicians. For example, companies that adopt AI need AI trainers to label data and guide machine-learning models, which creates paid positions in data annotation, model validation, and quality control. As companies adopt automation, they often invest in retraining programs that help existing workers become system operators or supervisors. This shifts employees into higher-skilled roles and expands job opportunities. Therefore, by creating specialized positions and enabling workers to acquire new skills, automation can increase both the number and quality of available jobs.
To summarize, while there are valid arguments supporting The employment will be undermined. I firmly maintain that technological shift ultimately enhace themis the superior people, this perspective better address The root issues of approach. By emphasizing the improvement of technology needs reducing jobs while boosting efficiency while paving the way for long-term improvements.

Would you like me to:
- make one small wording tweak in that paragraph (e.g., change “AI trainers” to “AI specialists”), or
- move next to proofreading the opposing-view paragraph, or
- work on tightening the introduction or conclusion?

Pick one and I’ll make only that change.

*Time:* 2025-11-23T10:11:47.322Z

**You:** make one small wording tweak in that paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-23T10:12:43.660Z

**Assistant:** Good choice — a single, specific tweak keeps the paragraph natural while improving precision.

I changed “AI trainers” to “AI specialists” in that paragraph (both places it appeared). “AI specialists” feels slightly broader and more professional, which helps your examples sound more convincing without changing your ideas.

Here is the full essay with that one wording tweak applied:

Would you like another small tweak in that paragraph (for example, changing “system operators or supervisors” to “system operators and supervisors,” or simplifying a sentence), or shall we move to proofreading the opposing-view paragraph or the introduction/conclusion next?

*Time:* 2025-11-23T10:13:00.255Z

**You:** no thank you

*Time:* 2025-11-23T10:13:16.230Z

**Assistant:** You're welcome — great work today. You made clear choices and we revised the thesis and one body paragraph step by step. If you’re finished for now, that’s fine — you can return anytime for more edits.

Quick recap of what we did:
- Clarified and replaced the thesis with a clear, previewing sentence.
- Revised the paragraph that begins “However, I believe…”: we rewrote the topic sentence, added concrete supporting sentences (naming roles and explaining retraining), and finished with a clear closing sentence.
- Proofread that paragraph for grammar and clarity and made one wording tweak (changed “AI trainers” to “AI specialists”).

If you want to continue later, possible next steps are:
- Proofread and fix grammar in the rest of the essay (especially the opposing-view paragraph, intro, and conclusion).
- Tighten the introduction and conclusion to match the revised thesis.
- Check vocabulary and sentence-level clarity across the whole essay.

Below is the full revised essay as it stands (I only changed the thesis and the body paragraph we worked on; the rest of the draft is left as you wrote it):
