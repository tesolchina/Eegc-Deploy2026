            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your paragraph. Here’s a focused comment to help you improve it:

**Strengths:**
- The paragraph clearly focuses on the need to protect migrant workers.
- It identifies key problems faced by migrant workers: exploitation, long working hours, and low wages.
- It suggests concrete policy ideas like minimum wages and limits on working hours.

**Areas to improve:**

1. **Topic Sentence:**
   - Make it stronger and more specific to set the tone for the paragraph. For example, use “Governments must ensure migrant workers’ basic labor rights” to clearly state your claim and preview the problems you will discuss.

2. **Unity & Logical Flow:**
   - There is some repetition (the paragraph states weak regulations cause vulnerability more than once).
   - Reorder sentences into a logical flow: describe the problem → explain consequences → present solutions.
   - Clarify the sentence about illegal migration by specifying what “serious problems” arise (e.g., greater exploitation, lack of legal protection).

3. **Clarity & Development:**
   - Explain briefly why minimum wages and limits on working hours help reduce exploitation.
   - Add a brief example or reasoning to support how these policies protect migrant workers.

4. **Grammar & Word Choice:**
   - Fix punctuation (missing period after “migrant workers” in the first sentence).
   - Replace informal or unclear phrases:
     - “lowest line of hourly wages” → “minimum hourly wage”
     - “rule the working time per day” → “set limits on daily working hours”
     - “minority of the society” → “a vulnerable group” or simply “migrant workers, who are often vulnerable”
   - Choose either British (labour) or American (labor) spelling and use consistently.
   - Combine short sentences to improve flow and formality.

---

**Suggested revision (example):**

“Governments must ensure migrant workers’ basic labor rights because weak regulations leave them vulnerable to exploitation, excessive working hours, and unfairly low wages. This is a widespread issue worldwide, partly because many migrant workers lack legal protections in their host countries. Additionally, some migrate illegally, which increases their risk of abuse and exclusion from workplace safeguards. Therefore, governments should implement laws such as a minimum hourly wage and limits on daily working hours to protect this vulnerable group’s fundamental needs.”

Would you like to try revising the paragraph yourself now, or would you prefer I provide a fully revised draft? Also, do you want help with just content and logical flow (C), or content plus sentence-level grammar and vocabulary improvements (C + D)?

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The original draft takes a clear position and raises relevant ideas (tension between protecting migrant workers and protecting native workers), but arguments are underdeveloped and sometimes contradictory (e.g., “governments should not enforce stricter laws… without considering the balance” versus later urging protection). Claims lack concrete evidence and deeper explanation.
- Organization: 17/25 - The essay has an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion, but paragraph focus and logical progression are uneven. Transitions are weak and some paragraphs repeat ideas rather than developing them in a clear problem → consequence → solution sequence.
- Vocabulary: 17/25 - Vocabulary is adequate to express main ideas, with some topic‑specific terms (wages, labor market). Word choice is occasionally imprecise or informal (e.g., “lowest line of hourly wages,” “minority of the society”).
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 15/25 - Frequent grammar, punctuation, and sentence‑structure issues (run‑ons, missing punctuation, article errors) that occasionally obscure meaning.

- **Original Essay Total: 67/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised essay clarifies the author’s position (support stricter laws but with balance) and incorporates more concrete policy language (minimum wages, basic labour rights). This is a meaningful improvement in clarity and purpose. However, reasoning and evidence remain general and some claims (especially about effects on native workers) need clearer support.
- Organization: 20/25 - The thesis now previews policy emphasis and balance, and the paragraph on migrant protections contains a stronger topic sentence. Paragraph 2 (native workers) shows improvement attempts but still has logical gaps and some ungrammatical sentences, so coherence across the essay is improved but not fully consistent.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Revision shows better precision (e.g., “minimum hourly wage,” “limits on daily working hours” were suggested / used). Some informal phrasing and inconsistent spelling choices (labour vs. labor) remain but overall vocabulary is more appropriate for academic writing.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 18/25 - Noticeable corrections (topic sentence reworking, clearer thesis). Many sentence‑level errors remain (punctuation, clause structure), especially in the paragraph about harms to native workers where several iterations still left an ungrammatical sentence. Overall accuracy improved to a satisfactory level but not yet consistently high.

- **Revised Essay Total: 79/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +12 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis clarified and made more assertive: the student revised from a hedged “In my opinion…” to a clear position: “Governments should enforce stricter laws … while also maintaining a fair balance…”
  - Topic sentence for the paragraph about protecting migrant workers was revised to be assertive and preview reasons: “First of all, governments must ensure the basic labour rights of migrant workers, because weak regulations leave them vulnerable to exploitation, excessive working hours, and unfairly low wages.”
  - Policy language became more concrete: the student (with assistant prompts) incorporated ideas like minimum hourly wages and limits on working hours rather than vague phrases like “lowest line” or “rule the working time.”
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Paragraph 2 (about harms to native workers) remains underdeveloped and contains ungrammatical topic-sentence attempts. The student worked on it but did not deliver a fully revised, grammatical paragraph that explains mechanisms and evidence.
  - Evidence and examples: both versions make claims (e.g., that protecting migrants will significantly increase native unemployment) without supporting data, examples, or clearer causal explanation.
  - Sentence-level accuracy: persistent punctuation and clause-structure errors remain in several sentences across the revised essay. A careful proofreading pass is still needed.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 35** (approximately 35 back-and-forth messages in the provided chat history, including multiple iterative revisions of thesis and topic sentences)
- **Conversation Quality:** The chat shows an extended, purposeful, iterative tutoring exchange. The assistant provided structured steps (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph revision) and model sentences, and the student repeatedly revised the thesis and topic sentences. The student requested both comments and full paragraph revisions and made several concrete changes based on AI guidance.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - Evidence: The chat contains many exchanges across multiple steps (thesis multiple rewrites, topic-sentence work for both paragraphs, paragraph-level discussion). The student engaged in iterative back-and-forth, asked for examples (“show example”), and responded with revisions. This meets the “extensive exchanges” descriptor.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - Evidence: The student generally accepted the assistant’s guidance but also made choices (e.g., selecting which model thesis to adapt) and asked for revisions rather than blindly copying suggestions. There was some evaluation (the student asked for examples, requested comments, and iterated on wording). A slightly higher score would require more explicit justification from the student about why they accepted or rejected particular suggestions.
  - Example: After receiving suggested thesis templates, the student adapted and repeatedly refined their thesis rather than accepting a single model outright.
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - Evidence: Multiple meaningful revision cycles are visible: the student rewrote the thesis several times, iterated on topic sentences for both paragraphs (particularly paragraph 1), and asked to revise a body paragraph (paragraph 2). The assistant guided stepwise (A → B → C), and the student followed an iterative revision path showing active refinement.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear engagement with the revision process: the student followed a structured workflow, repeatedly revised the thesis, and worked on topic-sentence clarity (evidence: multiple thesis drafts and topic-sentence revisions in the chat).
- Adoption of more precise policy language: the student moved from vague phrasing (“etc.,” “lowest line”) to policy terms like “minimum wages” and “limits on working hours.”
- Effective use of AI prompts and models: the student requested examples and model sentences and integrated those into their drafts.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Complete the requested paragraph revision: the student asked to revise paragraph 2 but did not produce a final revised version. Deliver a fully rewritten paragraph that is grammatical, logically coherent, and tied to the thesis.
- Strengthen causal explanation and evidence: explain clearly how proposed protections would lead to the claimed effects on native employment (use brief reasoning, a hypothetical example, or a cited fact if available).
- Proofreading and sentence-level accuracy: address remaining punctuation, clause-structure, and article errors (especially run-ons and missing punctuation).
- Move from descriptive to analytic: avoid repeated assertions; instead show cause → effect → policy outcome for each claim.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the essay text and clear revision goals (selected A then B etc.), enabling targeted assistance (evidence: the student confirmed targets and pasted drafts).
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student followed the assistant’s three-step plan and prioritized thesis/topic-sentence work before paragraph revision.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good/Developing - The student sometimes questioned and iterated rather than blindly accepting suggestions, but more explicit justification about choices would strengthen critical evaluation.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The student produced multiple revised drafts independently (thesis and topic sentences) showing growing independent editing ability.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise and submit a complete, grammatical rewrite of paragraph 2 (the paragraph about potential harms to native workers). Make the topic sentence a single, assertive claim, explain mechanisms (why increased protections might attract more migrants or affect hiring), and add a sentence about safeguards that could mitigate harms.
2. Add one short example or a concise hypothetical (2–3 sentences) showing how a policy (e.g., a minimum wage plus hiring incentives for locals) would affect both migrant and native workers — this will make causal claims more persuasive.
3. Do a final proofreading pass focusing on punctuation and clause structure (break up run‑ons, ensure commas follow introductory clauses, and choose one spelling convention: labour vs. labor). Reading sentences aloud or using a grammar checker can help catch remaining issues.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student clearly understands the revision workflow and engaged actively with the AI tutor, improving thesis clarity and paragraph focus. However, the student did not complete the full body-paragraph revision they requested (paragraph 2 remained unfinished/ungrammatical). The instructor may want to ask the student to submit the final revised paragraph (and run a brief proofreading check) to complete the assignment requirements.
- Evidence of learning: the student incorporated model language and constructive feedback, which shows progress toward course learning objectives in argumentative clarity and use of policy vocabulary.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
 Gone are the days when there were only native workers in a country. Nowadays, due to the fast developed technology, the transportation network between different countries become more and more mature. Therefore, migrant workers occur, which is an unstoppable trend. However, migrant workers are facing different serious problems. In my opinion, the governments should not enforce stricter laws to safeguard the rights of migrant workers
without considering the balance between native and migrant workers.

        First of all, governments should ensure the basic rights of migrant workers They are facing exploitation due to the weak regulations, having unreasonably long working hours, and receiving unfairly low wages. This is a common phenomenon in the world since migrant workers are not protected by the local law. Also, some of them migrate illegally, causing the serious problems. Therefore, the government should set up laws to protect the minority of the society. For example, governments may set up the lowest line of hourly wages for migrant workers, or rule the working time per day for them. These are their basic needs, and should be satisfied.

      While the migrant workers were getting protected, here came a problem, what about the native workers? If the rights of migrant workers are over protected, then that of the native workers will be harmed. When the governments not only satisfying the basic needs of migrant workers, an increasing number of workers overseas will be attracted. Moreover, the migrant workers are going to keep staying at the countries, not going back to their hometown. Then the competition of the labour market increased. The rights of the native workers are transported to migrant workers. Because of the lower requirement of migrant workers. they are employed more easily. Lastly, the employment rate of native workers will be increased significantly, and this should not happen in any country.

        All in all, the governments should protect the rights of migrant workers, but not damaging the native workers. Before considering the migrant workers, governments should consider the rights of native first. 


Revised:
 Gone are the days when there were only native workers in a country. Nowadays, due to the fast developed technology, the transportation network between different countries become more and more mature. Therefore, migrant workers occur, which is an unstoppable trend. However, migrant workers are facing different serious problems. Governments should enforce stricter laws (such as protecting basic labour rights, setting minimum wages) to safeguard the rights of migrant workers while also maintaining a fair balance between native and migrant workers.

        Firstly, governments must ensure the basic labour rights of migrant workers, because weak regulations leave them vulnerable to exploitation, excessive working hours, and unfairly low wages. This is a common phenomenon in the world since migrant workers are not protected by the local law. Also, some of them migrate illegally, causing the serious problems. Therefore, the government should set up laws to protect the minority of the society. For example, governments may set up the minimum hourly wage for migrant workers, or limits on daily working hours for them. These are their basic needs, and should be satisfied.

      However, stricter migrant protection may threaten the rights of native workers by increasing labor-market competition and reducing local hiring.When the governments not only satisfying the basic needs of migrant workers, an increasing number of workers overseas will be attracted. Moreover, the migrant workers are going to keep staying at the countries, not going back to their hometown. Then the competition of the labour market increased. The rights of the native workers are transported to migrant workers. Because of the lower requirement of migrant workers. they are employed more easily. Lastly, the employment rate of native workers will be increased significantly, and this should not happen in any country.

        All in all, the governments should protect the rights of migrant workers, but not damaging the native workers. Before considering the migrant workers, governments should consider the rights of native first.

**You:** Gone are the days when there were only native workers in a country. Nowadays, due to the fast developed technology, the transportation network between different countries become more and more mature. Therefore, migrant workers occur, which is an unstoppable trend. However, migrant workers are facing different serious problems. In my opinion, the governments should not enforce stricter laws to safeguard the rights of migrant workers
without considering the balance between native and migrant workers.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:03:23.153Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s start by setting clear goals so our session is focused and useful for you.

1) Your goals
- What do you most want to improve in this essay today? (For example: make your argument clearer, strengthen the thesis, improve paragraph structure and topic sentences, add or analyze evidence, fix grammar and word choice, or improve flow and style.)
- Which of those are highest priority for you right now? (Pick 1–3.)

2) Quick diagnostic read (brief, clear feedback using rubric categories)
I read your draft. Below is a short diagnosis so you can decide what to work on.

- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: You do take a position and you attempt to consider both migrant and native workers.
  - Areas to improve: The thesis is unclear and a little contradictory. You say governments “should not enforce stricter laws… without considering the balance,” but later you also say governments should protect migrant rights. The thesis doesn’t clearly preview the main reasons you will discuss.

- Organization
  - Strengths: The essay has an introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion.
  - Areas to improve: Paragraph focus is uneven. Transitions and logical links between ideas (for example, how protection leads to harm for natives) need clearer explanation and stronger topic sentences.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: You include some examples and concrete possible policies (minimum wage, work hours).
  - Areas to improve: Evidence is general and lacks specifics or clear reasoning. Some claims (e.g., “employment rate of native workers will be increased significantly”) are unclear or seem unsupported.

- Language Use (grammar, word choice, clarity)
  - Strengths: Meaning is mostly understandable.
  - Areas to improve: Frequent grammar and punctuation errors (verb tense, articles, sentence fragments). Word choice and sentence structure sometimes obscure your meaning. Formal writing would avoid phrases like “In my opinion.”

3) Choose priorities
From the diagnosed issues above, which would you like to focus on in this session? (Pick up to three—examples below)
- A: Make the thesis clear, confident, and preview your reasons
- B: Strengthen one body paragraph’s topic sentence so it connects clearly to the thesis
- C: Revise that whole paragraph for clearer support and logic
- D: Fix language problems in that paragraph (grammar, punctuation, word choice)

Please tell me which of these you want to work on (for example: A + B + C, or just A and B). Once you confirm, we’ll start Step 1.

Step 1 — Thesis statement revision (when you confirm)
- Please paste your current thesis here (or confirm that this is the thesis you want to revise):
  "In my opinion, the governments should not enforce stricter laws to safeguard the rights of migrant workers without considering the balance between native and migrant workers."
- Would you like to try rewriting it now? Try to:
  - State your position directly (avoid “In my opinion”).
  - Answer the question clearly (Yes/No to stricter laws, or Yes but with conditions).
  - Preview 2–3 main reasons you will explain in the essay.
- If you want, try one sentence and I’ll give feedback. If you prefer an example to start from, say “Show example” and I’ll provide a model thesis you can adapt.

Tell me your chosen priorities and paste or confirm the thesis to revise — then we’ll continue.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:03:40.492Z

**You:** A

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:14:18.152Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. I see you chose A: make the thesis clear, confident, and preview your reasons. Confirming that is our only target for this session before we start Step 1. Ready?

Here is your current thesis:
"In my opinion, the governments should not enforce stricter laws to safeguard the rights of migrant workers without considering the balance between native and migrant workers."

Quick tips for a stronger thesis (short and focused)
- Drop “In my opinion.” State your position directly and confidently.
- Answer the question clearly: Do you support stricter laws (yes), oppose them (no), or support them with conditions (yes, but…)?
- Preview 2–3 clear reasons you will discuss (e.g., protecting basic rights, ensuring fair labor-market balance, and including safeguards to avoid harm to native workers).

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Try one sentence. If you want a model to adapt instead, say “Show example” and I’ll give a model thesis you can edit.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:14:28.604Z

**You:** In my opinion, the governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard the rights of migrant workers while also maintaining a fair balance between native and migrant workers.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:15:31.476Z

**Assistant:** Nice revision — you’ve already clarified that you support stricter laws but want balance. Good start.

Quick feedback on this draft thesis:
"In my opinion, the governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard the rights of migrant workers while also maintaining a fair balance between native and migrant workers."

- Drop “In my opinion.” State it directly: e.g., “Governments should…”
- Use “governments” (no “the”) or “the government” — don’t write “the governments.”
- Be more specific about the reasons you will discuss. Right now “maintaining a fair balance” is vague. Preview 2–3 concrete points (for example: protecting basic labor rights, setting minimum wages/limits on hours, and including safeguards to protect native workers’ employment).
- Use precise, confident language (avoid passive hedging).

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now, using one sentence that:
- States your position directly,
- Answers the question clearly (Yes, but with conditions),
- Previews 2–3 clear reasons you will discuss?

Try one sentence, and I’ll give feedback. If you prefer a model to adapt, say “Show example.”

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:15:45.346Z

**You:** show example

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:17:15.772Z

**Assistant:** Great — here are three model, one-sentence thesis options you can adapt. Each states a clear position and previews reasons you can develop in the essay. Read them, pick one to edit or combine, or try your own version now.

Model A (conditional support, concrete reasons)
Governments should enforce stricter labor laws to protect migrant workers’ basic rights (fair wages and reasonable hours) while adding safeguards — such as targeted job programs and monitored enforcement — to prevent harm to native workers.

Model B (balanced, policy-focused)
Governments should introduce stronger legal protections for migrant workers — including minimum wages and enforceable limits on working hours — and simultaneously implement measures (training, hiring incentives, and enforcement oversight) to maintain a fair labor-market balance for native workers.

Model C (shorter, emphasis on pairing laws with safeguards)
Stricter laws are necessary to stop migrant-worker exploitation, but governments must pair these protections with policies that protect native employment and manage migration flows to preserve labor-market fairness.

Quick tips as you adapt:
- Drop “In my opinion.” Use “Governments should…” or “Governments must…”
- Preview 2–3 reasons you will discuss (e.g., protect basic rights, set wages/hours, add safeguards for natives).
- Keep it one clear sentence.

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now? Paste your version and I’ll give targeted feedback.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:17:25.954Z

**You:** Governments should enforce stricter laws, such as protecting basic labour rights, setting minimum wages, etc., to safeguard the rights of migrant workers while also maintaining a fair balance between native and migrant workers.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:19:57.415Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this is a clear improvement. Before we move on, let’s confirm: you chose A (make the thesis clear, confident, and preview your reasons) as our only target for this step. Is that correct? If yes, we’ll focus only on improving the thesis now.

Quick feedback on your current thesis:
"Governments should enforce stricter laws, such as protecting basic labour rights, setting minimum wages, etc., to safeguard the rights of migrant workers while also maintaining a fair balance between native and migrant workers."

What’s good
- Your position is clear: you support stricter laws.
- You mention concrete policy ideas (basic rights, minimum wages).

What to improve (short, actionable)
- Drop "etc." — it’s vague in academic writing. List 1–3 concrete items instead.
- Make the reasons you’ll discuss explicit (preview 2–3 points, e.g., minimum wages, limits on hours, and safeguards for native employment).
- Avoid wordiness: “to safeguard the rights of migrant workers while also maintaining a fair balance between native and migrant workers” can be tightened.
- Decide on British vs. American spelling (labour vs. labor) and be consistent; either is fine.
- Use confident phrasing and avoid extra commas that break flow.

Would you like to try another one-sentence revision now? Try to:
- Begin with “Governments should…” or “Governments must…”
- Give 2–3 specific reasons you will develop (e.g., protect wages/hours; enforce penalties; create safeguards for native workers)
- Keep it one clear sentence and drop “etc.”

If you’d like a quick model to adapt, pick one of these and edit it to match your voice:

Model 1 (policy + safeguards)
Governments should enforce stricter labor laws—such as minimum wages and limits on working hours—to protect migrant workers’ basic rights while also implementing safeguards to protect native employment.

Model 2 (shorter, balanced)
Governments should introduce stronger protections for migrant workers (minimum wages and enforceable hour limits) while pairing these laws with measures to prevent harm to native workers’ job prospects.

Try adapting one of these or write your own revision now, and I’ll give focused feedback.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:20:11.082Z

**You:** Governments should enforce stricter laws (such as protecting basic labour rights, setting minimum wages) to safeguard the rights of migrant workers while also maintaining a fair balance between native and migrant workers.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:22:03.506Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this is a clear, confident draft of your thesis and you’ve done the important work of stating a position and naming policies. Quick confirmation: we’re still focusing on target A only (make the thesis clear, confident, and preview your reasons). Is that right? If yes, I’ll keep feedback focused on the thesis.

Brief feedback on your thesis
"Governments should enforce stricter laws (such as protecting basic labour rights, setting minimum wages) to safeguard the rights of migrant workers while also maintaining a fair balance between native and migrant workers."

What’s strong
- Your position is clear: you support stricter laws.
- You mention concrete policies (minimum wages, basic rights).

What to improve (short, actionable)
- Drop the parentheses; integrate the examples smoothly into the sentence.
- Replace vague phrasing like “maintaining a fair balance” with a specific preview of how you’ll protect natives (e.g., safeguards for native employment, training or hiring incentives, enforcement that prevents abuse).
- Remove redundancy (“migrant workers” repeated) and tighten wording so the sentence flows.
- Pick one spelling standard (labour vs. labor) and be consistent.

Next step — try another revision
Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Aim for one sentence that:
- Begins with “Governments should…” or “Governments must…”
- Names 2–3 concrete reasons you will discuss (for example: protect wages/hours; enforce penalties; include safeguards to protect native employment)
- Is concise and avoids parentheses or “etc.”

If it helps, you can borrow one of these short phrases to insert (don’t copy the whole sentence unless you want a model):
- “while pairing these laws with safeguards to protect native employment”
- “including enforceable minimum wages and limits on working hours”
- “and introduce measures (training, hiring incentives) to prevent harm to native workers”

Go ahead — try one sentence and paste it here. I’ll give focused feedback and we’ll polish it until you’re satisfied.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:22:22.900Z

**You:** First of all, governments should ensure the basic rights of migrant workers They are facing exploitation due to the weak regulations, having unreasonably long working hours, and receiving unfairly low wages. This is a common phenomenon in the world since migrant workers are not protected by the local law. Also, some of them migrate illegally, causing the serious problems. Therefore, the government should set up laws to protect the minority of the society. For example, governments may set up the lowest line of hourly wages for migrant workers, or rule the working time per day for them. These are their basic needs, and should be satisfied.

      While the migrant workers were getting protected, here came a problem, what about the native workers? If the rights of migrant workers are over protected, then that of the native workers will be harmed. When the governments not only satisfying the basic needs of migrant workers, an increasing number of workers overseas will be attracted. Moreover, the migrant workers are going to keep staying at the countries, not going back to their hometown. Then the competition of the labour market increased. The rights of the native workers are transported to migrant workers. Because of the lower requirement of migrant workers. they are employed more easily. Lastly, the employment rate of native workers will be increased significantly, and this should not happen in any country.
check topic sentence

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:23:14.721Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is helpful. Before I check the topic sentence, quick checkpoints so we stay focused:

- What exactly do you want me to help with now? (Pick one)
  - B: Strengthen a body paragraph’s topic sentence so it connects to your thesis
  - C: Then revise that paragraph’s support for clarity and logic
  - D: Fix language (grammar/punctuation) in that paragraph

If you only want B right now, say “B.” If you want more, say “B + C” or “B + D.”

Which paragraph should we work on? You pasted two body paragraphs. Which topic sentence do you want checked?
- Paragraph 1 (about protecting migrant workers)
- Paragraph 2 (about harms to native workers)

I’ll assume you want B only and to work on Paragraph 2 (it’s the weaker sentence), unless you tell me otherwise.

Quick diagnosis of the current topic sentence in Paragraph 2:
"While the migrant workers were getting protected, here came a problem, what about the native workers?"

What’s working
- You try to signal a contrast with the previous paragraph (good — use of contrast is appropriate).
- You raise the key concern (native workers) that links to your thesis.

What to improve (specific, actionable)
- Grammar and punctuation: it’s a run-on and awkwardly phrased. Use a clear connector (However, Nevertheless, But) instead of the long “While… here came a problem” phrasing.
- Clarity of claim: a topic sentence should make one clear claim that directly connects to your thesis (that stricter laws should be balanced to avoid harming natives). Right now it’s more of a question than an assertive claim.
- Previewing support: the topic sentence should hint at the reason(s) you’ll explain (e.g., increased competition, lower wages, fewer job opportunities for natives).

Try revising first (encouragement)
Would you like to try rewriting that topic sentence now? Try one confident sentence. If you prefer, I can show model sentences you can adapt — tell me which.

If you want examples, here are three model topic-sentence options you can adapt (pick one and edit to match your voice):

Model 1 (direct claim + reason)
However, stricter protections for migrant workers can harm native workers by increasing labor market competition and putting downward pressure on wages.

Model 2 (links to thesis and previews two supports)
While governments must protect migrant rights, overly strict policies can disadvantage native workers by attracting more migrants and reducing job opportunities for locals.

Model 3 (policy-focused, paired with safeguards)
Although stronger laws are needed to stop exploitation, they must include safeguards — such as hiring incentives for natives — to prevent unintended harm to local employment.

Next step
Which do you want to do now?
- Try your own revision and paste it here (I’ll give focused feedback), or
- Ask me to pick one of the models and adapt it for your paragraph?

I’ll wait for your choice — you’re doing well to focus on making the paragraph connect clearly to your thesis.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:23:34.047Z

**You:** B, both Paragraph 1 (about protecting migrant workers) and 

Paragraph 2 (about harms to native workers)

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:30:04.054Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for your choice. I’ll confirm our plan before we start:

- Agreed target(s): B — strengthen topic sentences for both Paragraph 1 (protecting migrant workers) and Paragraph 2 (harms to native workers). We will still follow the three-step workflow, which means we begin with Step 1 (thesis revision), then move to Step 2 (topic sentences) and Step 3 (revise one paragraph’s content). Is that still okay?

Step 1 — Thesis revision (brief)
Please confirm which thesis you want to revise. I see this version in your current draft — is this the one?
"Governments should enforce stricter laws (such as protecting basic labour rights, setting minimum wages) to safeguard the rights of migrant workers while also maintaining a fair balance between native and migrant workers."

Quick feedback (short and focused)
- Strengths: Position is clear (you support stricter laws) and you give some concrete examples (minimum wages).
- Fixes needed: Drop parentheses and “etc.”; tighten wording; preview 2–3 concrete reasons you will develop (for example, protect wages/hours, ensure enforcement, and include safeguards to protect native employment). Choose one spelling standard (labour vs. labor).

Your turn (encouragement)
Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Aim for one confident sentence that:
- Begins with “Governments should…” (or “Governments must…”),
- States your position clearly (Yes, but with conditions),
- Previews 2–3 concrete reasons you will discuss (e.g., minimum wages, enforceable hour limits, and safeguards for native employment).

Try one sentence and paste it here. If you prefer an example to adapt, say “Show example” and I’ll give 2–3 model theses you can edit.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:30:17.735Z

**You:** move to paragraph 2

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:34:36.836Z

**Assistant:** Great — we’ll focus on Paragraph 2 (the weaker one) now.

Quick confirm: Paragraph 2 is the one that begins with this topic sentence:
"While the migrant workers were getting protected, here came a problem, what about the native workers?"

Short feedback (focus on connection to your thesis)
- Make it an assertive claim (not a question). Topic sentences should state one clear idea that links back to your thesis (that stricter laws need balancing).
- Use a clear contrast word (However, Yet, While) and preview the reasons you’ll explain (for example: increased competition, lower hiring for natives, downward pressure on wages).
- Fix grammar and punctuation and avoid wordy/unnecessary phrases (“here came a problem” is informal and weak).

Would you like to try rewriting that one sentence now? Try to:
- Begin with a contrast word (e.g., However, While, Although).
- Make one clear claim that connects to the thesis (stricter protections can unintentionally harm native workers).
- Preview 1–2 specific reasons you will explain in the paragraph.

Give it a go — paste your revised topic sentence and I’ll give focused feedback. If you’d prefer examples first, say “Show example” and I’ll provide 2–3 model topic sentences you can adapt.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:34:52.865Z

**You:** However, when migrant workers are strongly protected, the rights of native workers maybe put at risk.If the rights of migrant workers are over protected, then that of the native workers will be harmed.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:40:37.453Z

**Assistant:** Nice try — good that you attempted a revision. A few quick, focused notes, then a chance for you to try again.

What needs fixing in your sentence
- Grammar/punctuation: write “may be” as two words only when used in this sense (“may be put at risk”), and add a space after the period.  
- Clarity: it reads as a warning/question rather than a clear claim. Topic sentences should state one clear idea.  
- Connection to thesis: show how this links to your thesis (that stricter laws need balancing) and preview at least one reason you will explain (e.g., increased competition, fewer jobs for natives).

Try again now
Would you like to rewrite it once more? Aim for one confident sentence that:
- Begins with a contrast word (However, While, Although),
- Makes a clear claim that links to your thesis (stricter protections can unintentionally harm native workers),
- Previews 1–2 reasons you will explain in the paragraph.

If you’d like a quick model to adapt, here are three short options you can edit to match your voice:
1) However, overly strict protections for migrant workers can threaten native workers’ job prospects by increasing labor-market competition and reducing local hiring.  
2) While protecting migrant rights is necessary, excessive protections may disadvantage native workers through greater competition for low-skilled jobs.  
3) Although stronger laws are needed to stop exploitation, they must include safeguards — such as hiring incentives for locals — to prevent harm to native employment.

Pick one to adapt or paste your new attempt and I’ll give focused feedback.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:40:56.949Z

**You:** However, when stricter migrant protection may threaten the rights of native workers by increasing labor-market competition and reducing local hiring.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:45:01.015Z

**Assistant:** Good attempt — nice to see you working on a clearer, more connected topic sentence.

Quick, focused feedback
- Main problem: the sentence is ungrammatical because it combines "However" with "when" and ends up as a dependent clause. Topic sentences should be one independent, assertive sentence.
- Make it a clear claim that links to your thesis (stricter protections need balancing) and preview 1–2 reasons you will explain (e.g., more competition, fewer local hires).
- Keep it direct and confident (avoid question-like phrasing).

Would you like to try revising it again now? Try making one confident sentence that begins with a contrast word (However / While / Although) and states clearly that stricter protections can unintentionally harm native workers, with 1–2 reasons.

If you’d like help, say “Show examples.” I’ll then give 2–3 short model topic sentences you can adapt. Which would you like to do?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:45:13.191Z

**You:** First of all, governments should ensure the basic rights of migrant workers They are facing exploitation due to the weak regulations, having unreasonably long working hours, and receiving unfairly low wages. This is a common phenomenon in the world since migrant workers are not protected by the local law. Also, some of them migrate illegally, causing the serious problems. Therefore, the government should set up laws to protect the minority of the society. For example, governments may set up the lowest line of hourly wages for migrant workers, or rule the working time per day for them. These are their basic needs, and should be satisfied. revise topic sentence of this para

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:47:26.007Z

**Assistant:** Nice — thanks for that paragraph. Quick check before I revise: do you want me to just suggest a stronger topic sentence (so you can practice integrating it), or would you like me to give a few ready-to-adapt options? (Pick one.)

If you want to try first, paste your attempt and I’ll give focused feedback. If you want examples, below are three model topic sentences you can adapt. Each is assertive, links to your thesis (stricter laws needed), and previews the paragraph’s support (exploitation, long hours, low pay, and policy fixes).

Model 1 (direct + reasons)
First, governments must ensure migrant workers’ basic rights, because weak regulations leave them vulnerable to exploitation, excessive working hours, and unfairly low wages.

Model 2 (policy-focused)
To protect migrant workers from exploitation, governments should implement and enforce minimum labor standards—such as enforceable minimum wages and limits on daily working hours.

Model 3 (link to thesis + explanation)
Ensuring enforceable protections for migrant workers—like minimum pay and hour limits—is essential, since without these safeguards migrants often face long hours, low pay, and legal insecurity.

Why these work (short)
- They are assertive (not a question).
- They connect clearly to your thesis (support for stricter laws).
- They preview the paragraph’s main points so the paragraph will feel focused.

Which would you like to use or adapt? Or would you like to try your own revision first?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:47:42.252Z

**You:** give comment

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:48:25.535Z

**Assistant:** Good — thanks for asking. Here’s a short, focused comment on each of the three model topic sentences you were looking at, and a clear next step.

Model 1 (First, governments must ensure migrant workers’ basic rights, because weak regulations leave them vulnerable to exploitation, excessive working hours, and unfairly low wages.)
- What’s strong: Assertive and clearly linked to the paragraph’s examples (exploitation, long hours, low pay). Works well for a paragraph that explains the problem.
- What to watch: The “because” clause is long; consider smoothing the flow so the main claim stays prominent.
- Use it if: This paragraph’s main goal is to explain why protections are needed.

Model 2 (To protect migrant workers from exploitation, governments should implement and enforce minimum labor standards—such as enforceable minimum wages and limits on daily working hours.)
- What’s strong: Policy-focused and readable; good if the paragraph emphasizes concrete policy remedies.
- What to watch: It states the solution more than the problem; if you want a connection to your thesis, you may need a quick link back to balancing native workers later in the paragraph.
- Use it if: You plan to discuss specific laws and how they would work.

Model 3 (Ensuring enforceable protections for migrant workers—like minimum pay and hour limits—is essential, since without these safeguards migrants often face long hours, low pay, and legal insecurity.)
- What’s strong: Balanced: it states necessity and immediately explains consequences. It also reads naturally and ties cause to effect.
- What to watch: It’s slightly more formal; make sure the paragraph follows with concrete examples or explanation so the claim is developed.
- Use it if: You want a sentence that both asserts and previews the paragraph’s support.

Quick suggestion for choosing
- If the paragraph’s purpose is to describe the problem and its harms: pick Model 1 or 3.
- If the paragraph’s purpose is to describe possible laws and how they help: pick Model 2.

Next step
- Which model do you want to use or adapt for this paragraph? Or would you like to try writing your own topic sentence now? Paste your sentence if you want targeted feedback—I’ll give one or two short, specific edits and then we’ll revise the paragraph content together.

 topic sentence of this para

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:49:44.473Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I’ll focus just on the topic sentence, as you asked. Short, clear feedback first, then a quick next step you can try.

What’s working
- The sentence signals the paragraph’s main focus: protecting migrant workers. That connects to your essay’s overall argument, which is good.
- Starting with a transition (“First of all”) signals structure to the reader.

What needs improvement (specific, actionable)
1. Grammar and punctuation
   - There’s a missing period (or connector) after “migrant workers.” Right now the first two sentences run together.
2. Make the sentence assertive and complete
   - Topic sentences should state a clear claim, not just announce a topic. “Governments should ensure the basic rights of migrant workers” is a start, but it can be stronger and more specific.
3. Link it to the paragraph’s reasons (preview)
   - A good topic sentence previews why the claim matters (e.g., because weak regulations leave migrants vulnerable to exploitation, long hours, and low pay). That helps the paragraph feel unified and clearly connected to your thesis.

How to revise it (step-by-step, small edits)
- Fix the punctuation: either end the sentence after “migrant workers.” and start the next sentence with “They…” OR connect them with a linking word: change “They are facing” to “because they face…” or “as they face…”
- Strengthen the verb: consider a firmer verb (e.g., “must” or “need to”) if you want a more confident academic tone.
- Add a brief preview clause: attach one short reason (or a list of the problems you will explain) so readers know what this paragraph will cover.

Try this next (your turn)
- Could you try rewriting the topic sentence now, using the three steps above? Keep it to one sentence that: (a) is grammatically complete, (b) makes a clear claim, and (c) previews 1–2 reasons you’ll develop in the paragraph. Paste your attempt and I’ll give focused feedback.

**You:** First of all, governments must ensure the basic rights of migrant workers, because weak regulations leave them vulnerable to exploitation, unreasonably long working hours, and unfairly low wages.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:52:44.347Z

**Assistant:** Nice revision — this is much clearer and more assertive than the original. Good job!

Quick, focused feedback (short bullets)
- Tone/wording: “First of all” is conversational. Try “First,” “Firstly,” or drop it for a stronger academic tone.
- Precision: “basic rights” is okay, but “basic labor/employment rights” is more specific and ties directly to your examples.
- Word choice: prefer “excessive working hours” or “long working hours” to “unreasonably long working hours” for formality and flow.
- Flow: the sentence is grammatically fine, but you can tighten it by removing the comma before because (optional) or by using “since” for a slightly smoother link.
- Link to thesis: it already connects to your thesis (support for stricter laws). If you want stronger unity, consider briefly naming a policy (e.g., “such as minimum wages and hour limits”) — but you don’t have to.

Suggested small edits you can try (don’t worry — you write the next version)
- Change “First of all” → “First,” or drop it.
- Replace “basic rights” → “basic labor rights” (or “basic employment rights”).
- Replace “unreasonably long working hours” → “excessive working hours.”

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now using those tweaks? Paste your version and I’ll give quick targeted feedback.

When you’re happy with this topic sentence, tell me if you want to move to Step 3: revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity, unity, and evidence (I can help with logic and sentence-level fixes). Do you want B + C, or do you want B + C + D (also fix grammar/punctuation)?

**Assistant:** Do you mean the first paragraph (about protecting migrant workers) or the second paragraph (about harms to native workers)? Also, do you want me to revise just the paragraph’s content and logic (C) or include sentence-level grammar and word-choice fixes too (C + D)?

Tell me: Paragraph 1 or Paragraph 2, and C or C + D. Once you confirm, I’ll revise that paragraph and return the full essay with the updated paragraph.

**You:** paragraph 2

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:56:07.442Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — one quick clarification before we begin: do you want me to revise paragraph 2’s content only (C), or revise content plus fix sentence-level grammar and word choice as well (C + D)? Also, do you want us to work on the paragraph’s topic sentence first (B) before the full paragraph? (Pick one: B + C, B + C + D, or just C/C + D if you prefer.)

Step 1 (required): we need to check the thesis first. Please confirm which thesis you want to use for this session — is it this version from your draft?

"Governments should enforce stricter laws (such as protecting basic labour rights, setting minimum wages) to safeguard the rights of migrant workers while also maintaining a fair balance between native and migrant workers."

If that is the thesis you want to revise, would you like to try rewriting it now as one clear sentence that:
- begins with “Governments should…” or “Governments must…”,
- states your position (yes, but with conditions),
- previews 2–3 concrete reasons you will discuss (for example: minimum wages and hour limits; enforceable protections; safeguards to protect native employment)?

Try one sentence and paste it here. I’ll give quick focused feedback, then we’ll move to the topic sentence for paragraph 2.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:56:26.344Z

**You:** "Firstly, governments must ensure the basic labour rights of migrant workers, because weak regulations leave them vulnerable to exploitation, excessive working hours, and unfairly low wages.

These are their basic needs, and should be satisfied." give some comment on this body paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-29T08:58:10.065Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a useful paragraph with good intentions and some concrete ideas. I’ll give short, focused feedback so you can revise it confidently.

What’s working
- Clear purpose: the paragraph argues that governments should protect migrant workers and lists specific harms (exploitation, long hours, low wages).
- Some policy ideas: you suggest minimum wages and limits on working time, which are concrete and useful.

What to improve (actionable, prioritized)
1. Topic sentence and focus
   - Make the main claim sharper and more specific (e.g., “Governments must ensure migrant workers’ basic labor rights”). Right now the paragraph opens awkwardly and the claim is split across sentences.
2. Unity and logical development
   - Some sentences repeat the same idea (weak regulation → vulnerability). Combine or reorder to avoid redundancy and create a clear problem → consequence → solution sequence.
   - The sentence about illegal migration (“Also, some of them migrate illegally, causing the serious problems.”) is vague: what problems? Explain briefly why illegal status makes them more vulnerable and how laws could help.
3. Evidence and explanation
   - The examples of minimum wage and working-hour limits are good but thin. Add a short explanation of how these policies would reduce exploitation (even one more sentence), or mention a brief example or hypothetical (no need for exact statistics if you don’t have them).
4. Language, grammar, and word choice
   - Fix awkward phrases and articles: “the basic labour rights” → “basic labour rights” or “basic labor rights” (pick one spelling and be consistent); “the lowest line of hourly wages” → “a minimum hourly wage”; “rule the working time per day” → “set limits on daily working hours.”
   - Avoid informal or unclear expressions: “minority of the society” → “a vulnerable minority” or “a vulnerable group” (or better: “migrant workers, who are often vulnerable”).
   - Combine short, choppy sentences into smoother ones for academic tone.

Quick revision plan (small steps you can try)
- Step 1 (tighten topic sentence): Make one clear, assertive sentence saying governments must protect migrant workers’ basic labor rights.
- Step 2 (organize support): Follow with 1–2 sentences that explain the main problems (exploitation, long hours, low pay) and why weak regulation causes them.
- Step 3 (policy solution + link): End with one sentence that names the policy actions (minimum wage, limits on hours) and briefly says how these will help.

Suggested short phrase swaps (use these in your revision)
- “minimum hourly wage” (instead of “lowest line of hourly wages”)
- “limits on daily working hours” (instead of “rule the working time per day”)
- “vulnerable to exploitation” (instead of “facing exploitation”)

Guiding questions to check your revision
- Does each sentence clearly relate to the topic sentence?
- Do you explain how each policy solves a named problem?
- Have you removed repeated ideas and smoothed grammar?

Would you like to try revising this paragraph now? If yes, tell me whether you want:
- B: help rewriting the topic sentence only, or
- C: help reorganizing the whole paragraph’s content, or
- C + D: reorganizing plus sentence-level grammar and word-choice edits.

Paste your revision when you’re ready and I’ll give focused feedback.
