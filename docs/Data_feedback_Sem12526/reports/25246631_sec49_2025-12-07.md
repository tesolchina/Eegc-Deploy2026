            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for confirming your thesis and choosing the first paragraph to work on!

Here’s a polished version of the topic sentence based on your original idea and the suggestions I gave:

**“First, automation increases companies’ productivity and creates greater demand for skilled IT professionals, expanding job opportunities in local and global markets.”**

Key improvements:  
- Subject-verb agreement: *automation increases*  
- Clearer meaning: productivity and demand for IT professionals  
- Connects directly to thesis: job expansion, global markets  
- Formal tone and grammar fixes

Would you like to:
- Use this version as your revised topic sentence,  
- Try revising it yourself now using the frames I gave, or  
- See one or two more example topic sentences before you decide?

Once you’re happy with the topic sentence, we can move on to revising the rest of that paragraph to improve clarity, vocabulary, and grammar. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The original has a clear overall stance that automation will enhance employment prospects and outlines three supporting ideas (IT/global jobs, data analysis, maintenance). Development is basic and often repetitive; claims lack specific examples or clear explanation.
  - Evidence: "The technologion shift ultimately enhance global empolyment prospects in long term." and paragraph topics listing IT, data analysis, maintenance but with limited development.
- Organization: 18/25 - Basic structure (intro, three body paragraphs, conclusion) is present, but topic sentences are weak and internal paragraph flow is often unclear.
  - Evidence: Paragraphs exist but begin with unclear topic sentences and sometimes jump between ideas.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Attempts to use relevant terms (automation, data analysis) but many misspellings and incorrect word choices reduce clarity.
  - Evidence: "technologion", "empolyment", "requirment", "creativity" spelled inconsistently.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 15/25 - Frequent grammar errors (subject-verb agreement, article use, wrong word forms) and limited sentence variety impede smooth reading.
  - Evidence: "although some of the jobs is reducing", "making the requirment of labour being lower than before."

- **Original Essay Total: 66/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised essay presents a clearer thesis that previews the three main points and generally develops those points more coherently. However, claims still lack concrete examples or data and some sentences are repetitive.
  - Evidence: Revised thesis: "The technological shift ultimately enhances long-term global employment prospects, driving the expansion of skilled IT jobs, increasing demand for data and marketing specialists, and creating more maintenance and semi-skilled roles across industries."
- Organization: 21/25 - Paragraph structure and progression are improved: the thesis previews points and paragraphs correspond to those points. Topic sentences are clearer (e.g., first paragraph begins: "First of all, automation increases the productivity of a company.") Transitions could still be stronger.
  - Evidence: Revised first-topic sentence: "First of all, automation increases the productivity of a company." Paragraphs follow the thesis' three-part preview.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Word choice is more precise overall and key terms are used correctly, but there remain awkward collocations and some non-native phrasing ("by transferring to automation", "help them to analysis") that need polishing.
  - Evidence: Improved terms like "productivity", "data analysis", "technicians", but phrasing such as "help them to analysis different data" shows remaining issues.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 18/25 - Noticeable improvement: many subject-verb agreement and article errors were fixed. Sentence variety is somewhat improved. However, grammatical mistakes persist in some sentences and some awkward constructions remain.
  - Evidence: Better: "automation enhances" and "machines need regular check-ups"; remaining issues: "Then the company will require more people to help them to analysis different data..."

- **Revised Essay Total: 80/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +14 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clearer, stronger thesis that previews the three supporting points.
  - Improved topic sentence and clearer structure in the first paragraph; paragraph content is more coherent and aligned with thesis.
  - General reduction in basic spelling and many grammar errors; vocabulary choices are more appropriate and academic in tone.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Provide concrete examples, data, or brief evidence to support claims (e.g., cite types of IT roles, examples of companies shifting to automation).
  - Further polish sentence-level errors and awkward phrasing (e.g., "help them to analysis" → "help them analyze").
  - Improve transitions between sentences and paragraphs to strengthen logical flow and avoid repetition.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9 messages** (assistant and user messages combined).
- **Conversation Quality:** Focused and structured. The assistant provided a clear revision plan and rubric-based diagnosis. The student selected revision targets (thesis and grammar) and confirmed the revised thesis and choice of paragraph. Interaction shows goal-setting and targeted revision but limited iterative cycles and limited critical scrutiny of AI suggestions.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Developing.
  - Justification: The chat contains a focused, goal-oriented exchange with nine messages. The student and assistant negotiate targets and follow a structured three-step process. However, the exchange is short of the extended back-and-forth (multiple cycles of revision and refinement) that indicates an in-depth conversation (15+ messages).
  - Evidence: The assistant outlines steps and gives diagnostics; the student selects targets ("A, B") and confirms the thesis, but there are only a few turns of revision.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 - Developing.
  - Justification: The student did evaluate options by choosing which targets to pursue and by confirming the assistant's suggested thesis sentence. However, there is little evidence of the student challenging or providing detailed justification for accepting/rejecting specific AI suggestions.
  - Evidence: Student chose "A, B" and later replied "yes" to the proposed thesis; the student offered a topic-sentence attempt but did not justify why particular wording was preferred or rejected.
- **Refining Process**: 3/5 - Developing.
  - Justification: The student followed the assistant's prescribed steps (thesis confirmation, choosing a paragraph, attempting a topic sentence). There was at least one clear revision (thesis and the revised essay reflect paragraph edits). But there were few iterative cycles and limited evidence of multiple substantial revisions driven by student critique.
  - Evidence: Assistant asked for a revised thesis and topic sentence; student confirmed thesis and provided a topic-sentence attempt; the final revised essay shows applied changes but the chat shows limited rounds of back-and-forth edits.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 9/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear engagement with the AI's structured process — the student set revision goals and followed the assistant's three-step plan (evidence: student selected targets "A, B" and confirmed the thesis).
- Successful improvement of thesis and paragraph alignment — the final essay contains a clearer thesis that previews main points and a first paragraph with an improved topic sentence.
- Demonstrated ability to accept and apply AI guidance — the revised essay shows concrete adoption of suggested changes (improved thesis, clearer paragraph focus).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Increase critical engagement: when the AI proposes alternatives, the student should evaluate them explicitly (e.g., explain why a suggested phrasing is preferred or ask for alternatives), which will deepen learning.
- Add evidence and specific examples in body paragraphs to move from claims to convincing, supported arguments.
- Continue sentence-level editing and proofreading to eliminate residual grammar and collocation errors (e.g., "help them to analysis" → "help them analyze", "by transferring to automation" → "by shifting to automation").

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the original essay and selected clear revision targets; the assistant had enough context to give targeted feedback.
  - Evidence: Student uploaded the draft and chose goals ("stronger topic sentences, clearer... grammar and sentence structure").
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student followed a logical plan (revise thesis, then revise paragraph) and stuck to agreed steps.
  - Evidence: Student confirmed the thesis and chose the first paragraph for editing.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student accepted recommendations but provided limited critique or justification when accepting AI suggestions.
  - Evidence: The student replied "yes" to the assistant's suggested thesis without proposing revisions or asking alternatives.
- **Independent Editing**: Developing - The student attempted revisions (as seen in the revised essay) but would benefit from more independent iteration and self-explanation of choices.
  - Evidence: The revised essay shows changes, but the chat shows few self-initiated revision cycles.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Add at least one concrete example or brief data point in each body paragraph to support claims (e.g., name a role created by automation, or a common maintenance job type) — this will strengthen content and credibility.
2. Do a targeted grammar pass: read sentences aloud, focus on common patterns (subject-verb agreement, verb forms like "analyze" vs. "analysis", article use) and use search-and-replace for repeated mistakes; ask the AI to produce a corrected version and explain changes.
3. Engage more critically with AI suggestions: when the assistant offers alternatives, explicitly state which you accept or reject and why. Request multiple phrasing options and choose the best, explaining your choice to deepen revision skills.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student completed the three required revision tasks: thesis revision, topic-sentence revision, and at least one revised body paragraph. The revised essay demonstrates measurable improvement (from 66 to 80), indicating productive use of the AI-assisted workflow.
- Remaining issues are primarily at the sentence level (some awkward phrasing and grammar) and in evidential support for claims. Encourage the student to add brief examples and to run at least one more revision pass focused solely on sentence-level accuracy and concision.
- Recommend the student be encouraged to document a short reflection in future activities describing which AI suggestions they accepted/rejected and why — this will support the development of critical evaluation skills in human-AI collaboration.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
   The technologion shift ultimately enhance global empolyment prospects in long term.
    First of all, although some of the jobs is reducing due to automation, making the requirment of labour being lower than before, automation increase the profession of a company. Since the automation machines required talents with high education level in IT or data science. For those employees, there are not only local market for them, but also in global market. Talents can go to other countries to have a job. The transfer of automation is favouring those IT talent by enlarging their job market.

Secondly, by transferring to be automation, the data analysis of a company can be enhanced. By using automatic machines, most data can be transferred to quantitative data for company. Then  the company will require more people to help them to analysis different data such as their sale data, market data, etc. This helps the company to improve their products and make investment in a correct way. This creates more job opportunities for people who are professional in data analysis,  creativity and marketing because those talents are needed by those companies in large amount of them. 

Last but not least, the automation transferring, makes the companies required talents in improving or fixing machines. As the relability of machines of those companies, they will need people to maintain the machines every day and fix the machines as quickest when the machines were broken down. This increases the job opportunities too.

To conclude, the automation enhance global employment prospects in long term by enlarging the employee market of IT talents towards to global. Also, the talents of other aspects such as marketing , creactivity and data science will be required more to help companies to make improvement in different ways. The market of semi-skilled labours for maintenance of machines will be enlarged too.

Revised:
  The technological shift ultimately enhances long-term global employment prospects, driving the expansion of skilled IT jobs, increasing demand for data and marketing specialists, and creating more maintenance and semi-skilled roles across industries.
First of all, automation increases the productivity of a company. Although some of the jobs are being reduced due to automation and the requirement for labour being lower than before, the quality of the product can be increased. Since the automation machines require talents with a high education level in IT or data science. For those employees, there is an expanded job market for them, not only a local market, but also in the global market. Talents can go to other countries to have a job. The transfer of automation is favouring IT talent by enlarging their job market.

Secondly, by transferring to automation, the data analysis of a company can be enhanced. By using automatic machines, most data can be transferred to quantitative data for the company. Then the company will require more people to help them to analysis different data such as their sales data, market data, etc. This helps the company to improve its products and make investments in the correct way. This creates more job opportunities for people who are professional in data analysis,  creativity and marketing because those talents are needed by those companies in large amount of them. 

Last but not least, as companies shift to automation, they still need people who can improve and fix the machines. Even if the systems are reliable, machines need regular check-ups and quick repairs when something goes wrong. This creates more demand for technicians and maintenance workers, which means more job opportunities too.

To conclude, automation enhances global employment prospects in the long term by enlarging the employee market of IT talents towards to global. Also, the talents of other aspects such as marketing, creativity and data science will be required more to help companies to make improvements in different ways. The market of semi-skilled labourers for the maintenance of machines will be enlarged too.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:00:46.293Z

**You:** First of all, although some of the jobs is reducing due to automation, making the requirment of labour being lower than before, automation increase the profession of a company

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:04:01.612Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m glad you’ve shared your draft. Before we begin revising, let’s agree learning targets and diagnose the essay so we focus on what matters most to you.

1) Quick check-in — your goals
- What do you want to improve most today? (Choose any that apply or add your own)
  - clarity of thesis and overall argument
  - paragraph structure and logical flow
  - stronger topic sentences
  - clearer, more precise vocabulary (academic tone)
  - grammar and sentence structure (accuracy and variety)
  - evidence and development (examples, explanation)

Tell me which 1–2 of these you most want to focus on in this session.

2) Diagnostic feedback (brief, rubric-based)
I reviewed your draft and here’s a short diagnosis aligned to the rubric categories.

- Content and Ideas
  - Strengths: Clear overall stance (you argue automation ultimately enhances employment) and you give three clear idea areas (IT/global jobs, data analysis, machine maintenance).
  - Areas to improve: Ideas are basic and need clearer explanation and stronger, specific support. The thesis is unclear and grammatically weak, so the reader can’t easily see the argument’s scope or organization.
  - Rough rubric level: Developing (3)

- Organisation and Logical Progression
  - Strengths: Essay has an introduction, three body paragraphs, and a conclusion — a solid basic structure.
  - Areas to improve: Paragraphs need clearer topic sentences that link directly to a stronger thesis; transitions are weak; some sentences within paragraphs jump between ideas.
  - Rough rubric level: Developing (3)

- Vocabulary
  - Strengths: Attempts to use academic terms (automation, data analysis, maintenance).
  - Areas to improve: Many word-choice errors and misspellings reduce clarity (e.g., technologion, empolyment, requirment). Use more precise academic vocabulary and correct spelling.
  - Rough rubric level: Basic–Developing (2–3)

- Grammar and Sentence Structure
  - Strengths: Mostly simple sentence structures that convey basic meaning.
  - Areas to improve: Frequent grammar errors (subject-verb agreement, article use, plural/singular, word order) and awkward phrasing; sentence variety is limited.
  - Rough rubric level: Basic (2)

3) Suggested revision priorities (pick which you want to focus on)
Based on your goals and the diagnosis, I suggest choosing up to two targets for today’s revision. Here are options:
- A: Revise and strengthen the thesis so it clearly answers the question and previews main points.
- B: Improve grammar and sentence accuracy in key sentences (especially the thesis and one paragraph).
- C: Strengthen one body paragraph’s topic sentence and internal coherence (connect it tightly to the thesis).
- D: Improve vocabulary and word choice in the selected paragraph.

Which would you like to focus on? Also tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (first, second, or third).

Once you confirm targets and which paragraph, we’ll start Step 1: please paste or confirm your current thesis sentence (I see: “The technologion shift ultimately enhance global empolyment prospects in long term.” — is this the thesis you want to revise?).

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:04:15.438Z

**You:** 1. stronger topic sentences, clearer, more precise vocabulary, grammar and sentence structure 2. Clear overall stance 3. A, B

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:17:24.241Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for your clear choices. I’ll summarize what we’ve agreed and then we’ll start.

Confirmed targets
- Primary goals: A (revise and strengthen the thesis) and B (improve grammar and sentence accuracy in key sentences).
- You also want stronger topic sentences and clearer, more precise vocabulary — we’ll keep those in mind when we edit the paragraph you choose.

One quick question before we begin Step 1
Which body paragraph would you like to work on for Step 2 and Step 3: the first (about IT/global jobs), the second (about data analysis and marketing), or the third (about machine maintenance)? Pick one.

Brief feedback on your current thesis
Your current sentence — “The technologion shift ultimately enhance global empolyment prospects in long term.” — shows your main stance (automation helps employment long-term), which is good. But it needs work:
- Spelling and grammar: technologion → technological; empolyment → employment; subject-verb agreement and article/phrase issues (e.g., “shift ultimately enhances employment prospects in the long term”).
- Clarity and scope: it does not preview the main points (the three reasons in your essay). A stronger thesis should state your position and briefly preview the main reasons you will discuss.
- Tone: use confident, precise language (avoid hedging).

Step 1 — Your turn: Please try rewriting the thesis now
Please write one revised thesis sentence that:
- Clearly answers the question (take a clear position: enhances or undermines).
- Previews 2–3 main points you will discuss (e.g., expansion of skilled IT jobs, increased demand for data/marketing specialists, more maintenance/semi-skilled roles).
- Uses confident, precise language and correct grammar.

If you’d like a short frame to help, try one of these sentence starters (use only if you want a hint):
- “Automation ultimately enhances global employment prospects in the long term by creating more opportunities for skilled IT workers, increasing demand for data and marketing specialists, and expanding maintenance and semi-skilled roles.”
- “In the long term, automation will improve global employment prospects because it expands international markets for IT talent, creates new roles in data analysis and creative industries, and increases demand for machine maintenance workers.”

Would you like to try writing a thesis now? Once you post your revised thesis, I’ll give focused feedback and—when you’re satisfied—we’ll move to the paragraph you picked.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:17:38.566Z

**You:** step 2

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:26:22.161Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for saying “step 2.” Before we start revising a topic sentence and the paragraph, two quick confirmations so we stay on the agreed workflow:

1) Thesis confirmation
Is this the thesis you want to use for the rest of the revision?
"The technological shift ultimately enhances long-term global employment prospects, driving the expansion of skilled IT jobs, increasing demand for data and marketing specialists, and creating more maintenance and semi-skilled roles across industries."

If yes, reply “Yes — keep this thesis.” If you want one small tweak, tell me what you want changed (e.g., use “automation” instead of “technological shift,” or move “long-term” earlier).

2) Which paragraph shall we work on?
Pick one: first (IT/global jobs), second (data analysis & marketing), or third (maintenance & semi-skilled roles). Then paste the current topic sentence from that paragraph (or just tell me which sentence you want to use as the topic sentence).

After you paste the topic sentence, I’ll give focused feedback on how well it links to the thesis and a couple of short suggestions to strengthen it. Would you like to try revising the topic sentence yourself first, or would you like a brief model example to guide you?

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:26:34.329Z

**You:** yes. first, automation increase the profession of a company

*Time:* 2025-12-07T06:28:19.731Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. I’ll keep your confirmed thesis and work on the first paragraph.

Quick confirmation
- Thesis kept: Yes — we’ll use the sentence you confirmed as the thesis for the rest of the revision.
- Paragraph: first (about IT/global jobs).
- Current topic sentence you gave: “first, automation increase the profession of a company”

Feedback on that topic sentence
- Grammar: use subject–verb agreement — “automation increases,” not “increase.”
- Capitalization: begin sentences with a capital letter — “First,” or “First of all,”.
- Clarity: the phrase “increase the profession of a company” is vague and unclear. What do you mean by “profession”? Jobs? Productivity? Competitiveness?
- Link to thesis: the topic sentence should clearly show how this paragraph supports the thesis (e.g., that automation expands skilled IT jobs and global opportunities).
- Focus: make the sentence specific (who benefits, what kind of jobs, and how this change connects to global employment).

Would you like to try revising that topic sentence now? Try to:
- Start with “First,” or “First of all,”
- Use “automation increases…” (or “As companies automate, …”)
- Say specifically what increases (e.g., demand for IT professionals, productivity that creates new roles)
- Show briefly how this supports the thesis (e.g., expands job markets for skilled workers)

If you want a bit more help, choose one of these short sentence starters/frames to complete (fill the blanks with your ideas):
- “First, automation increases __________, which creates greater demand for __________ and expands __________.” 
- “First, as companies adopt automation, they require more __________ to __________, so __________.”
- “First, automation drives __________ in companies, leading to increased opportunities for __________ in global markets.”

Try one revision now, and I’ll give focused feedback and a quick grammar check.
