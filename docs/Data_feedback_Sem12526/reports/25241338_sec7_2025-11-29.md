            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks — here is the final revised version of your essay. I fixed grammar, vocabulary, clarity, and coherence while keeping your original ideas and the thesis you chose.

---

Nowadays, automation is increasingly common, especially in industry. It can improve production efficiency and reduce costs, but many people fear that it will lead to job losses and higher unemployment. While automation may boost industrial productivity in the short term, it will ultimately worsen global employment prospects because it directly replaces workers and creates a skills mismatch.

Automation can enhance productivity and cost efficiency, but it will replace many manufacturing workers. For example, automated systems allow firms to produce more goods with fewer staff, and they lower labour and equipment costs. As a result, the number of employees in certain sectors will decline over time. As technology advances, demand for routine workers will fall, causing widespread job losses. Therefore, automation will worsen employment prospects for large groups of low-skilled workers.

Moreover, many displaced workers are unable to move into the new jobs that automation creates because they lack the necessary skills and training. Many workers do not have access to retraining programmes, so they struggle to find alternative employment in other sectors. For example, firms increasingly require specific technical skills for emerging roles, which many displaced workers do not possess. Because many people lack educational opportunities, they cannot acquire the skills needed for available jobs, and so they are left at a disadvantage.

In short, automation will negatively affect global employment because it both replaces workers and leaves many unable to secure new roles. To reduce this harm, policymakers and employers should invest in education and retraining programmes so that displaced workers can acquire the skills required for emerging jobs.

Would you like me to do a final copy-edit for punctuation and any remaining small grammar issues, or to help you expand this into a longer essay with more examples and citations?

            ## 🟤 Grading Result *(Hidden from Students)*

            All three targeted tasks were completed:
- Revised the thesis statement: Yes (student wrote: “While automation may boost industrial productivity in the short term, it will ultimately worsen global employment prospects because of direct replacement and skill mismatch.”)
- Revised a topic sentence: Yes (e.g., “Automation can enhance productivity and cost efficiency, but it will replace manufacturing workers.” and for paragraph 2: “Moreover, many displaced workers are unable to move into new jobs because of the limited skills.”)
- Revised one of the body paragraphs: Yes (first body paragraph was revised sentence-by-sentence and the second body paragraph was also revised through multiple iterations)

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 15/25 - The original shows awareness of automation vs employment but is internally inconsistent (thesis claims long-term benefits while body argues job loss). Ideas are underdeveloped and sometimes unclear (e.g., “this paper argues that this technological shift enhance global employment prospects” contradicts paragraphs).
- Organization: 14/25 - Paragraphs exist but lack clear topic sentences and unity; logical progression is weak (claims jump and contradict).
- Vocabulary: 13/25 - Word choice is often imprecise or informal (“stuffs,” “labours,” “someone”); repeated misuse of terms.
- Grammar: 10/25 - Frequent grammatical errors (verb forms, articles, plural/singular confusion, run‑ons) that impede clarity (examples: “It could not against AI automation…”, “ta produce”, “didn't have a chance of education”).
- **Original Essay Total: 52/100**

Evidence (original):
- Thesis contradiction: “Although automation is strongly useful for industries, this paper argues that this technological shift enhance global employment prospects in the long term.” (poor grammar + inconsistent claim)
- Example of grammar/vocab problems: “It could not against AI automation could definitely bring lots of benefits to industries.”; “ta produce more stuffs”.

#### Revised Essay Scores:
(Assessment based on the student's revised draft and the final polished draft produced during tutoring)
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised thesis is clear and consistent: “While automation may boost industrial productivity in the short term, it will ultimately worsen global employment prospects because of direct replacement and skill mismatch.” The essay now develops two clear reasons (direct replacement; skills mismatch) and includes a recommendation in the conclusion.
- Organization: 21/25 - Paragraph-level structure improved: clear topic sentence for the first body paragraph and an articulated second-paragraph topic sentence; logical links and transitions were added (For example → As technology advances → Therefore).
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - Vocabulary is more precise (“production efficiency,” “labour and equipment costs,” “retraining programmes”). Some repetition and room for more academic register remain but overall improved.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 20/25 - Many sentence-level errors were fixed; sentence structures are clearer and more grammatically correct. A few minor punctuation/spacing issues were corrected in tutoring; remaining areas are minor.
- **Revised Essay Total: 82/100**

Evidence (revised):
- Confirmed thesis: “While automation may boost industrial productivity in the short term, it will ultimately worsen global employment prospects because it directly replaces workers and creates a skills mismatch.”
- Improved paragraph/topic sentences: “Automation can enhance productivity and cost efficiency, but it will replace many manufacturing workers.”; “Moreover, many displaced workers are unable to move into new jobs because of the limited skills.”
- Concluding recommendation: “To reduce this harm, policymakers and employers should invest in education and retraining programmes so that displaced workers can acquire the skills required for emerging jobs.”

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +30 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clarified and made the thesis consistent with the body (student rewrote thesis to state long-term harms rather than benefits).
  - Strengthened paragraph structure: topic sentences introduced and supporting sentences were made coherent and causal (e.g., production efficiency → fewer staff → job losses).
  - Improved grammar and vocabulary substantially: corrected many verb, article, and collocation errors; replaced informal words with academic equivalents.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Provide stronger, concrete evidence or examples (statistics, case studies, or citations) to substantiate claims—e.g., citation or specific industry examples to support “widespread job losses.”
  - More varied sentence structures and higher-level academic vocabulary to reach an “Excellent” category.
  - Further smoothing of transitions and a brief, explicit counterargument paragraph could strengthen rhetorical balance (acknowledge and rebut the view that automation creates net jobs).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 53** messages (extensive, iterative conversation: multiple assistant prompts and many user rewrites).
- **Conversation Quality:** Highly iterative and scaffolded. The assistant followed a stepwise revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → sentence-level edits → conclusion). The student responded with multiple self-generated revisions and accepted/refined AI guidance. The chat shows sustained engagement across the entire revision process.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - Evidence: 53 messages, stepwise multi-turn process, detailed diagnosis and iterative edits (e.g., Step 1 thesis rewrite, Step 2 topic-sentence revisions, Step 3 sentence-by-sentence paragraph edits, concluding revision). The student engaged in repeated, substantive exchanges.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - The student consistently evaluated and chose priorities (structure first, grammar second) and often wrote their own revisions rather than passively accepting suggestions. Example: the assistant offered frames and the student produced multiple independent rewrites (e.g., thesis, topic sentences, paragraph sentences). The student did not frequently reject AI suggestions explicitly; most suggestions were followed—hence proficient rather than fully critical in all cases.
- **Refining Process**: 5/5 - There were multiple meaningful revision cycles: the thesis was revised and confirmed, the first body paragraph was revised sentence-by-sentence, the second paragraph was revised with topic sentence and supporting sentences, and the conclusion was rewritten. Evidence: the assistant requested single-sentence rewrites repeatedly and the student provided them, demonstrating iterative refinement.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 14/15**

Stepwise evidence of refinement:
- The assistant proposed revision frames and the student supplied: thesis (“While automation may boost…”), topic sentences, and sentence-level rewrites (e.g., “Many workers lack access to training, so they struggle to find alternative employment in other sectors.”). The assistant offered corrective feedback, the student applied it, and repeatedly asked to proceed to the next step.

Step 2 specific analyses:
- Conversation Depth Analysis: 53 messages demonstrate depth; questions were substantive (e.g., “Which paragraph?” “Choose two priorities”), and the assistant’s scaffolding elicited targeted student work.
- Critical Thinking Assessment: Student made choices (kept thesis, selected paragraph to work on, chose to revise conclusion) and occasionally suggested preferences (e.g., structure first). They rarely contested AI recommendations in detail but did make independent drafting choices.
- Revision Strategy Evaluation: Clear iterative process—thesis → paragraph 1 topic sentence → supporting sentences → paragraph 2 topic sentence → supporting sentences → conclusion → final polished essay.
- Context Provision Assessment: The student provided clear learning goals at the start (“I want to improve my structure and grammar skills”), which helped the assistant tailor feedback. Course-specific context was limited but sufficient for the task.

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Consistent engagement and persistence: Student actively participated in many iterative cycles, supplying multiple rewrites and responding to targeted prompts (e.g., produced new thesis, topic sentences, and sentence-level edits).
- Improved structure and clarity: The final draft demonstrates clear thesis, logical paragraphing, and causal links (productivity → fewer workers → job losses).
- Use of AI as a tutor rather than a ghostwriter: The student wrote their own sentences, applied feedback, and made explicit choices about priorities and scope.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Evidence and development: Add concrete examples, statistics, or citation to strengthen arguments (e.g., automation impacts in specific sectors).
- Rhetorical balance: Briefly engage and rebut the counterargument more fully (acknowledge job creation or transition opportunities and explain why they may be insufficient).
- Final copy-editing and stylistic polish: A final pass to fix minor punctuation spacing and to increase sentence variety and academic tone would raise the essay into the 90+ band.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - Student stated learning goals early (“structure and grammar”) and confirmed priorities during the session.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student accepted and followed a stepwise plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph → conclusion) and made deliberate scope decisions.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good/Proficient - The student accepted most suggestions but actively selected and adapted frames; however, they did not frequently critique AI suggestions in depth.
- **Independent Editing**: Excellent - The student repeatedly drafted their own sentences and improved them in response to feedback, demonstrating growing self-editing skills.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Add specific evidence: include statistics, industry examples, or brief citations to substantiate claims about job displacement or job creation.
2. Strengthen rebuttal and nuance: add a short paragraph acknowledging how automation can create jobs and then explain why, given skills and access constraints, displacement remains the dominant concern.
3. Final copy-edit and stylistic variation: perform one more pass to fix remaining punctuation/spaces and to vary sentence length/complexity to raise academic tone.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student met the module’s revision tasks and demonstrated strong engagement with the AI tutor: they revised thesis, topic sentences, at least two paragraphs, and the conclusion through iterative practice.
- The student largely used AI as a coach (received frames, wrote own sentences) — this indicates good learning behavior and developing independent editing skills.
- Consider asking the student to add one or two concrete examples (e.g., automation in automotive manufacturing or retail checkout automation) and a one-paragraph rebuttal to further demonstrate critical thinking and research skill.

If you would like, I can:
- Provide a final copy-edit of the current essay for punctuation and micro-style, or
- Suggest two concrete, short examples and one source to cite that would strengthen the essay’s evidence.

However, the numbers of employees will fall in the long term. Because of the stronger technology, labours could be replaced that global employment must become a serious issue.

In addition, someone may mention that even if automation better than labours, they can be still used in other places, instead of industries.But there are not all peope have so many skills for doing other jobs. For example, business need someone who is clever and learnt some related skills so that they can useful in the companies.In this world, there are too many people didn't have a chance of education, so they find jobs more difficultly. Thus, global employment would enhance because of automation.

Although automation is good for industries, it is not good for employees that it affect their opportunties and their lives.So it should be concerned as a serious problem.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:13:08.697Z

**You:** I want to improve my structure and grammar skills in my essay.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:14:16.827Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for telling me you want to improve structure and grammar. That helps me tailor my feedback. Before we begin the three-step revision process, let’s negotiate targets and diagnose your essay so we both agree what to work on.

1) Confirming learning targets
- You said: improve structure and grammar. Do you also want to focus on:
  - making the thesis clearer and preview the essay’s main points? (yes / no)
  - improving paragraph-level organization (clear topic sentences + unity)? (yes / no)
  - correcting sentence-level grammar (verb forms, articles, word choice)? (yes / no)

Tell me which of the three above you want to prioritize (you can pick two). Once you confirm, I’ll give a short diagnostic and we’ll decide which paragraph to revise.

2) Quick diagnostic feedback (short — using the rubric categories you were given)

Strengths
- Clear general topic: automation and employment — reader knows the issue.
- Attempts to present both sides (benefits vs job loss).
- Some attempts at examples and linking sentences.

Areas to improve (linked to your targets: structure & grammar)
- Thesis & Argument (Content and Ideas)
  - Diagnosis: The thesis is unclear and inconsistent. It claims automation helps employment in the long term, but the body paragraphs say employment will fall. The thesis should state a clear, consistent position and preview the main reasons.
- Organisation and Logical Progression
  - Diagnosis: Paragraphing is present but topic sentences are weak. Paragraphs lack clear logical progression and unity (some sentences don’t clearly support the paragraph’s main idea).
- Vocabulary
  - Diagnosis: Frequent informal/incorrect word choices (e.g., “ta produce,” “stuffs,” “labours”). Choose more precise, academic vocabulary.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure
  - Diagnosis: Many grammar errors (verb forms, articles, plural/singular, punctuation). Sentence structures are often unclear or run-on.

3) Student priority selection
Which issue(s) from the diagnoses above do you want to focus on in this session? (Choose up to two; for example: “thesis clarity + first body paragraph’s structure and grammar.”)

Also: Which body paragraph would you like to revise? I recommend the first body paragraph (the one that begins: “It could not against AI automation could definitely bring lots of benefits…”), because it contains important claims and many structural/grammar problems. Do you want to work on that one? (yes / no)

When you confirm your chosen priorities and paragraph, we’ll begin Step 1: thesis revision.

Step 1 (ready to start once you confirm)
- Please read this: I’ll ask you to share your current thesis (you already did, but please confirm that is the sentence you want to revise). I’ll give clear feedback and then I’ll ask you to try rewriting it.
- Quick feedback on your current thesis: “Although automation is strongly useful for industries, this paper argues that this technological shift enhance global employment prospects in the long term.”
  - Issues to fix:
    - Grammar: “enhance” should be “enhances” (or use “will enhance”), and “strongly useful” is awkward.
    - Clarity/consistency: The thesis claims long-term employment benefits but the essay’s body paragraphs contradict that. Decide a consistent position.
    - Focus/preview: The thesis does not preview the main reasons (e.g., job transformation, new industries, increased productivity, retraining).
    - Tone: Avoid “this paper argues” phrasing; use direct, confident phrasing.

- Checklist for a stronger thesis (use this to rewrite):
  1. State a clear position (agree, disagree, or partly agree).
  2. Briefly acknowledge the counterargument (short-term job losses).
  3. Preview 2–3 main reasons you will discuss (e.g., job transformation, creation of new industries, retraining/education).
  4. Use confident, grammatical language and keep it one sentence if possible.

- Helpful sentence frame (use to help you, but please try to write your own):
  - Frame: “While automation may cause short‑term job losses, I argue that it will ultimately [main claim], because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using that checklist and frame? Paste your revised thesis and I’ll give targeted feedback and, once you’re happy with it, we’ll move to Step 2 (choose the paragraph and its topic sentence).

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:14:39.735Z

**You:** I my priority is looking for the structure then correct the grammar.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:18:45.013Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. Your priority is clear: structure first, then grammar. Let’s lock that in and start.

1) Confirming the specific targets (choose two)
I suggest we focus on:
- A: Thesis clarity and preview of main points (structure)
- B: Paragraph-level organization (clear topic sentence + unity)

Grammar (sentence-level accuracy) will be a secondary target that we fix as we revise the paragraph you choose. Do you agree with A + B? (yes / no)

2) Which paragraph to revise?
I recommend the first body paragraph (the one that begins “It could not against AI automation could definitely bring lots of benefits…”). Do you want to work on that paragraph? (yes / no)

Once you confirm A + B and the paragraph, we’ll begin Step 1.

Step 1 — Thesis revision (ready after you confirm)
Please confirm that this is the thesis you want to revise:
“Although automation is strongly useful for industries, this paper argues that this technological shift enhance global employment prospects in the long term.”

Quick feedback on this thesis (short, actionable):
- Grammar: “enhance” → “enhances” or “will enhance”; “strongly useful” is awkward.
- Tone: avoid “this paper argues”; use a direct, confident stance.
- Consistency: Your thesis says employment prospects improve long‑term, but the body currently argues job losses. Decide one clear position.
- Preview: Add 2–3 brief reasons you will develop (e.g., job transformation, new industries, retraining/education).

Try rewriting your thesis now using this frame:
“While automation may cause short-term job losses, I argue that it will ultimately [main claim], because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”

Would you like to try rewriting it now? Paste your new thesis and I’ll give quick, focused feedback.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:18:57.464Z

**You:** I agree with A+B and I want to revise paragraph 2

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:20:12.600Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for confirming A + B and choosing the first body paragraph (the one that begins “It could not against AI automation…”). We’ll focus on thesis clarity/preview and paragraph-level organization; we’ll fix grammar as we revise the paragraph.

Step 1 — Thesis revision (your turn)
You earlier gave this thesis:
“Although automation is strongly useful for industries, this paper argues that this technological shift enhance global employment prospects in the long term.”

Quick checklist before you rewrite (use this to self-check):
- Do you state a clear position? (agree / disagree / partly agree)
- Do you briefly acknowledge the counterargument (short-term job losses)?  
- Do you preview 2–3 reasons you will develop in the essay?  
- Is the sentence grammatical and confident (no “this paper argues” or hedging)?

Helpful frame you can use:
“While automation may cause short‑term job losses, I argue that it will ultimately [main claim], because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using that checklist and frame? Paste your new sentence and I’ll give quick, focused feedback. If you prefer, I can show one model thesis after you try—what would you like?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:20:19.995Z

**You:** Although automation is useful for industries, I argue that it will worsen the global employment in the long term because of direct replacement and skill mismatch.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:24:17.228Z

**Assistant:** Good—nice work. This version already shows a clear position and two supporting reasons. Small changes will make it stronger and more academic.

Quick, focused feedback
- Strengths: clear stance (automation will worsen employment); you name two reasons (direct replacement, skill mismatch).
- Fixes to make:
  - Word choice/grammar: say “worsen global employment prospects” or “reduce global employment,” not “worsen the global employment.”
  - Word order: put “in the long term” earlier or set it apart more clearly: “In the long term, automation will…”
  - Tone: avoid “I argue that” if you want a more direct academic tone (both are acceptable—choose one).
  - Preview: you have two reasons—consider adding a third (e.g., limited retraining or unequal access to education) if you plan to discuss it, or keep two but be explicit they are the main reasons.

Try this revision step
Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using one of these frames?
- Strong direct: “In the long term, automation will worsen global employment prospects because it directly replaces workers and creates a widespread skills mismatch.”
- With counterpoint: “While automation may boost industrial productivity in the short term, it will ultimately worsen global employment prospects because it replaces workers and creates a skills mismatch that many cannot overcome.”

Please paste your next version. Once you’re happy with it, we’ll confirm and move to Step 2 (the topic sentence for the first body paragraph).

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:24:30.943Z

**You:** “While automation may boost industrial productivity in the short term, it will ultimately worsen global employment prospects because of direct replacement and skill mismatch.”This is my confirmed thesis.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:27:09.052Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that thesis is much clearer and matches a consistent position. Quick feedback before we move on:

- Strengths: clear stance; previews two reasons (direct replacement, skills mismatch); concise and academic tone.
- Small suggestion (optional): consider pluralizing “skill mismatch” → “skills mismatch” or adding “limited access to retraining” if you plan to discuss education later. Both are fine—your sentence is already strong.

Please confirm: are you happy to keep this exact thesis? If yes, we’ll move to Step 2.

Because you confirmed a change, here is your full essay with the updated thesis inserted (no other edits yet):

---
Nowadays, automation is more popular, especially in industries. It could help in fostering the efficiency of producing. However, someone argues that automation will lead to reduce jobs, which rises the rate of employment. While automation may boost industrial productivity in the short term, it will ultimately worsen global employment prospects because of direct replacement and skill mismatch.

It could not against AI automation could definitely bring lots of benefits to industries. For instance, automation can improve the efficiency ta produce more stuffs in order to enhance the profits and revenues. Also, it could reduce the costs, such as the machines and labours.

Thus, global employment would enhance because of automation.

Although automation is good for industries, it is not good for employees that it affect their opportunties and their lives.So it should be concerned as a serious problem.
---

Step 2 — Topic sentence revision (first body paragraph)
We will work on the first body paragraph (the one beginning “It could not against AI automation…”). Please do one of the following:

- Option A (recommended): Try rewriting the paragraph’s topic sentence now so it clearly connects to the thesis. A good topic sentence should state this paragraph’s main point and show how it supports the thesis (e.g., focus on direct replacement of workers).
- Option B: Paste the current topic sentence you want to revise, and I’ll guide you to improve it.

Guiding frame you can use to write the topic sentence (try it yourself first):
“One major way automation harms employment is by directly replacing workers who perform routine tasks.”

Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence now? Paste your attempt and I’ll give focused feedback and help you strengthen the connection to your thesis.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:27:25.481Z

**You:** Yes, I confirm the thesis.

“Automation can enhance productivity and cost efficiency, but it will affect manufacturing workers who may lose jobs.”This is my new topic sentence

**Assistant:** Nice work — this topic sentence already connects to your thesis and shows the paragraph’s direction. First, I’ll paste your essay with your new topic sentence included (you made a change, so I’ve updated the full text). Then I’ll give quick, focused feedback and ask you to try one more revision.

Full essay with your new topic sentence inserted:

Nowadays, automation is more popular, especially in industries. It could help in fostering the efficiency of producing. However, someone argues that automation will lead to reduce jobs, which rises the rate of employment. While automation may boost industrial productivity in the short term, it will ultimately worsen global employment prospects because of direct replacement and skill mismatch.

Automation can enhance productivity and cost efficiency, but it will affect manufacturing workers who may lose jobs. It could not against AI automation could definitely bring lots of benefits to industries. For instance, automation can improve the efficiency ta produce more stuffs in order to enhance the profits and revenues. Also, it could reduce the costs, such as the machines and labours. However, the numbers of employees will fall in the long term. Because of the stronger technology, labours could be replaced that global employment must become a serious issue.

In addition, someone may mention that even if automation better than labours, they can be still used in other places, instead of industries.But there are not all peope have so many skills for doing other jobs. For example, business need someone who is clever and learnt some related skills so that they can useful in the companies.In this world, there are too many people didn't have a chance of education, so they find jobs more difficultly. Thus, global employment would enhance because of automation.

Although automation is good for industries, it is not good for employees that it affect their opportunties and their lives.So it should be concerned as a serious problem.

Quick feedback on your topic sentence
- Strengths
  - It links productivity/cost efficiency to worker impact — good connection to your thesis.
  - It clearly signals the paragraph will discuss job losses among manufacturing workers.

- What to improve (keep these targeted and short)
  1. Be more precise and stronger: replace vague verbs like “affect” with clearer verbs such as “displace,” “replace,” or “lead to job losses.”
  2. Be specific about which workers: consider “routine manufacturing workers” or “low‑skilled manufacturing workers” if that’s what you mean.
  3. Tone and certainty: “may lose jobs” is tentative. If your thesis takes a firm stance (it will worsen employment), align the topic sentence (use “will” or “are likely to” depending on whether you want a strong or cautious claim).
  4. Connect explicitly to the thesis language: since your thesis mentions “direct replacement,” echo that phrase or the idea for coherence.

Small editing suggestions (you don’t need to use these exactly; try your own first)
- Replace “affect” with: displace / replace / cause job losses among
- Replace “may lose jobs” with: will lose jobs / are likely to lose their jobs / face significant job losses

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now? Try one short sentence that:
- States the paragraph’s main point clearly,
- Uses stronger verbs and more precise vocabulary,
- Matches the tone of your thesis (firm or cautious).

If you’d like a quick model to copy or adapt, I can show one — but first, would you like to try rewriting it yourself?

**You:** “Automation can enhance productivity and cost efficiency, but it will replace manufacturing workers who are likely to lose their jobs.”This is my updated topic sentence.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T10:35:42.631Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — your topic sentence is clear and connects well to the thesis. Quick, focused feedback and next steps.

Feedback on your topic sentence
- Strengths: It directly links productivity gains to job losses and fits your thesis. Tone is appropriate for an academic essay.
- One small improvement to consider (you don’t have to change it): the phrase “will replace manufacturing workers who are likely to lose their jobs” is a little redundant — “replace manufacturing workers” already implies job loss. You can keep it as is, or tighten it later.

Because you made a change, here is the full essay with your updated topic sentence included (no other edits yet):

Step 3 — Revising the rest of the chosen paragraph (next action)
We’ll revise the first body paragraph’s supporting sentences for clarity, unity, and grammar. Let’s work one sentence at a time so you practice and learn.

Which sentence would you like to revise first?
- I recommend starting with the sentence immediately after your topic sentence: “It could not against AI automation could definitely bring lots of benefits to industries.” (yes / no)
If yes, try rewriting that single sentence now. Before you try, here are short, concrete tips and useful word choices to help:

Guiding questions as you revise
- Does the sentence clearly support the topic sentence (how automation replaces workers)?
- Is the meaning straightforward (who/what does what)?
- Are verbs and subjects grammatical and in the correct order?
- Do you use precise vocabulary (products, workers, reduce costs) and correct articles/plurals?

Useful word corrections and small phrase suggestions (use these as building blocks — please write your own full sentence)
- “ta produce” → to produce
- “stuffs” → products / goods
- “labours” → labour (uncountable) or workers
- “numbers of employees” → the number of employees
- “someone” (use “some people” or “many argue”) depending on context
- “could reduce the costs, such as the machines and labours” → think: “reduce costs such as labour and machine expenses”

Grammar points to check as you write
- Subject-verb agreement (e.g., “automation can improve” not “automation can improves”)
- Article use (a/an/the where needed)
- Sentence boundaries and spacing after periods
- Avoid run-on sentences; use short, clear clauses

Would you like to try revising that next sentence now? Paste your new version of just that sentence and I’ll give focused edits and then help you move on to the next supporting sentence.

**Assistant:** Nice progress — your thesis and topic sentence are clearer, and you’ve tried revising the supporting sentences. Good effort. Below I paste the full essay with your latest changes, then I give short, sentence-level feedback and small word/phrase suggestions (not full rewrites). After that, please choose one sentence to revise next — I recommend the first ungrammatical sentence in the paragraph. Try one sentence at a time and paste your revision; I’ll give focused feedback.

Sentence-by-sentence feedback for the first body paragraph (short, actionable):

1) Topic sentence: "Automation can enhance productivity and cost efficiency, but it will replace manufacturing workers who are likely to lose their jobs."
- Strengths: Clear connection to thesis; good verb choice ("replace").
- Tiny note: “who are likely to lose their jobs” is redundant; “replace manufacturing workers” already implies job loss. You can keep as is or tighten later.

2) "It could not against AI automation could definitely bring lots of benefits to industries."
- Problems: ungrammatical, confusing word order (“It could not against…”), and vague phrases (“lots of benefits”).
- Short suggestions (use these words/phrases to build your sentence): connectors: “Despite”, “Although”, “Nevertheless”; avoid “could not against”. Try to begin with “Despite these benefits,” or “Although automation brings many benefits,” then follow with your point about job loss.
- Vocabulary to prefer: “benefits” → specific: “productivity gains,” “cost savings,” “efficiency.”

3) "For instance, automation can improve the efficiency to produce more goods in order to enhance the profits and revenues."
- Problems: awkward phrase “efficiency to produce”; “enhance the profits and revenues” is wordy.
- Short suggestions: use “production efficiency” or “efficiency in production”; replace “enhance the profits and revenues” with “increase profits” or “raise revenue.”
- Keep it focused: say how this links to replacing workers (e.g., higher output with fewer staff).

4) "Also, it could reduce the costs such as labour and machine expenses."
- Problems: minor wording; “machine expenses” → “machinery costs” or “equipment costs.”
- Short suggestions: “Also, it can reduce costs such as labour and machinery.”

5) "However, the number of employees will fall in the long term."
- Problems: sentence is okay but a little abrupt. Tie cause and effect more clearly.
- Short suggestions: add a cause link: “As a result, the number of employees will decline in the long term.” Use “decline” or “decrease.”

6) "Because of the stronger technology, the demand of workers would decrease and they could be replaced.So global employment must become a serious issue."
- Problems: several grammar issues and register problems:
  - “stronger technology” → “advanced technology” or “more advanced automation.”
  - “demand of workers” → “demand for workers.”
  - tense/modal clarity: “would decrease” vs “will decrease” — match your thesis tone.
  - missing space after period; “must become a serious issue” is awkward — consider “is a serious concern” or “could become a serious concern.”
- Short suggestions: use “As automation advances, demand for workers will fall, causing widespread job loss. Thus, global employment could become a serious concern.” (This is a model-like suggestion to show structure — but please rephrase in your own words.)

Other quick global notes for this paragraph
- Keep sentences linked: each sentence should show cause → effect → consequence. Use transition words: “Despite,” “For instance,” “Also,” “As a result,” “Thus.”
- Watch articles and prepositions: “the number of employees,” “demand for workers,” “efficiency in production.”
- Use consistent tense/modal verbs to match your thesis (you chose a firm stance: use “will” rather than “could/would” unless you mean to be cautious).

Next step — your action
Which single sentence would you like to edit now? I recommend starting with sentence 2: the ungrammatical one (“It could not against AI automation…”). Try to rewrite only that one sentence using the hints above (begin with “Despite…” or “Although automation brings many benefits, …”). Paste your new version of that single sentence and I’ll give focused feedback and then we’ll move to the next sentence.

**Assistant:** Nice work — you’ve made clear, focused improvements: the topic sentence is stronger, and you tightened several sentences. Let’s keep working sentence by sentence so you learn the edits.

First, here’s your full essay with your latest paragraph included (I haven’t changed anything else):

Quick, focused feedback on the revised first body paragraph (sentence-by-sentence)

1) Topic sentence: "Automation can enhance productivity and cost efficiency, but it will replace manufacturing workers."
- Strong: clear, direct, connected to thesis.
- Minor: choose whether you want a firm stance (will) or softer (are likely to). Keep consistent with the thesis.

2) "Although automation could bring many benefits to industries, for instance, automation can improve the efficiency in production."
- Issues: redundant structure (“Although … for instance” conflicts), repetitive use of “automation,” and awkward phrasing (“efficiency in production” can be improved).
- Tip: Use either a contrast clause OR an example phrase, not both. Try compressing the idea: use a short clause like “Although automation brings benefits such as improved production efficiency, …” or turn the sentence into an explicit example: “For example, automation can improve production efficiency.”

3) "Also, it could reduce the costs such as labour and equipment costs."
- Issues: small repetition (“costs … costs”) and mixed modal verbs (“could” vs. your strong “will”).
- Tip: Prefer “reduce costs such as labour and equipment” or “lower labour and equipment costs.” Use consistent modality with surrounding sentences.

4) "However, the number of employees will fall in the long term."
- Good simple claim. You could make the causal link clearer by adding a short connector: “As a result, the number of employees will decline in the long term.”

5) "Because of the advanced technology, the demand for workers will decline, causing widespread job losses.So global employment could become a serious concern."
- Issues: punctuation/spacing after period, slightly awkward phrasing (“Because of the advanced technology” → “As technology advances”), modal inconsistency again (“will decline” then “could become”).
- Tip: Use consistent modal verbs (“will” if you want firm). Also add a space after the period. Example phrases to reuse: “As technology advances, demand for workers will fall, causing widespread job losses. Thus, global employment will become a serious concern.” (You can adapt this.)

Next step — your action (one sentence at a time)
Which single sentence would you like to revise next? I recommend revising sentence 2 (the one with “Although … for instance …”) because it’s redundant and affects clarity. Try rewriting only that one sentence now.

Helpful micro-guidelines for that sentence
- Choose one structure: contrast (Although...) OR example (For example,...).
- Avoid repeating “automation” twice in the sentence.
- Use concise vocabulary: “production efficiency,” “cost savings,” “productivity.”
- Match modality to the paragraph (use “will” or “can” consistently).

Short frames you can adapt (try writing your own first)
- Contrast frame: “Although automation brings benefits such as improved production efficiency, it still replaces many routine jobs.”
- Example frame: “For example, automation can improve production efficiency, allowing firms to produce more with fewer workers.”

Would you like to try rewriting that sentence now? Paste just the one sentence and I’ll give quick, focused feedback. If you prefer, I can show a model sentence after you try.

Focused feedback on the first body paragraph (very short)
- Main problem: sentence fragment — “Although automation brings many benefits such as improved production efficiency.” This starts a subordinate clause but has no main clause.
- Small issues to fix at the same time:
  - Combine that fragment with the next sentence so the idea is complete.
  - Remove redundancy: avoid “Also” + “such as … costs”; use “reduce costs such as labour and equipment” or “lower labour and equipment costs.”
  - Fix spacing: add a space after the period before “Thus.”
  - Keep modal consistency: you use “will” elsewhere, so keep “will” here for a firm stance.

How to revise (please try this yourself)
- Option A (combine into one sentence): Use a contrast or example structure that completes the idea. Try one of these frames and fill in your words:
  - Frame (contrast): “Although automation brings benefits such as improved production efficiency, it will ___.” 
  - Frame (example): “For example, automation can improve production efficiency and ___ costs such as labour and equipment.”

- Useful verbs/phrases to include: reduce costs, lower labour and equipment costs, replace workers, lead to fewer jobs, increase output with fewer staff.

Would you like to try rewriting just that combined sentence now? Paste only the revised sentence and I’ll give quick, focused feedback.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T11:34:39.239Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this paragraph already shows clearer structure and stronger links to your thesis. Well done choosing a firm stance and making steps to fix the grammar and cohesion.

Quick, focused diagnosis (what still needs attention)
- Sentence fragment: “Although automation brings many benefits such as improved production efficiency.” is incomplete — it needs a main clause.
- Redundancy & word choice: avoid repeating “Also” + “it will” and phrases like “the costs such as labour and equipment” (choose tighter wording).
- Punctuation/spacing: add a space after periods (“.Thus” → “. Thus”) and fix run‑ons.
- Modal consistency: you use “will” elsewhere; keep the same tone (use “will” or “can” consistently).
- Cohesion: link cause → effect clearly (use connectors: As a result / Thus / Therefore).

Which single sentence would you like to revise next?
- My recommendation: fix the fragment (the “Although automation brings many benefits…” sentence) by combining it with the next sentence so the idea is complete and clear.
Would you like to revise that now? If yes, please paste only your revised sentence here.

Helpful frames and words you can use (try writing your own first)
- Contrast frame (combine ideas): “Although automation brings benefits such as improved production efficiency, it will ___ because ___.” 
- Example frame (show example and result): “For example, automation can improve production efficiency and reduce labour and equipment costs, allowing firms to ___.” 
- Useful verbs/phrases: improve production efficiency, reduce costs, lower labour and equipment costs, replace routine workers, allow firms to produce more with fewer employees, as a result/therefore/thus.

What I’ll do next
- I’ll give focused feedback on the single sentence you post and then help you revise the next sentence. If you want, after we finish the paragraph I can insert your confirmed changes into the full essay and show the updated essay.

Two tiny notes (only suggestions — you don’t have to change them now)
- Add a space after periods where missing (I fixed one already). There are other places later (e.g., “…industries.But” and “…companies.In”).
- Consider tightening two small phrases when you’re ready: “reduce jobs” → “reduce the number of jobs” or “cause job losses”; and “the labour and equipment costs” → “labour and equipment costs.” I won’t change these unless you want me to.

Which would you like to do next?
- Revise the second body paragraph (structure + topic sentence and its supporting sentences), or
- Work on sentence-level grammar and punctuation across the whole essay?

Tell me which option (or “other”), and we’ll continue step-by-step.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T11:48:00.776Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for the clear latest draft and for saying you want to revise the second body paragraph. Quick plan: I’ll confirm our targets, give a short diagnosis for that paragraph, and then we’ll follow the three-step process (confirm thesis, revise the paragraph’s topic sentence, then revise the paragraph sentence‑by‑sentence). I’ll guide and encourage you to make each change so you practice — paste each revision and I’ll give focused feedback. Ready? 

1) Confirm targets
You said earlier your main goals are structure and grammar. Do you still want to focus on:
- A: topic-sentence clarity and paragraph-level organisation (structure)? (yes / no)
- B: sentence-level grammar, word choice and punctuation in this paragraph? (yes / no)
(You can pick both; tell me which to prioritise.)

2) Short diagnostic of the second body paragraph (one sentence)
Strength: You try to present a counterargument and give an example about skills and education. 
Main issues to fix (linked to the rubric):
- Organisation: The topic sentence is unclear and the paragraph lacks a clear, single focus (some sentences contradict each other).
- Content & Development: Examples are vague and not fully explained; the logic of how skill gaps cause employment problems needs clearer links.
- Language: Multiple grammar and vocabulary errors (verbs, articles, plural/singular, punctuation, word choice like “labours,” “clever,” “didn’t have a chance of education”).
Target these three things in this order: topic-sentence clarity → unity/cohesion of sentences → grammar.

3) Confirm you want to work on that paragraph
You said “I want to revise the second paragraph.” Confirm: we will only revise the thesis (if you want), one paragraph’s topic sentence, and that paragraph’s content. Do you want to:
- Keep the current thesis as is? (paste/confirm the exact thesis you want to keep), or
- Revisit the thesis now? (yes / no)

Step 1 — Quick thesis check (one question)
Your current thesis in the latest draft is: 
"While automation may boost industrial productivity in the short term, it will ultimately worsen global employment prospects because of direct replacement and skill mismatch."
Are you happy to keep this exact thesis while we revise the second paragraph? (yes / no)

Step 2 — Topic sentence for the second paragraph (your turn)
Which sentence in the paragraph do you want to be the topic sentence? I think it is the first sentence of that paragraph:
"In addition, someone may mention that even if automation better than labours, they can be still used in other places, instead of industries."

Please either:
- A: Confirm that is the topic sentence you want to revise (I’ll then give a short frame), or
- B: Paste the exact sentence you want to revise (if you prefer a different one).

Guiding frame to try (please try to write your own first)
- Frame (direct, clear): “Another problem is that many displaced workers lack the skills to move into the new jobs automation creates.”
- Frame (with consequence): “Although automation creates new roles, many workers cannot access these jobs because they lack relevant skills and training.”

Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence now? Paste just your revised topic sentence (one sentence). I will give a short, focused feedback and then we’ll move to Step 3 and revise the supporting sentences one at a time.

(Quick encouragement: Try one short sentence — don’t worry about perfect grammar yet. I’ll help correct grammar after you write it.)

**You:** Still focusing on structure first and then grammar.keep the thesis in the latest draft.Please revise the topic sentence of second body paragraph first

*Time:* 2025-11-29T11:53:47.841Z

**Assistant:** Great — we’ll keep your thesis as is and focus on structure first (topic-sentence clarity), then grammar. I won’t rewrite the sentence for you; please try one short revision first and I’ll give focused feedback.

Quick diagnosis of the current topic sentence
"In addition, someone may mention that even if automation better than labours, they can be still used in other places, instead of industries."
- Problems: unclear grammar and word choice (e.g., “labours,” “someone,” “they”), weak focus, and it doesn’t clearly state how this idea supports your thesis.
- What the paragraph should do: claim one clear idea (e.g., many displaced workers cannot move into new jobs) and show how that supports your thesis about worsening employment prospects.

How to build a stronger topic sentence (use these building blocks — not a full sentence from me)
- Start with a transition word/phrase: e.g., “However,” “Moreover,” “Another problem is that…”
- State the main claim in clear language: e.g., many displaced workers / low‑skilled workers
- Give the reason or consequence briefly: e.g., lack the skills, limited access to retraining → cannot move into new roles

Short phrase bank you can mix and match
- transition: However / Moreover / Another concern is that
- subject: many displaced workers / low‑skilled workers / affected employees
- verb phrases: lack the necessary skills / cannot access retraining / are unable to move into new roles
- consequence: and so cannot benefit from the new jobs automation creates / which prevents them from finding alternative employment

**You:** Moreover, many displaced workers are unable to move into new jobs because of the limited skills.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T11:58:26.458Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that topic sentence is clear and on target. Good choice of transition word and a direct claim that supports your thesis.

Quick, focused feedback (tiny edits to consider)
- Clarity: “limited skills” is a bit vague. You might prefer phrases like “lack the necessary skills,” “have insufficient skills,” or “have limited access to training.”  
- Precision: consider adding what kind of “new jobs” (e.g., technology, service, or skilled roles) if you plan to explain that later.
- Grammar: the sentence is grammatical, but you could tighten it by removing “the” before “limited skills” if you keep that phrasing (“because they lack necessary skills” or “because of limited skills and training opportunities”).

Are you happy to keep this exact sentence, or would you like to try one small revision now? If you want to revise, try one short change (one sentence) and paste it here — I’ll give focused feedback.

I’ve inserted your topic sentence into the full essay below (no other changes). Read it and tell me which supporting sentence in this paragraph you want to work on first — I recommend the next sentence (the one beginning “In addition, someone may mention…”). Would you like to revise that one now?

Nowadays, automation is more popular, especially in industries. It could help in fostering the efficiency of producing. However, someone argues that automation will lead to reduce jobs, which rises the rate of employment. While automation may boost industrial productivity in the short term, it will ultimately worsen global employment prospects because of direct replacement and skill mismatch.

Automation can enhance productivity and cost efficiency, but it will replace manufacturing workers. Automation brings many benefits such as improved production efficiency. Also, it will reduce the labour and equipment costs. However, the number of employees will decline in the long term. As technology advances, the demand for workers will fall, causing widespread job losses. Thus, global employment will become a serious concern.

Moreover, many displaced workers are unable to move into new jobs because of the limited skills. In addition, someone may mention that even if automation better than labours, they can be still used in other places, instead of industries.But there are not all peope have so many skills for doing other jobs. For example, business need someone who is clever and learnt some related skills so that they can useful in the companies.In this world, there are too many people didn't have a chance of education, so they find jobs more difficultly. Thus, global employment would enhance because of automation.

Although automation is good for industries, it is not good for employees that it affect their opportunties and their lives.So it should be concerned as a serious problem.

Next step (pick one)
- I recommend we revise the next sentence: “In addition, someone may mention that even if automation better than labours, they can be still used in other places, instead of industries.” Would you like to try rewriting that single sentence now?
- If yes, use one of these short frames to help (try your own first):
  - “Some people argue that displaced workers can find other jobs, but …”
  - “Although automation creates new roles, many displaced workers cannot fill them because …”
- Or tell me if you prefer I point out the most important grammar fixes for that sentence first.

Your choice — rewrite the sentence now, or ask for small grammar hints. I’ll support and encourage each step.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T11:58:52.540Z

**You:** “Some people argue that displaced workers can find other jobs, but it is difficult because of limited skills and training opportunities.”
I think we can move on to revise the next sentence

*Time:* 2025-11-29T12:04:22.389Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that sentence (“Some people argue that displaced workers can find other jobs, but it is difficult because of limited skills and training opportunities.”) is clear and connects well to your topic sentence. Good move to keep going.

Next target
I’ll assume you want to revise the sentence that follows it: the draft sentence that reads something like “But there are not all peope have so many skills for doing other jobs.” Please confirm or paste the exact sentence you want to edit.

Before you try, two quick micro-tips to keep in mind
- Grammar: say “not all people have…” (not “there are not all people have”). Use infinitive: “to do other jobs” (not “for doing other jobs”).
- Word choice: use “necessary skills,” “relevant skills,” or “access to training” instead of vague phrases. Fix spelling: “people,” “labour(s).”
- Keep it linked to your topic sentence: show why workers can’t move into new roles (skills + training + access).

Helpful frame options (fill the blanks — don’t copy an entire model sentence from me; try your own first)
- Frame A: “However, not all displaced workers _______ (have / possess) the necessary skills to _______ (move into / take) the new jobs created by automation.”
- Frame B: “Many workers lack _______ (the training / access to retraining / relevant skills), so they _______ (cannot / struggle to) find alternative employment in other sectors.”
- Frame C: “Even when new roles appear, some workers _______ (are unable to / do not have the means to) acquire the skills required, which makes it difficult for them to _______ (change careers / secure new work).”

Try now
Write and paste just your revised single sentence (one sentence only). I’ll give quick, targeted feedback and one small grammar edit, then we’ll move to the next sentence.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T12:04:38.241Z

**You:** Many workers lack access to training, so they cannot struggle to find alternative employment in other sectors.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T12:08:53.143Z

**Assistant:** Good attempt — your sentence has the right idea and stays on topic. Nice work trying to make the connection to training explicit.

Quick, focused feedback
- Main error: “cannot struggle to find” is incorrect. It combines two opposing phrases. Choose one: either “cannot find” (they are unable to find) or “struggle to find” (they have difficulty finding).  
- Keep it simple and parallel with the paragraph’s tone: use either the negative ability (“cannot find”) or the verb “struggle” (+ to find).  
- Small wording: “alternative employment in other sectors” is fine, but you can shorten to “alternative employment” or “jobs in other sectors” if you prefer.

Try one short revision
- Option A (use “struggle”): many workers lack access to training, so they struggle to find alternative employment in other sectors.
- Option B (use “cannot”): many workers lack access to training, so they cannot find alternative employment in other sectors.

Would you like to try rewriting the sentence now using one of those options (in your own words)? Paste only the revised sentence and I’ll give quick feedback.

Next step
- Please choose one: (A) revise that single sentence now using one of the suggested options, or (B) ask me for one very short grammar hint to apply before you rewrite.  
- After you post the revised sentence, I’ll give quick feedback and then we’ll move to the next sentence in this paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T12:09:19.445Z

**You:** I pick option A

*Time:* 2025-11-29T12:10:48.663Z

**Assistant:** Great — go ahead and paste only your revised single sentence (one sentence) here. A quick reminder: choose either “struggle to find” or “cannot find” (not both), and keep it simple, e.g.:

- “Many workers lack access to training, so they struggle to find alternative employment in other sectors.”
or
- “Many workers lack access to training, so they cannot find alternative employment in other sectors.”

Try your own wording first — paste it now and I’ll give focused, friendly feedback.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T12:10:57.850Z

**You:** Many workers lack access to training, so they struggle to find alternative employment in other sectors.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T12:11:35.752Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that sentence is clear, on topic, and links well to your topic sentence. Good choice of phrasing and structure.

Quick, focused feedback on your sentence
- Strength: “lack access to training” and “struggle to find alternative employment” are precise and appropriate for an academic essay.
- Tiny suggestion (optional): you could use “retraining” or “relevant training” if you plan to contrast old skills vs. new skills. Both are fine — no need to change unless you want to.

Because you changed that sentence, here is the full essay with your sentence included (no other edits yet):

Next step — choose the next sentence to revise
I recommend we work on the sentence that begins the example:  
"For example, business need someone who is clever and learnt some related skills so that they can useful in the companies."

Would you like to:
- A — Try rewriting that single sentence now? (recommended), or
- B — Ask for one very short grammar hint before you rewrite?

If you choose A, try one sentence using one of these short frames (please attempt it yourself first):

- Example frame (simple): “For example, companies need workers with relevant technical skills and training to be useful to employers.”
- Cause/result frame: “For example, firms increasingly require workers with specific technical skills, which many displaced workers do not have.”

Hints to help with grammar and word choice
- Subject-verb agreement: “business” → “businesses” or use “companies/firms.”
- Use “need workers with…,” not “need someone who is clever.”
- Use “have learned” or “have the necessary training” rather than “learnt some related skills.”
- “useful in the companies” → “useful to companies” or “useful to employers.”
- Fix spacing after periods (e.g., “…companies.In” → “…companies. In”).

Try rewriting that one sentence and paste it here. I’ll give quick, focused feedback and then we’ll move to the next sentence.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T12:11:58.161Z

**You:** “For example, firms increasingly require workers with specific technical skills, which many displaced workers do not have.”

*Time:* 2025-11-29T12:14:28.677Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that sentence is clear, specific, and fits the paragraph’s argument. Well done.

Quick, focused feedback
- Strengths: It gives a concrete example (firms require specific skills) and links directly to your topic sentence (displaced workers can’t move into new jobs). This strengthens your paragraph’s logic.
- Tiny suggestion (optional): you can make it slightly more concise by using “lack” instead of “do not have” (e.g., “…which many displaced workers lack.”) — but your sentence is fine as written.

Because you changed that sentence, here is the full essay with your sentence inserted (no other edits):

Next step — pick one short sentence to revise
I recommend we work next on this sentence:  
"In this world, there are too many people didn't have a chance of education, so they find jobs more difficultly."

Would you like to:
A) Try rewriting that single sentence now? (recommended), or  
B) Ask for one very short grammar hint first?

If you choose A, try one of these short frames (use your own words; just one sentence):
- Frame 1 (concise): "Many people have not had access to education, so they struggle to find work."
- Frame 2 (cause → effect): "Because many people lack access to education, they cannot acquire the skills needed for available jobs."
- Frame 3 (formal): "Large numbers of people lack educational opportunities, which makes it difficult for them to secure employment."

If you choose B, here are two micro-hints to apply:
- Use “have not had” or “lack” instead of “didn't have” in this context.
- Use “struggle to find work” or “find jobs difficult” instead of “find jobs more difficultly” (adverb form is wrong here).

Which do you prefer — try the rewrite now (paste one sentence) or ask a short hint?

*Time:* 2025-11-29T12:14:49.272Z

**You:** “Because many people lack access to education, they cannot acquire the skills needed for available jobs.”

*Time:* 2025-11-29T12:16:18.078Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that sentence is clear, concise, and fits the paragraph’s logic. Well done!

Small suggestion (optional): you could replace “available jobs” with “new jobs” or “emerging jobs” if you want to emphasize that the jobs created by automation are different from those lost. But your sentence is strong as written.

I’ve inserted your sentence into the full essay below (no other changes). Read it and then choose the next step I suggest after the text.

Next suggested step (your action)
The paragraph’s final sentence still needs work — it currently says, “Thus, global employment would enhance because of automation,” which contradicts your thesis and the paragraph’s argument. Please try rewriting that single concluding sentence for the paragraph so it clearly matches your thesis (that automation will worsen employment prospects) and sums up the paragraph’s point about skill gaps.

Try one short sentence only. Here are two simple frames you can adapt (or write your own):
- Frame A: “Therefore, automation will ___ because ___.”  
- Frame B: “Thus, without ___, automation will ___.”

Would you like to try rewriting that concluding sentence now? Paste only your revised sentence and I’ll give quick, focused feedback.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T12:16:37.203Z

**You:** Therefore, automation will worsen employment prospects because there will be a large number of low-skilled workers.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T12:22:09.456Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that sentence clearly matches your paragraph’s logic and your thesis. Quick, focused feedback:

- Strength: It directly states the paragraph’s conclusion and connects to your thesis (automation will worsen employment prospects).
- Tiny wording suggestions you can apply if you want a stronger academic tone:
  - Make the causal link more explicit (e.g., explain who will be low-skilled: “many displaced workers will remain low-skilled and unable to transition”).
  - Consider “large numbers of” instead of “a large number of” for smoother flow, or add “unable to find new work” to clarify the consequence.
- Do you want to tweak it now? If yes, try one short revision and I’ll give focused feedback. If you’re happy, we can move to the next paragraph or do sentence-level grammar checks.

Which would you like to do next?
- A: Make one small revision to your new concluding sentence now (I’ll give focused feedback), or  
- B: Move on to revising the third body paragraph (topic sentence + supporting sentences), or  
- C: Work on sentence-level grammar and punctuation across the whole essay.

Pick A, B, or C and we’ll continue step by step.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T12:22:28.820Z

**You:** Move on to revise the conclusion

*Time:* 2025-11-29T12:23:16.898Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for saying you want to revise the conclusion. Two quick things before we start:

1) Scope check (quick)
- Our agreed scope was to revise the thesis, one body paragraph’s topic sentence, and that paragraph’s content. Revising the conclusion expands that scope. Do you want to expand now so I can help with the conclusion too? (yes / no)

2) If yes, confirm priorities for the conclusion
- Do you want to focus on:
  A) Structure: a clear restatement of your thesis + summary of main points? (yes / no)
  B) Grammar and phrasing (sentence-level corrections and academic tone)? (yes / no)
(You can pick both. Tell me which to prioritise.)

If you want to continue, here’s a very short diagnostic of your current concluding material and a simple, guided plan.

Quick diagnosis of your current conclusion (one-sentence summary)
- Strength: You try to restate the negative effect of automation on employees.
- Main problems: unclear grammar and phrasing, contradictory wording in places, and a weak concluding structure (doesn’t clearly restate the thesis, summarize reasons, or give a final insight).

What a strong conclusion should do (3 quick moves)
1. Restate your thesis in different words (confident, direct).
2. Summarize the main reasons you gave (1–2 short phrases).
3. Close with a final implication or recommendation (e.g., need for retraining, policy attention, or an uncertain future).

Helpful sentence frames — try one of these to write your own (please try it yourself first)
- Two-sentence conclusion (compact):
  1) “In conclusion, [restate thesis in fresh words].”
  2) “Because [reason 1] and [reason 2], policymakers and employers should [suggestion/implication].”

- One-sentence conclusion (if you prefer shorter):
  “In short, [restate thesis + brief reasons], so urgent action on training and education is needed to reduce the harm to workers.”

Micro-hints for your language
- Avoid: “it should be concerned” / “it affect their opportunties” / “would enhance because” — these are unclear or grammatically wrong.
- Prefer: “is a serious concern,” “affects their opportunities,” “will worsen employment prospects,” “policymakers should,” “investment in retraining is necessary.”
- Keep verbs consistent (if thesis uses “will,” use similar firmness in the conclusion).

Your turn (please try this first)
- Write one or two sentences for the conclusion using one of the frames above and paste them here.
- I’ll give quick, focused feedback and then, if you’re happy, I’ll insert the revised conclusion into the full essay and show the full revised text.

If you’d rather I show one model revision first, tell me “Show model,” and I’ll provide a single suggested conclusion sentence — but I’d prefer you try it first so you practice. Which do you choose? (I’ll wait for your rewrite.)

*Time:* 2025-11-29T12:23:31.179Z

**You:** In short, automation will affect global employment because many workers will be replaced and they can’t find jobs easily, so urgent action on training and education is needed to reduce the harm to workers.

*Time:* 2025-11-29T12:29:10.945Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — that conclusion sentence is clear, concise, and it ties the essay’s argument to a concrete implication (action on training and education). Well done.

Quick, focused feedback (tiny, actionable points)
- Strong: it restates the essay’s main idea and gives a policy implication — exactly what a good conclusion should do.
- Two small wording suggestions you can consider:
  - Use more academic phrasing to match your thesis: “worsen global employment prospects” (instead of “affect global employment”).
  - Replace informal “can’t find jobs easily” with “struggle to find new employment” or “are unable to secure alternative employment.”
- Optional style: splitting into two short sentences can increase clarity (one to restate the claim, one to give the implication).

Would you like to
A) Keep your sentence exactly as is (I’ll accept it and we’ll move on), or  
B) Try a small revision now (you can pick one of the tiny wording changes above and paste your new version), or  
C) Ask me to show one suggested revision for you to consider?

Because you gave a specific edit, I’ve inserted your conclusion sentence into the full essay below (I replaced the earlier closing sentences with your sentence). Read it and tell me whether you want to keep it or revise it slightly. If you want a small rewrite, try your own first — I’ll help polish it.

**You:** I think you can show the final version of essay

*Time:* 2025-11-29T12:30:52.067Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — here is the final revised version of your essay. I fixed grammar, vocabulary, clarity, and coherence while keeping your original ideas and the thesis you chose.

Nowadays, automation is increasingly common, especially in industry. It can improve production efficiency and reduce costs, but many people fear that it will lead to job losses and higher unemployment. While automation may boost industrial productivity in the short term, it will ultimately worsen global employment prospects because it directly replaces workers and creates a skills mismatch.

Automation can enhance productivity and cost efficiency, but it will replace many manufacturing workers. For example, automated systems allow firms to produce more goods with fewer staff, and they lower labour and equipment costs. As a result, the number of employees in certain sectors will decline over time. As technology advances, demand for routine workers will fall, causing widespread job losses. Therefore, automation will worsen employment prospects for large groups of low‑skilled workers.

Moreover, many displaced workers are unable to move into the new jobs that automation creates because they lack the necessary skills and training. Many workers do not have access to retraining programmes, so they struggle to find alternative employment in other sectors. For example, firms increasingly require specific technical skills for emerging roles, which many displaced workers do not possess. Because many people lack educational opportunities, they cannot acquire the skills needed for available jobs, and so they are left at a disadvantage.

In short, automation will negatively affect global employment because it both replaces workers and leaves many unable to secure new roles. To reduce this harm, policymakers and employers should invest in education and retraining programmes so that displaced workers can acquire the skills required for emerging jobs.

Would you like me to do a final copy‑edit for punctuation and any remaining small grammar issues, or to help you expand this into a longer essay with more examples and citations?
