            ## Contribution Analysis

            Your revised short-term displacement paragraph is strong and clear. The evidence is concrete, the cause-effect explanations are logical, and the policy implication ties well back to your thesis. The small edits I suggested mainly ensure clarity, conciseness, and cautious qualification of the statistic.

If you’re happy with my suggested version, here’s the final text you can use for that paragraph:

> In the short term, automation displaces repetitive jobs, disproportionately impacting low-skilled workers in manufacturing and basic administrative roles. For example, in some manufacturing hubs robots now handle about 30% of routine production tasks (from assembly-line work to inventory tracking) that were previously performed by humans. Because these roles require little specialized training, displaced workers often struggle to find equivalent employment without reskilling, frequently moving into informal, low-paid work that offers less income and security. This immediate displacement underscores the need for targeted policy interventions to ease transitions for vulnerable workers. If left unaddressed, these hardships could widen inequality even as automation generates long-term economic gains.

Would you like to:  
- (a) accept this as the polished final version of the paragraph, or  
- (b) tweak any part further (e.g., adding a source or changing the geographic claim about the 30% stat), or  
- (c) move on to revise another paragraph (such as the historical precedent / new job creation paragraph)?

Let me know how you’d like to proceed!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The original draft presented a clear stance that automation will transform rather than destroy employment and used relevant examples (e.g., new AI-related roles). Some claims lacked development or sourcing (e.g., “robots now handle 30% of production work” appears without qualification).
- Organization: 21/25 - Logical overall sequence (short-term effects → history → long-term effects → policy). Paragraph topic sentences were present but sometimes diffuse, causing some paragraphs to try to do two jobs.
- Vocabulary: 21/25 - Appropriate academic tone and varied word choice; used topic-specific terms (automation, digitalization). Occasional hedging and awkward phrasing reduced precision.
- Grammar: 21/25 - Generally accurate sentence structure and grammar; a few long sentences that could be tightened and one punctuation omission at the end of the draft.

- **Original Essay Total: 84/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 24/25 - Thesis was tightened to preview three clear points: short-term displacement, new tech-driven jobs, and policy needs. The short-term paragraph now links evidence to consequences effectively. The essay could be improved by adding explicit sourcing and deeper development in later paragraphs.
- Organization: 24/25 - Thesis now maps cleanly to body paragraphs. Topic sentence for the short-term paragraph is concise and the paragraph was reorganized to separate claim, evidence, explanation, and implication—improving paragraph unity and logical progression.
- Vocabulary: 23/25 - Improved concision and clarity (e.g., “technology-driven jobs,” “targeted policy interventions”). A few phrases could still be tightened; overall vocabulary is precise and appropriate.
- Grammar: 24/25 - Sentence-level edits reduced run-ons and improved clarity. Punctuation and phrasing in the revised paragraph are stronger. Minor stylistic tweaks remain possible.

- **Revised Essay Total: 95/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +11 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis revised to a concise, previewing statement: “Automation will transform global employment by displacing repetitive labor in the short term, creating new technology-driven jobs, and requiring policy interventions to ensure an equitable transition.”
  - Topic sentence refined for the short-term paragraph: “In the short term, automation displaces repetitive jobs, disproportionately impacting low-skilled workers in manufacturing and basic administrative roles.”
  - Short-term displacement paragraph reorganized: evidence (30% stat) moved into a supporting sentence, causal explanation added, and a clear link back to policy needs established.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The 30% statistic should be sourced or more explicitly qualified (e.g., cite a study or specify which hubs) to strengthen credibility.
  - Other paragraphs (historical precedent, economic growth, critics/policy) would benefit from similarly explicit evidence-explanation links and possible expansion of counterarguments.
  - Conclusion could better synthesize reasons rather than merely restating the position; integrate the three previewed points more explicitly in the final synthesis.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 13 messages** (assistant and student turns combined).
- **Conversation Quality:** Focused, structured, and iterative. The assistant laid out a clear three-step revision plan; the student selected goals, produced revised thesis and topic sentence, and drafted a revised paragraph. Dialogue included diagnostic feedback, suggested revisions, and back-and-forth iteration.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 4/5 - The chat shows a robust stepwise revision process with clear goals and multiple focused turns. It is not extremely long (not the 15–25+ exchanges described for a 5) but the exchanges were high-quality and targeted.
  - Evidence: The assistant outlined a three-step plan and the student followed through on each step, producing a revised thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 4/5 - The student evaluated and selectively adopted the assistant’s suggestions (adopted the tightened thesis form, revised the topic sentence following guidance, and rewrote the paragraph while incorporating but not blindly copying the assistant’s language).
  - Evidence: Student wrote “I’ll adopt the tightened version… Automation will transform…” and produced their own topic sentence: “In the short term, automation displaces repetitive jobs, disproportionately impacting low-skilled workers…”
- **Refining Process**: 4/5 - Clear iterative process: diagnosis → thesis revision → topic sentence revision → paragraph revision. Multiple cycles of feedback and revision occurred, though only one paragraph was fully revised in this exchange.
  - Evidence: Assistant provided a scaffold; student produced a revised paragraph; assistant suggested concise edits and provided a model revision.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 12/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear goal-setting and alignment: Student confirmed the prompt (automation) and selected paragraph-structure as the focus. Evidence: “Intended Prompt: Automation… Chosen Body Paragraph to Revise: Short-term displacement…”
- Effective use of AI scaffolding: Student followed the assistant’s three-step plan and produced a tightened thesis and topic sentence that mapped to body paragraphs.
- Improved paragraph unity and evidence linkage: The revised short-term paragraph separates claim, evidence, explanation, and implication, e.g., “Because these roles require little specialized training, displaced workers often struggle to secure equivalent employment… This immediate displacement underscores the need for targeted policy interventions…”

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Cite and qualify statistics: Add sources or clearer qualifiers for the “30%” statistic (e.g., study, region, year).
- Extend revision pattern across the essay: Apply the same evidence-explanation-implication scaffold to the remaining paragraphs (historical precedent, economic growth, critics/policy) for a uniformly strong argument.
- Strengthen conclusion synthesis: Bring together the three previewed points more explicitly rather than restating the thesis; show how policy, job creation, and short-term displacement interact.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - Student clarified which prompt they were answering and provided the draft text; this allowed targeted help. Evidence: “Intended Prompt: Automation (my draft focuses on automation’s impact on employment…).”
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - Student selected a specific, measurable target (paragraph structure) and followed a staged plan suggested by the assistant.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Good - Student selectively accepted and adapted AI suggestions (tightened thesis, revised topic sentence) and made independent choices.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - Student produced revised sentences and a revised paragraph rather than relying solely on the assistant’s rewrites.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Add explicit sourcing and qualifiers for statistics and claims (e.g., “According to [source], in [year] robots accounted for ~30% of routine tasks in X region”) to strengthen credibility.
2. Apply the same revision scaffold (claim → evidence → explanation → implication) to the remaining body paragraphs and tighten the conclusion into a synthesis of the three previewed points.
3. Expand the counterargument section with more specific examples and rebuttals (e.g., timelines for reskilling programs, empirical studies of employment shifts) to deepen analysis.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student completed all three requested revision tasks (thesis, topic sentence, and one body paragraph) and demonstrated thoughtful engagement with AI guidance. They showed good independent editing and critical selection of suggestions.
- Encourage the student to provide citations for key statistics and to replicate the clear paragraph-structure approach across the entire essay. This will raise the essay from a strong draft to a more academically robust paper suitable for submission.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Automation, a defining technological shift of the modern era, is reshaping industries by cutting costs and boosting efficiency—but its long-term impact on global employment remains fiercely debated. While some argue it will ultimately strengthen job prospects, others fear it will erode livelihoods.
In the short term, automation clearly displaces certain roles: repetitive jobs (e.g., factory assembly lines, basic administrative tasks) are most at risk, as seen in manufacturing hubs where robots now handle 30% of production work. This creates immediate hardship, especially for low-skilled workers in emerging economies. However, history shows that technological revolutions (e.g., the Industrial Revolution, digitalization) often create new jobs alongside eliminating old ones. Automation, for example, has spawned roles in AI programming, robot maintenance, and data analysis—fields that did not exist a decade ago.
Moreover, automation drives economic growth by making industries more competitive. Efficient, automated sectors attract investment, expand production, and create indirect jobs in support services (e.g., logistics, marketing for tech firms). In the long term, this growth can lift overall employment levels, even as job types evolve.
Critics counter that the transition may be too rapid for workers to reskill, widening inequality. Yet with proactive policies (e.g., government-funded training programs, universal basic income trials), societies can mitigate harm while harnessing automation’s benefits.
In conclusion, automation will not “undermine” global employment long-term—but it will transform it. The key is ensuring the gains are shared through strategic, inclusive policies

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:31:11.957Z

**You:** can I have a feedback on aspects like the paragraph structure?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:38:02.444Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m happy to help. Before I give feedback on paragraph structure, let’s do a quick negotiating-and-diagnosis step so we can focus the revision session where it will help you most.

1) Quick goal check
- What do you most want to improve in this draft right now? (Choose any you want to work on today: clarity, argument strength, paragraph structure, thesis alignment, evidence/analysis, grammar/style.)
- Or tell me in one sentence your personal goal for this session.

2) Brief diagnostic feedback (using rubric categories)
I read your draft. Here’s a short diagnostic that highlights strengths and the main areas to work on.

- Thesis & Argument
  - Strengths: You take a clear stance that automation will transform rather than destroy employment and you suggest policy is needed to share benefits.
  - Needs work: The thesis is a bit general and doesn’t clearly preview the main reasons/points you’ll discuss. Also — important — your course prompt at the top (about migrant workers and government regulation) does not match this essay topic (automation). Decide which prompt you are answering. If your assignment is the migrant-worker question, this draft is off-topic.

- Organization (paragraph structure & flow)
  - Strengths: Logical sequence: short-term impact, historical precedent, long-term economic effects, policy response. Transitions between paragraphs are generally smooth.
  - Needs work: Some paragraphs attempt to do two jobs (e.g., combining evidence and a big claim in one long paragraph). Topic sentences could be clearer in linking each paragraph to the central claim. Consider splitting one paragraph into two where you move from describing a fact to analyzing its implications. Also the conclusion restates your view but doesn’t synthesize the main reasons you gave.

- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: You include concrete examples (30% production by robots; new job types) which strengthen credibility.
  - Needs work: Evidence needs clearer sourcing/qualification (e.g., where does “30%” come from?). Some claims would benefit from more explanation about how evidence supports the claim — right now you sometimes jump from fact to conclusion without the analytic step.

- Language Use (clarity, style, grammar)
  - Strengths: Generally clear, varied sentence structures, appropriate academic tone.
  - Needs work: Avoid hedging and quotation marks around single words (e.g., “undermine”) that weaken the claim. A few sentences are long and could be broken for clarity. Check punctuation at the end (final sentence currently missing a period).

3) Choosing priorities for this session
What would you like to focus on in our three-step revision process? (Pick up to two.)
Options I recommend, based on the diagnosis:
- Fixing alignment with the assignment prompt (critical if you’re supposed to write about migrant workers)
- Making the thesis clearer and more specific (so it previews the main points)
- Strengthening topic sentences and paragraph structure (so each paragraph ties clearly to thesis)
- Improving evidence explanation (linking facts to claims)

Which of these would you like to work on now? Confirm your choice and then we’ll start Step 1 (thesis revision).

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:38:14.305Z

**You:** I want to improve the paragraph structure.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:39:37.667Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks. I’m glad you picked paragraph structure. A couple quick checks before we start Step 1.

1) Quick confirmations
- You chose to focus on paragraph structure — confirmed. 
- One important issue: the course prompt you showed at the top asks about migrant workers and government regulation, but your draft is about automation. Which prompt are you actually answering for this assignment: the migrant-worker question or the automation question? We should fix that now if it’s off-target.

2) Please paste your intended thesis sentence (or tell me which sentence in your draft is the thesis)
(If you’re not sure, tell me which line you mean — e.g., the final sentence of the introduction, or the sentence in your conclusion that states your view.)

3) Quick, focused feedback on the thesis (based on what I see now)
- Strengths: You have a clear position — automation will transform but not destroy employment — and you signal policy matters.
- Main weaknesses to fix for paragraph-structure work: the thesis is too general and doesn’t preview the main reasons you’ll develop across paragraphs. Because we’re focusing on structure, the thesis needs to clearly map to the main topic sentences so each paragraph has a clear job in supporting it.

Hints for revising the thesis (use these to guide your rewrite — try writing it yourself)
- Make the claim confident and direct (no hedging or scare quotes).
- Include 2–3 preview points that match your body paragraphs (for example: short-term displacement, new job creation/skill shifts, and the need for policy to share benefits/reskill workers).
- Keep it concise so each paragraph can directly link back to one previewed point.

Would you like to try revising the thesis now? Paste your new sentence when you’re ready.

4) Choose the body paragraph to focus on next (Step 2 and Step 3)
Which paragraph do you want to work on today for paragraph-structure revision? Choose one:
- Short-term displacement (the paragraph about repetitive jobs / 30% robots)
- Historical precedent / new job creation (Industrial Revolution → new roles)
- Economic growth / indirect jobs (investment, support services)
- Critics & policy response (reskilling, UBI, mitigation)

Confirm: your chosen prompt (automation or migrant workers), paste your thesis, and tell me which paragraph you want to work on. Then we’ll move into Step 1.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:39:51.996Z

**You:** Intended Prompt: Automation (my draft focuses on automation’s impact on employment, so I’m answering the automation question — apologies for the initial prompt mix-up!).
Revised Thesis Statement: Automation will transform global employment by causing short-term displacement of repetitive labor, creating new jobs tied to technological advancement, and requiring policy interventions to ensure equitable transitions, but it will not eliminate overall employment.
Chosen Body Paragraph to Revise: Short-term displacement (the paragraph about repetitive jobs / 30% robots)
This thesis now previews three core points (short-term displacement, new job creation, policy needs) that align with potential body paragraphs, and it’s direct (no hedging) while staying concise. I’d like to start refining the short-term displacement paragraph first to ensure its topic sentence and structure directly support the first previewed point....

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:44:13.103Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for the clear choices. Quick recap and next steps before we begin:

- Confirmed prompt: automation (good).
- Confirmed target for this session: paragraph structure (you want to focus on the short-term displacement paragraph).
- Thesis you posted: “Automation will transform global employment by causing short-term displacement of repetitive labor, creating new jobs tied to technological advancement, and requiring policy interventions to ensure equitable transitions, but it will not eliminate overall employment.” — good: it previews three points and is direct.

Step 1 — Quick feedback on your thesis
- Strengths: Clear position; previews three main points that map well to body paragraphs; confident tone.
- Small improvements to consider:
  - Remove the trailing “but it will not eliminate overall employment” as a separate clause — it slightly weakens rhythm. You could integrate it more smoothly or leave it out and let body paragraphs show the point.
  - Tighten wording (shorter, crisper phrasing helps topic sentences connect clearly).
- Optional tightened version you can adopt or adapt (use only if you want it): Automation will transform global employment by displacing repetitive labor in the short term, creating new technology-driven jobs, and requiring policy interventions to ensure an equitable transition.

Would you like to keep your current thesis as-is, adopt the tightened version above, or try a quick tweak yourself now? Tell me which and paste your final thesis if you change it. We’ll confirm it before moving on.

Step 2 — Topic sentence for the short-term displacement paragraph
- Please paste the current topic sentence you want to revise (the one from that paragraph). If you prefer, you can try rewriting it now and paste your new version.
- Quick diagnostic on the paragraph’s current opening (from your draft): “In the short term, automation clearly displaces certain roles: repetitive jobs (e.g., factory assembly lines, basic administrative tasks) are most at risk, as seen in manufacturing hubs where robots now handle 30% of production work.”
  - What’s good: It states the short-term effect and gives a concrete example (30%).
  - What to fix for stronger structure:
    - Make the main claim concise and direct (drop words like “clearly”).
    - Put one main idea in the topic sentence (the claim), and move the example/statistic into the next sentence as supporting evidence.
    - Connect the claim to consequences (e.g., who is harmed — low-skilled workers, especially in emerging economies) so the paragraph has a clear analytic focus.

Hints to guide your rewrite (try one short sentence):
- Start with the claim: “In the short term, automation displaces repetitive jobs…”
- Add the consequence or affected group: “…displacing repetitive jobs and harming low-skilled workers in emerging economies.”
- Keep the statistic or example in the sentence that follows, not in the topic sentence, unless you make the topic sentence short.

If you’d like, here are two brief model-topic-sentence options you can adapt (you don’t have to copy them exactly):
- Option A: Automation displaces repetitive jobs in the short term, disproportionately affecting low‑skilled workers.
- Option B: In the short term, automation reduces demand for routine tasks, creating immediate hardship for workers in manufacturing and basic administrative roles.

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now? Paste your new topic sentence when you’re ready. Once you’re happy with it, we’ll move to Step 3 and revise the rest of that paragraph (supporting sentences and evidence) together.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:44:28.909Z

**You:** Thanks for your information. I’ll adopt the tightened version — it’s crisper and better aligned with paragraph structure: “Automation will transform global employment by displacing repetitive labor in the short term, creating new technology-driven jobs, and requiring policy interventions to ensure an equitable transition.”
Drawing from your hints, I’ve refined it to be concise, claim-focused, and connected to consequences: “In the short term, automation displaces repetitive jobs, disproportionately impacting low-skilled workers in manufacturing and basic administrative roles.”
This topic sentence hones in on the core claim (displacement of repetitive work) and the key affected group — keeping it tight so the rest of the paragraph can dive into evidence (like the 30% robot statistic) to support it.im ready to move to Step 3 and polish the supporting sentences!

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:46:54.447Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — your thesis and topic sentence are much clearer and much easier to map onto paragraph structure. I’ll insert those changes into your draft so you can see how they fit, then we’ll move into polishing the supporting sentences together.

First: here’s the full essay with your revised thesis as the third sentence of the introduction and your new topic sentence for the short-term paragraph. I’ve made one minimal move so the statistic remains present (I moved the 30% example into the sentence after the topic sentence). I did not otherwise rewrite the paragraph so you can keep control of the wording.

Automation, a defining technological shift of the modern era, is reshaping industries by cutting costs and boosting efficiency—but its long-term impact on global employment remains fiercely debated. While some argue it will ultimately strengthen job prospects, others fear it will erode livelihoods. Automation will transform global employment by displacing repetitive labor in the short term, creating new technology-driven jobs, and requiring policy interventions to ensure an equitable transition.

In the short term, automation displaces repetitive jobs, disproportionately impacting low-skilled workers in manufacturing and basic administrative roles. For example, in some manufacturing hubs robots now handle 30% of production work. This creates immediate hardship, especially for low-skilled workers in emerging economies. However, history shows that technological revolutions (e.g., the Industrial Revolution, digitalization) often create new jobs alongside eliminating old ones. Automation, for example, has spawned roles in AI programming, robot maintenance, and data analysis—fields that did not exist a decade ago.

Moreover, automation drives economic growth by making industries more competitive. Efficient, automated sectors attract investment, expand production, and create indirect jobs in support services (e.g., logistics, marketing for tech firms). In the long term, this growth can lift overall employment levels, even as job types evolve.

Critics counter that the transition may be too rapid for workers to reskill, widening inequality. Yet with proactive policies (e.g., government-funded training programs, universal basic income trials), societies can mitigate harm while harnessing automation’s benefits.

In conclusion, automation will not undermine global employment long term—but it will transform it. The key is ensuring the gains are shared through strategic, inclusive policies.

Step 3 — Polishing the supporting sentences (interactive)
Would you like to try revising the supporting sentences in that short-term paragraph now? I’ll guide you with targeted prompts and quick checks.

Here’s a simple scaffold you can use to rewrite those supporting sentences (try writing 2–3 sentences using this order):
1) Evidence/example (the 30% statistic — you can keep it or qualify it: “in some manufacturing hubs”).
2) Explanation: connect the evidence to the claim — how does the statistic cause hardship? Who exactly is affected and why?
3) Implication/transition: link this consequence to the rest of the essay (e.g., why this shows policy or reskilling is needed).

Try rewriting those 2–3 supporting sentences now and paste them here. If you’d like a little help first, here are two short, non-full-paragraph hints you can adapt (I won’t give a full replacement — just phrases you can fold into your own sentences):

- Phrase to explain cause-and-effect: “Because these tasks require little specialized training, displaced workers struggle to find equivalent employment without reskilling, pushing many into precarious, low-paid work.”
- Phrase to show broader consequence or link to thesis: “This immediate hardship highlights the need for targeted policy measures to support worker transitions.”

Would you like to try a first draft of those supporting sentences? Paste them and I’ll give focused feedback (clarity, unity, evidence linkage), then we’ll finalize that paragraph together.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:47:20.641Z

**You:** Got it.
In the short term, automation displaces repetitive jobs, disproportionately impacting low-skilled workers in manufacturing and basic administrative roles. For example, in major manufacturing hubs across Asia and Latin America, robots now handle 30% of routine production tasks—from assembly line work to inventory tracking—that were once done by human labor. Because these roles require minimal specialized training, displaced workers often struggle to secure equivalent employment without reskilling, forcing many into informal or low-wage jobs that fail to sustain their previous livelihoods. This immediate displacement underscores why policy interventions (a core preview of the thesis) are critical to easing the transition for vulnerable workers, as unaddressed hardship could widen inequality even as automation drives long-term economic gains.
This version grounds the statistic in a specific geographic context (adding clarity), explains why the displacement harms workers (linking evidence to the topic sentence’s focus on low-skilled labor), and ties the consequence directly back to the thesis’s policy preview—keeping the paragraph unified and purposeful. Ready for your feedback to tweak further!

*Time:* 2025-11-30T09:51:07.400Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — this paragraph is already focused, evidence-backed, and clearly tied to your thesis. Quick, targeted feedback and a small suggested tightening below.

What’s working
- Good topic sentence that states the claim and identifies who’s affected.
- The 30% statistic is a useful concrete example.
- Strong causal explanation linking low training requirements to poor re-employment outcomes.
- You end by connecting the paragraph back to the thesis (policy is needed).

Suggested, focused edits
- Qualify or cite the 30% stat if you can (e.g., “in some manufacturing hubs” or a source) to avoid overgeneralizing.
- Remove the parenthetical “(a core preview of the thesis)” — it’s unnecessary. Let the sentence itself show the link.
- Break the final long sentence into two for clarity.
- Tighten a few phrases for concision (e.g., “were once done by human labor” → “were previously performed by humans”; “informal or low-wage jobs that fail to sustain their previous livelihoods” → “informal, low-paid work that offers less income and security”).

A brief suggested revision of those supporting sentences (you don’t have to copy this exactly — use it as a model):
- For example, in some manufacturing hubs robots now handle about 30% of routine production tasks (from assembly-line work to inventory tracking) that were previously performed by humans. Because these roles require little specialized training, displaced workers often struggle to find equivalent employment without reskilling, frequently moving into informal, low-paid work that offers less income and security. This immediate displacement underscores the need for targeted policy interventions to ease transitions for vulnerable workers. If left unaddressed, these hardships could widen inequality even as automation generates long-term economic gains.
