            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your essay and the detailed assessment. Based on the feedback and the final analysis, here are some concrete, actionable suggestions to help you continue improving your essay and interaction with AI in future writing tasks:

---

### Suggestions for Essay Improvement

1. **Add Concrete Evidence and Examples**  
   To strengthen your argument about automation harming jobs, add specific facts or examples. For instance:  
   - Mention industries affected by AI, like manufacturing, customer service, or transportation.  
   - Cite studies or statistics from credible sources (e.g., reports by the World Economic Forum or OECD) showing how many jobs might be displaced or how automation has shifted labor markets.  
   - Use brief, illustrative examples such as “AI-powered chatbots have replaced many customer support roles in banks and telecom companies.”

2. **Clarify and Refine Your Second Reason**  
   Replace vague or hyperbolic expressions like “lose their rationality” or “too lazy to work and study.” Instead, consider:  
   - Discuss “risk of deskilling,” where overreliance on technology reduces practice of certain skills.  
   - Explain how automation might affect motivation to develop certain competencies or how it could change workforce adaptability and creativity.  
   - For example: “Increased dependence on AI tools may lead to reduced development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills among workers, potentially diminishing their future employability.”

3. **Ensure Clear Alignment with the Assignment Prompt**  
   Confirm the essay topic requested by your instructor. If the original prompt was about climate change or another issue, adjust your essay accordingly or seek clarification. Staying aligned helps maintain focus and relevance.

4. **Strengthen Vocabulary and Formal Tone**
   - Use precise academic phrases and avoid colloquial language. For example, instead of “AI got a lots of big data,” say “AI processes large volumes of complex data efficiently.”  
   - Replace awkward phrases with natural expressions — e.g., change “data aggregation speed” to “data processing speed.”  
   - Avoid repetition by using synonyms and varying sentence structures.

5. **Improve Transitions and Logical Flow**  
   - Make clear connections between points with appropriate linking words (e.g., “Moreover,” “Consequently,” “This leads to…”).  
   - Within paragraphs, ensure each sentence develops the point introduced by the topic sentence without jumping to unrelated ideas.

### Tips for Enhancing AI Collaboration Skills

1. **Engage in Iterative Revision**  
   - Share your drafts in stages with the AI. For example, post your thesis revision first, then ask for feedback before moving to paragraph revisions.  
   - Respond to AI feedback explicitly: say what you agree or disagree with and why. This shows reflective thinking.

2. **Ask Targeted Questions**  
   Prompt the AI with specific requests, such as:  
   - “Is my new topic sentence clear and focused?”  
   - “Can you suggest examples to support this paragraph?”  
   - “How can I make this sentence more formal and academic?”

3. **Document Your Revision Process**  
   Keep a chat record of your interactions with AI that captures:  
   - Your original text, AI suggestions, and your revised version.  
   - Brief notes on why you accepted or rejected certain feedback.  
   This not only improves transparency but helps instructors assess your engagement and learning.

4. **Clarify Context and Goals Early**  
   When starting AI-assisted writing, share assignment details (prompt, audience, word count) and your revision goals to get better-tailored support.

### Summary

You have demonstrated a strong ability to revise content, organization, grammar, and vocabulary independently, which is excellent progress! To take your writing and AI collaboration to the next level:

- Add specific, credible evidence and clear examples to support your argument.  
- Replace vague expressions with precise, academic language, especially in complex claims.  
- Stay aligned with the assignment prompt to ensure relevance.  
- Use the AI iteratively by posting drafts and discussing suggested changes explicitly.  

By applying these strategies, your essays will become more persuasive and polished, and your interaction with AI will be richer and more productive.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 15/25 - The essay presents a clear central claim (automation/AI harms employment) but develops it with limited precision and weak support. Ideas are repetitively stated and lack concrete evidence or examples. Example: "we all that Automation is transforming our world ... potentially reducing jobs" is understandable but underdeveloped.
- Organization: 15/25 - There is a basic paragraph structure (intro + two reasons) but transitions and logical clarity are weak; sentences jump between points and some ideas are repeated rather than sequenced logically.
- Vocabulary: 14/25 - Vocabulary is simple and sometimes inaccurate ("lose their mind", "AI got a lots of big data"). Word choice issues reduce clarity.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Frequent grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors (e.g., missing spaces after commas, tense/number errors: "AI got a lots of big data", "some jobs ... are no longer need human"). Errors sometimes impede comprehension.
- **Original Essay Total: 58/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The thesis is clearer: "I believe that in the long run, it will harm global employment prospects, mainly for two reasons." The two reasons are stated and explained. However, claims are still largely general and would benefit from specific evidence or examples (statistics, studies, or concrete industry examples).
- Organization: 21/25 - Paragraphing and logical progression improved: clear intro, two distinct body paragraphs each introduced by a topic sentence, and a concluding sentence in the paragraph. Flow between ideas is better, though the second paragraph's internal logic (linking automation to loss of "rationality") needs tightening.
- Vocabulary: 19/25 - Word choice is improved and more formal ("advanced technologies", "data aggregation"). Some awkward or imprecise phrasing remains ("lose their rationality", "database construction and data aggregation speed"); refining idiomatic expressions and precision would raise this score.
- Grammar: 19/25 - Many surface errors corrected (sentence boundaries, punctuation). Sentence structures are more varied and clearer. A few awkward constructions and slight clarity issues persist.
- **Revised Essay Total: 79/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +21 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis clarified and restated in a concise, argumentative form: "I believe that in the long run, it will harm global employment prospects..."
  - Topic sentences and paragraph structure strengthened: e.g., "First, advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) may replace human jobs globally."
  - Grammar, punctuation, and formal vocabulary significantly improved, yielding clearer sentences and better flow.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Alignment with assignment prompt: the chat assistant asked whether the student meant to write on automation vs. a climate-change prompt; the essay still discusses automation rather than the possible intended prompt (climate change). The student should confirm prompt alignment.
  - Provide concrete evidence or examples (statistics, industry cases, citations) to substantiate claims about job loss and societal effects.
  - Revise or clarify the second reason: avoid vague or hyperbolic claims like "lose their rationality" or "too lazy to lazy to work and study" — instead argue how skills, motivation, or human competitiveness might change with clear mechanisms and evidence.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 3**
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided a clear coaching plan and stepwise process (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), demonstrating good scaffolding. The student asked a single open question ("How can I improve the essay") but did not proceed through the planned revision steps in the chat. There is no chat evidence of iterative revisions or substantive back-and-forth edits.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 - The chat consists of three messages: a detailed assistant plan, a short student prompt, and a clarifying assistant response. The exchange is helpful but sparse and lacks extended back-and-forth refinement.
  - Evidence: Initial assistant message outlines a three-step revision process. User only replied once ("How can I improve the essay") and did not continue the iterative exchange.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 - There is no evidence the student critically reviewed or rejected AI suggestions in the chat. The student did not record evaluations of proposed changes or rationale for accepting/rejecting suggestions.
  - Evidence: No messages in chat where the student comments on specific AI suggestions or explains choices.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 - The chat does not show multiple revision cycles or detailed edits based on AI feedback. Although a revised essay exists, the chat history does not document an iterative refining process with the AI.
  - Evidence: The assistant asked diagnostic questions and proposed steps; the student did not follow up in the chat to show the planned stepwise revisions.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 4/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear identification and articulation of a thesis in the revised essay: "I believe that in the long run, it will harm global employment prospects..." — shows capacity to state a position concisely.
- Improved organization and paragraphing with distinct topic sentences that map to the thesis (e.g., first topic sentence on AI replacing jobs).
- Substantive self-editing or external revision occurred (revised text shows better grammar and vocabulary than the original), indicating the student can apply editing skills.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Provide concrete evidence and examples to support claims (e.g., industries affected, studies on automation and employment trends).
- Improve precision and tone in claims (replace "lose their rationality" with a more precise claim such as "risk deskilling" or "decline in certain cognitive/technical skills without active practice").
- Increase engagement with AI during the revision process: document iterative drafts, respond to AI suggestions with reasons for acceptance or rejection, and ask more targeted questions.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Needs Improvement - The student did not clarify the assignment prompt in chat (assistant asked whether the essay topic matched a climate-change prompt), and the chat lacks contextual details (audience, assignment constraints).
- Strategic Planning: Good - The assistant provided a clear plan and the student appears to have followed some steps (thesis and paragraph revision), but the planning was not documented in chat.
- Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement - The chat contains no evidence the student critically evaluated AI suggestions; the student did not discuss why specific changes were chosen.
- Independent Editing: Good - The revised essay demonstrates independent editing ability (improved grammar, clearer thesis), though the process is not shown in the chat.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Add concrete evidence: include statistics, examples, or a brief citation to support claims about job displacement or social effects of automation.
2. Refine argument language: replace vague expressions ("lose their rationality") with precise academic terms (deskilling, reduced critical thinking practice, erosion of certain professional competencies).
3. Engage the AI iteratively in the chat: post draft changes, ask for specific feedback (e.g., “Is this topic sentence strong? Why/why not?”), and document acceptance/rejection of suggestions with brief rationales to strengthen collaboration skills.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student clearly revised the essay outside the visible chat (revised draft present), but the chat history does not document the revision process. For assessment of AI collaboration skills, encourage students to keep the full interactive chat record showing each revision cycle and explicit decisions.
- The assistant correctly identified a possible prompt mismatch (automation vs. climate change). Instructor should confirm the assignment topic and advise the student to ensure content alignment.
- Consider asking the student to add one more revision cycle focusing on evidence and rewording the second body paragraph to remove hyperbole and clarify the mechanism by which automation affects skills and motivation.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
By the trend of developing different new technology between countries,our life changed a lot.We all that Automation is transforming our world and our industries which potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency.By this phenomenon,people often  discuss about does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term.In my opinion,I think it undermine global employment prospects in the long term by two main reasons.
Firstly,advance technology such as AI could replace human work in global.By the reason of AI got a lots of big data,their data base and summarise speed is way more faster than human,some jobs for example language translator ,Accounting,Summarising documents and more different jobs are no longer need human to help,companies don’t need to employ several new workers for those easy jobs as AI could solve most of the work and buying one AI product or apps are way more cheaper than employ several workers in long term.
Secondly,by the automation trend,people will lose their mind because using technology which leds to the problem of their competitiveness will be way more lower than technology shift.As the reason that more younger people already being too lazy to lazy to work and study,most of them will choose to use AI rather than think by their own,this turns out the problem of people have less time to think by their brain in long term.

Revised:
With the development of new technologies in various countries, our lives have undergone tremendous changes. We all know that automation is transforming our world and all industries, increasing efficiency but potentially leading to fewer jobs. In light of this, people often discuss whether this technological change will ultimately benefit or harm global employment prospects in the long run. I believe that in the long run, it will harm global employment prospects, mainly for two reasons.

First, advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) may replace human jobs globally. Because AI possesses vast amounts of data, its database construction and data aggregation speed far surpasses that of humans. Therefore, some jobs, such as language translation, accounting, and document compilation, no longer require human intervention. Companies do not need to hire large numbers of new employees for these simple tasks, as AI can handle most of them. Moreover, the cost of purchasing AI products or applications is far lower than employing multiple people long-term.

Second, with the development of automation, people will gradually lose their rationality, because the decline in competitiveness brought by using technology far outweighs the challenges brought by technological transformation. As more and more young people become less inclined to work and study, most of them will choose to use AI instead of independent thinking. In the long run, this will result in a lack of time for independent thought.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

**You:** How can I improve the essay

*Time:* 2025-11-26T06:46:47.146Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s work together step by step. First, a few quick questions so we agree clear targets for this session.

1) What are your main goals right now? (Pick any: clarity, argument strength, staying on-topic, structure/organization, topic sentences, evidence/support, vocabulary, grammar/sentence structure, tone/formality.)

2) One important diagnostic question: Did you mean to write about automation and AI replacing jobs, or were you trying to answer the assigned prompt about individual actions vs governments/corporations on climate change? Your current draft discusses automation, which does not match the climate-change prompt.

Once you answer those two questions, I’ll:
- Give a short diagnostic using the rubric (content/ideas, organization, vocabulary, grammar).
- Ask you to pick which weaknesses you want to focus on (choose up to two — e.g., fix topic alignment + thesis; or thesis + one paragraph’s topic sentence and support).
- Then we’ll start Step 1 (thesis revision).

Quick note: I’ll guide you to rewrite the thesis and one paragraph; I’ll give feedback and examples but I’ll encourage you to try the rewrite first. Sound good?
