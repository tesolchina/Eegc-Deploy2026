            ## Contribution Analysis

            Certainly! Here is your body paragraph with all informal expressions underlined, along with suggested formal, academic alternatives:

---

**Your paragraph with informal expressions underlined:**

> By organizing, voting, and voicing their concerns, citizens can significantly influence how governments respond to climate challenges. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from **normal people** can have a **big effect**, even if individuals alone do not have much power. **But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.**

---

**Suggested formal/academic alternatives:**

- **normal people** → *ordinary citizens, the general public, members of society*  
- **big effect** → *significant impact, considerable influence, meaningful effect*  
- **But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well.** →  
  *However, governments may only respond minimally to public demands and fail to implement effective policies, resulting in limited progress.*  
- **Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.** →  
  *Additionally, communication barriers between citizens and policymakers can impede political responsiveness, leading to a lack of substantive change.*

If you like, you can now try revising your paragraph using these suggestions, starting with the sentences expressing government limitations and communication issues. Let me know if you want me to help with a draft revision!

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. Although individuals are not as powerful as governments or corporations, the importance of their actions should not be underestimated. Collective individual actions can influence government policy, and individual life style choice can impact company’s behavior.

By organizing, voting, and voicing their concerns, citizens can significantly influence how governments respond to climate challenges. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. However, governments may only respond minimally to public demands and fail to implement effective policies, so results are sometimes limited.. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:13:45.862Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:19:57.238Z

**Assistant:** Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision

Thank you for sharing your thesis statement:

> “I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”

Let’s review it together!

**Feedback:**
- **Clarity:** The thesis communicates your position (“partly agree”) and gives two key reasons (influence on government; personal lifestyle choices).
- **Strength:** The wording could be more assertive and specific. For example, “I partly agree…” is fine, but you might express confidence even with a nuanced position. Avoid “I think” (which you did—good job!) and aim for clear, precise preview of the essay’s direction.
- **Focus:** It’s mostly clear, but you could briefly preview *how* individuals influence government, and *how* personal choices matter—this helps set up your essay’s structure.

**Suggestions for Revision:**
- Consider rephrasing to directly answer the essay question.
- Make your position and main points stand out.
- Preview the structure: government influence + personal actions.
- Use confident language.

Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now, using those suggestions? If you like, I can offer you a model sentence for reference—but give it a shot first!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:20:01.072Z

**You:** Although individuals are not as powerful as governments or corporations, the importance of their actions should not be underestimated. Collective individual actions can influence government policy, and individual life style choice can impact company's behavior.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:25:41.231Z

**Assistant:** Great effort—you’re moving towards a stronger thesis! Here’s some feedback to help you refine it further:

**Positives:**
- You have replaced “I partly agree,” which makes it more assertive.
- You clearly mention both main points: influencing government policy and impacting company behavior.

**Possible Improvements:**
- The thesis could be even clearer by specifying *how* individuals have an impact.
- Try to avoid combining very broad ideas (“collective individual actions” and “individual lifestyle choice”) unless you link them directly to your essay’s main body paragraphs.
- Consider ensuring it previews both the essay’s structure (government influence + company influence through lifestyle choices).

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does your thesis tell readers your specific viewpoint on the issue?
- Does it clearly preview your two main supporting points?

**Would you like to try revising your thesis again—perhaps by directly stating how individuals can influence governments and companies?** Remember, keep it confident and try to be as specific as possible! If you’d like, I can offer an example after you give it another try.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:25:44.373Z

**You:** I'm good. Let's work on the topic sentence of the 1st body paragraph. The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:30:02.487Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic! Let’s focus on revising the topic sentence of your first body paragraph:

**Your current topic sentence:**
> The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

**Feedback:**
- **Strengths:** It’s clear and sets up your main idea—how individuals influence government.
- **Possible Improvements:** Since you have revised your thesis to emphasize *collective* impact and influencing *government policy*, you might want your topic sentence to reflect this connection even more directly.
- Consider using more specific or academic language (for example, “citizens,” “government policy,” “public pressure”) so it matches the thesis and guides readers.
- It’s helpful to reflect your essay’s nuanced position—this is “the most important way,” but perhaps connect why it is so significant.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does this topic sentence connect directly with your new, more assertive thesis?
- Is the language precise and academic?

Would you like to try revising this topic sentence so it clearly and confidently links individual action to influencing government climate policy? Give it a try, and I’ll offer suggestions or an example if needed!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:30:08.324Z

**You:** Please read my revised thesis and the content of body paragraph 1. Provide an example of a strong topic sentence.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:33:38.359Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Thank you for your thoughtful work so far. Let’s review your revised thesis and body paragraph 1 before I provide a model topic sentence.

**Your revised thesis:**
> Although individuals are not as powerful as governments or corporations, the importance of their actions should not be underestimated. Collective individual actions can influence government policy, and individual life style choice can impact company’s behavior.

**Body Paragraph 1 Content:**  
You discuss how individuals influence government and politicians, especially through public demand, protests, voting, and public opinion; you also mention some limitations, such as government ignoring the public or unclear communication.

---

### Example of a Strong Topic Sentence:

Here are a few models you might consider:

1. **Model Sentence:**  
Through collective action and public pressure, citizens play a crucial role in shaping government climate policy.

2. **Model Sentence:**  
Individuals make the greatest impact on climate change when they unite to demand strong environmental policies from their governments.

3. **Model Sentence:**  
By organizing, voting, and voicing their concerns, citizens can significantly influence how governments respond to climate challenges.

---

**Tips:**
- Clearly link to your thesis (“collective individual actions,” “influence government policy”).
- Use academic language (“citizens,” “public pressure,” “policy,” “impact”).
- Be assertive (no “maybe,” “might,” or “I think”).

Would you like to try rewriting your topic sentence using these examples as inspiration? If so, give it a shot! If you want, I can offer additional suggestions based on what you write.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:33:43.004Z

**You:** Thanks. Let's work on the body paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:37:11.007Z

**Assistant:** Great! We’re now at **Step 3: Revising the Rest of Body Paragraph 1**.

Let's make sure the **supporting sentences** clearly relate to your revised topic sentence and thesis. Here’s your current body paragraph (summarized for focus):

> By organizing, voting, and voicing their concerns, citizens can significantly influence how governments respond to climate challenges. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

#### Let’s use these **guiding questions**:

1. **Unity & Relevance:** Do all your points and examples clearly support your revised topic sentence—that citizens, through collective action, can shape government climate policies?
2. **Clarity:** Are there any sentences that could be made clearer or more formal/academic?
3. **Coherence:** Does the paragraph flow logically from point to point?
4. **Development:** Are your examples and explanations specific and fully developed?

**A few hints and prompts:**

- Your **first three supporting sentences** are strong and relevant.  
- Your **examples** (protests, voting, laws passed) help illustrate your point.
- The sentence about limitations (“But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little...”) is important, but consider making it clearer and more academic in tone.
- Try to avoid informal phrases (“nothing happen”) and check grammar (“maybe just listen a little”) to keep your academic tone.

**Would you like to:**
- Rephrase any sentences for clarity or academic style?
- Clarify your examples?
- Add a linking sentence to explain why public pressure sometimes succeeds and sometimes doesn’t?
- Remove anything off-topic?

*Would you like to try revising one or two of your sentences now?* Let me know which part you’d like to start with, or I can help you by identifying a sentence you might improve first!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:37:17.420Z

**You:** Please underline all informal expressions and suggest formal, academic alternatives.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T03:40:17.609Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let’s work through Step 3—**Revising the Rest of Body Paragraph 1.**

I’ll first point out the informal expressions in your paragraph by **underlining them**, then suggest formal, academic alternatives (**not a full rewrite—just suggestions or models for individual words/phrases**).  

**Here is your paragraph with informal expressions underlined:**

> By organizing, voting, and voicing their concerns, citizens can significantly influence how governments respond to climate challenges. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from **normal people** can have a **big effect**, even if individuals alone do not have much power. **But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.**

---

### **Suggestions for More Formal/Academic Alternatives:**

- **normal people**  
  *Suggestion*: "ordinary citizens," "the general public"

- **big effect**  
  *Suggestion*: "significant impact," "meaningful influence"

- **But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well.**  
  *Suggestion*: "However, governments may only respond minimally to public demands and fail to implement effective policies, so results are sometimes limited."

- **nothing happen**  
  *Suggestion*: "no substantial changes occur," "there is no noticeable policy response"

---

### **Prompts to Guide Your Revision**

- Would you like to try replacing "**normal people**" with a more academic term?
- How could you restate "**big effect**" for stronger, more formal language?
- For your sentences beginning "but sometimes...," can you try expressing the limitations of government response in a more precise, academic way?
- Can you clarify what you mean by "nothing happen," and explain *why* sometimes citizen communication doesn’t result in change?

*Would you like to try revising one or two sentences now?*  
If you aren’t sure which to start with, I recommend working on the sentence with "**But sometimes, the government...**" as it could be strengthened for clarity and academic tone.

Let me know which sentence you’d like to revise first!
