            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for confirming your targets and sharing your draft again. To proceed efficiently, I recommend this next step:

**Step 2 — Topic sentence revision**  
Your current topic sentence is:  
*“First, automation increases productivity by reducing people's hard work and enhance work efficiency.”*

Quick, focused feedback:  
- Verb agreement: “increases” is singular, so use “enhancing” (not “enhance”) after “and.”  
- Precision: “people’s hard work” is vague and informal. Try “manual labor,” “repetitive tasks,” or “time-consuming processes.”  
- Avoid redundancy: “reducing... hard work” and “enhance work efficiency” overlap. Choose one clear claim that summarizes how productivity increases.  
- Connect explicitly to the thesis point — increasing productivity.

Here are some scaffolds you can use to revise the topic sentence (choose one):  
- Template A (simple claim): *“Automation increases productivity by ________.”*  
- Template B (cause → effect): *“By allowing machines to perform ________, automation ________.”*  
- Template C (gerund style): *“Automating ________ increases operational efficiency and productivity by ________.”*

Would you like to:  
A) Try writing your own revised topic sentence now? (Paste it here, and I’ll give feedback.)  
B) See a short model example first?  

Let me know how you’d like to proceed!

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
In my opinions, I think Automation technological can shift ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.
Firstly, automation can reduce a lot of people hard work. It makes job more efficient. At some industries, we need so many people to work maybe ten days, one month or more. But automatic can do it all day and it can not feel busy. It can reduce basic investment on it. It can work all day.
Secondly, automation is a trend on the world. The technological is improving so automation conclude a lot of accepts. It is useful for us and has a lot of advantages on itself. We need to beef up and get the trend on technology. Not only the trend, but also an improving on it.
Third, it will reduce cost in the long term. One machine can use many years, and we don't need to pay attention on to many people just choice one person check it and maintain it is enough.
Global employment prospects need to consider a lot of aspects. In the long term, I think automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. No matter in cost, efficient or trend is a good way for us to use it. At the same time, we should to learn about how to use it and how to use it better. Know some basic skill on it. In the long term, it may enhance global employment prospects.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-28T11:07:30.136Z

**You:** Please help me polish the grammar and word choice of the article to make it more academic.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T11:45:44.241Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a helpful draft. Before I start revising, let’s follow the process so we work on the things you care about and make steady improvements.

1) Negotiate targets
- You said: “Please help me polish the grammar and word choice of the article to make it more academic.” That’s a great goal. To be most effective in one session, we should focus on 1–2 specific targets. Here are recommended options based on your request and the draft:
  A. Thesis clarity and strength (makes your argument clearer and previews the essay)
  B. Grammar and sentence-level accuracy (verb forms, articles, word order)
  C. Word choice and academic tone (more precise vocabulary, remove informal phrases)
  D. Paragraph structure (strong topic sentence and clear supporting sentences)

Which two of these would you most like us to focus on in this session? (If you’re not sure, I recommend A + B: revise the thesis, then fix grammar and word choice in one body paragraph.)

2) Diagnostic feedback (brief, using the rubric)
- Strengths
  - You have a clear overall position: automation is positive in the long term.
  - The essay has an immediate structure: you list several supporting points (efficiency, trend, cost).
- Areas for improvement (by rubric category)
  - Content & Ideas: Developing (3). Ideas are relevant but need clearer development and examples to be convincing.
  - Organisation & Logical Progression: Basic–Developing (2–3). You have separate points, but topic sentences and transitions are weak; paragraphs repeat similar ideas.
  - Vocabulary: Basic (2). Many word choice problems and repetitions (e.g., “automatic,” “automation conclude a lot of accepts”).
  - Grammar & Sentence Structure: Basic (2). Frequent errors with articles, verb forms, word order, and sentence fragments that affect clarity.

3) Student priority selection
- Which of the options A–D above do you choose to focus on now? Also tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (I suggest the first body paragraph about efficiency/hard work).

Once you confirm your chosen targets and the paragraph to work on, we’ll move into Step 1: revise the thesis. Would you like to focus on A + B (thesis clarity and grammar), or choose something else?

*Time:* 2025-11-28T11:46:08.457Z

**You:** A+B

*Time:* 2025-11-28T11:51:22.358Z

**Assistant:** Great — A + B (thesis clarity + grammar) and the first body paragraph is a good plan. Let’s begin Step 1.

Step 1 — Thesis statement
- Please paste your current thesis again (you already gave it, but paste if you made any small change): "In my opinions, I think Automation technological can shift ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term."
- Quick feedback on that thesis:
  - Clarity: It’s hard to follow because of word order and extra hedging (“In my opinions, I think”). Drop personal hedging and be direct.
  - Focus: It says automation “can” enhance prospects but doesn’t preview why. A strong thesis should state your clear position and briefly list the main reasons you will discuss (e.g., efficiency/productivity, long-term cost savings and new job roles, and the need for reskilling).
  - Language: Fix grammar (singular/plural, word order) and use confident language: “Automation will…” or “Automation ultimately enhances…”
- Now your turn: Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now, using those suggestions? Keep it one sentence, direct, and preview 2–3 main points.

If you’d like an example after you try, I can show one to compare — would you like that?

*Time:* 2025-11-28T11:51:43.618Z

**You:** yes

*Time:* 2025-11-28T11:56:04.286Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing A + B and the first body paragraph. Now please try rewriting your thesis as one clear, confident sentence that answers the question and previews 2–3 main reasons (for example: efficiency, long‑term cost savings/new job types, and reskilling opportunities).

Hints:
- Drop hedges like “I think” or “In my opinion.”
- Use strong verbs: “will” or “enhances.”
- Preview your main points in order (this guides your paragraphs).

Please paste your revised thesis when you’re ready. After you try it, I’ll give feedback and then (since you said yes) I’ll show a short model to compare.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T11:56:11.987Z

**You:** Automation technology can ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.
First, automation will reduce a lot of people hard work and enhances job more efficiency. In some industries, tasks that once required many workers and took maybe ten days, one month or more. But automation can work all day without getting tired, which reduces basic investment and enhances non-stop work.
Second, automation is a trend on the world. The technological is improving so automation conclude a lot of accepts. It is useful for us and has a lot of advantages on itself. We must keep up with this technological trend and even promote its further development.
Third, automation will reduce costs in the long term. One machine can be used for many years, and we don't need to pay attention on to many people just choice one person to check and maintain it is enough.
Global employment prospects need to consider many aspects. In the long term, automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs but enhances efficiency significantly. Whether in terms of cost, efficiency or trend, it is a good tool for us. At the same time, we must learn how to use it better. Know some basic skill on it. In the end, automation will enhance global employment prospects.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T12:24:55.035Z

**Assistant:** Nice—thanks for confirming A + B and that we’ll work on the first body paragraph. That’s a focused plan. Let’s finish Step 1 before moving on.

Quick feedback on your current thesis line
Current: "Automation technology can ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term."

- Strengths: Clear overall position (positive). Short and direct.
- Issues to fix:
  - Redundancy: “ultimately” and “in the long term” repeat the same idea—choose one.
  - Missing preview: It doesn’t tell the reader the main reasons you will prove (this makes the essay harder to follow).
  - Verb strength: “can” is weak. Use a firmer verb like “will” or “enhances” for academic tone.

Hints for your revision
- Drop hedges like “can” or “I think.” Be confident and specific.
- Add 2–3 brief reasons that match your paragraphs (e.g., greater efficiency/productivity, long‑term cost savings and new job opportunities, and the need for reskilling).
- Keep it one clear sentence.

If you prefer, I can show one short model after you try—would you like that?

*Time:* 2025-11-28T12:25:08.357Z

**You:** Automation technology will enhance global employment prospects by boosting efficiency, cutting long-term costs, and driving the need for reskilling-all while aligning with global technological trends.
First, automation will reduce people's hard work and enhance work efficiency. In some industries, tasks that once required many workers and took maybe ten days, one month or more can now be completed by automation. But automation can work all day without getting tired, which reduces basic investment and enhances non-stop work.
Second, automation is a global trend fueled by advancing technology. It encompasses diverse applications and boasts inherent advantages, so we must keep up with this technological trend and even promote its further development.
Third, automation will cut long-term costs for businesses. A single machine can be used for years, and instead of managing a large workforce, only one person is needed to monitor and maintain it.
Global employment prospects need to consider many aspects. In the long term, automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs but enhances efficiency significantly. Whether in terms of cost, efficiency or trend, it is a good tool for us. At the same time, we must learn how to use it better and master basic relevant skills. In the end, automation will enhance global employment prospects.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T12:47:39.128Z

**Assistant:** Nice revision — this is much clearer and more confident than the original. Good job removing hedging and listing reasons.

A few quick, focused points to strengthen it further:
- Typo/wording: “reskilling-all” is incorrect — remove the hyphen and rephrase (e.g., “driving demand for reskilling”).
- Redundancy and relevance: “aligning with global technological trends” is background, not a separate reason. Decide whether to keep it or fold it into another point.
- Match your essay structure: your body paragraphs discuss efficiency (para 1), global trend/technology (para 2), and cost (para 3). Your thesis should preview reasons in the same order so readers can follow.
- Keep parallel structure and concise phrasing. Use three coordinated noun phrases or gerunds (e.g., “increasing productivity, lowering long‑term costs, and creating demand for new skills”).

Hints for a one-sentence revision:
- Start boldly: “Automation will …”
- Preview 2–3 reasons in the same order as your paragraphs.
- Use parallel structure.

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now with those hints? Paste your new one-sentence thesis when you’re ready. If you prefer, I can show a short model after you try — would you like that?

*Time:* 2025-11-28T12:58:26.481Z

**Assistant:** Great — you’ve made strong progress and your plan (A + B, first body paragraph) is clear. Let’s finish Step 1 properly before moving on.

Quick, focused feedback on your current thesis:
"Automation technology will enhance global employment prospects by boosting work efficiency, aligning with global technological trends, and cutting long-term business costs."

What’s good
- Direct and confident — you removed hedging.
- It previews reasons, which helps reader orientation.

What to improve (keep these small and actionable)
- Redundancy: “aligning with global technological trends” is background rather than a clear reason. It also overlaps with “boosting work efficiency.” Consider replacing it with a concrete effect (e.g., “creating demand for new skills”).
- Parallel structure: use three matching phrases (all noun phrases or all gerunds) for clarity and flow.
- Word choice: prefer precise academic terms — “productivity” is stronger than “work efficiency”; “lowering long‑term costs” is clearer than “cutting long-term business costs.”

Hints to try now
- Start with a strong verb: “Automation will…”
- Use three parallel, concise reasons in the same order as your paragraphs: (1) productivity/efficiency, (2) technology trend / new roles or skills, (3) long-term cost savings.
- One sentence, no hedging.

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using those hints? Paste your one-sentence revision when you’re ready.

If you prefer, I can show one brief model after you try — would you like to see a model to compare?

*Time:* 2025-11-28T12:58:38.436Z

**You:** yes

*Time:* 2025-11-28T12:59:58.418Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for saying yes. Here’s a short model thesis that follows the tips we discussed (strong verb, no hedging, three parallel reasons that match your paragraphs):

Model thesis:
"Automation will enhance global employment prospects by increasing productivity, creating demand for new skills and jobs, and reducing long-term business costs."

Why this works (brief):
- Confident verb: "will" (no hedging).
- Parallel structure: three coordinated noun phrases.
- Matches your paragraph order: productivity (para 1), new skills/roles (para 2), cost savings (para 3).

Would you like to:
A) Use this model thesis as your revised thesis? (If yes, I’ll insert it into your essay and show the full updated text.)
B) Try rewriting your own thesis now using this model as a guide? (Paste your one-sentence revision and I’ll give quick feedback.)

Which do you prefer?

*Time:* 2025-11-28T13:00:10.472Z

*Time:* 2025-11-28T13:03:01.033Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — your thesis is much stronger now: direct, confident, and it previews your main points. Are you happy to keep the thesis as it stands? (If you want one tiny change, tell me now; otherwise we’ll move to the paragraph work.)

Step 2 — Topic sentence (first body paragraph)
Please paste the current topic sentence you want to revise (you already have it as: "First, automation will reduce people's hard work and enhance work efficiency."). Good — that gives us a place to improve.

Quick feedback on that topic sentence and how it connects to your thesis
- Connection to thesis: It links to the thesis idea of increasing productivity, but the wording is informal and partly redundant (both “reduce people’s hard work” and “enhance work efficiency” say similar things).
- Academic tone and precision: Replace informal phrasing (“people’s hard work”) with a precise term like “productivity” or “operational efficiency.”
- Focus: A strong topic sentence should state the main claim of the paragraph and signal the kind of support you will give (e.g., automation speeds up repetitive tasks, works continuously, and raises output).

Scaffolds you can use to rewrite (pick one and fill in details)
- Template A (gerund phrase style): "Increasing productivity by automating repetitive tasks, automation …"
- Template B (noun-phrase style): "Automation increases productivity by …"
- Template C (cause→effect style): "By allowing machines to perform [type of tasks], automation [effect on productivity/need for labor]."

Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence now using one of those scaffolds? Paste your revised topic sentence and I’ll give focused feedback. (If you prefer, I can show a short model sentence to compare — would you like that?)

*Time:* 2025-11-28T13:03:21.553Z

**You:** yes

*Time:* 2025-11-28T13:08:07.485Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for saying yes. Quick reminder of your thesis we'll connect to:
"Automation will enhance global employment prospects by increasing productivity, creating demand for new skills and jobs, and reducing long-term business costs."

Now please paste your revised topic sentence for the first body paragraph.

If it helps, here are three short scaffolds you can use — pick one and fill in details:
- Template A (simple claim): "Automation increases productivity by ________."
- Template B (cause→effect): "By allowing machines to perform ________, automation ________."
- Template C (gerund style): "Automating repetitive tasks, ________, increases operational efficiency and productivity."

Try one now and paste it here. I’ll give focused feedback and then we’ll revise the supporting sentences in that paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T13:08:16.977Z

*Time:* 2025-11-28T13:13:02.862Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a clear plan and a strong start. Quick recap so we stay on track:

- Agreed targets: A (Thesis clarity & strength) and B (Grammar and sentence-level accuracy).  
- Paragraph to revise: first body paragraph (the one about productivity/efficiency).  
- Current thesis you’re using:  
  "Automation will enhance global employment prospects by increasing productivity, creating demand for new skills and jobs, and reducing long-term business costs."  
  Are you happy to keep that thesis as-is? If yes, we’ll move to Step 2. If you want one small tweak, tell me now.

Step 2 — Topic sentence revision (first body paragraph)

Your current topic sentence:
"First, automation increases productivity by reducing people's hard work and enhance work efficiency."

Quick feedback (focused, actionable)
- Grammar: verb mismatch — you have “increases” and then “enhance” (should be “enhancing” or “enhances” to match).
- Tone & precision: “people’s hard work” is informal and vague. Use a precise academic phrase like “repetitive tasks,” “manual labor,” or “low-skill, routine work.”
- Redundancy: “reducing people’s hard work” and “enhance work efficiency” overlap. Pick one clear claim and signal the paragraph’s support (e.g., continuous operation, speed, output).
- Connection to thesis: Make the link explicit to “increasing productivity” from your thesis so readers can see how this paragraph supports the whole essay.

Try one of these scaffolds to rewrite the topic sentence (pick one and fill the blanks):
- Template A (simple claim): "Automation increases productivity by ________."  
- Template B (cause → effect): "By allowing machines to perform ________, automation ________."  
- Template C (gerund style): "Automating ________ increases operational efficiency and productivity by ________."

Hints for phrasing
- Replace informal words with specific terms: repetitive tasks, manual labor, routine manufacturing tasks, data-processing tasks, etc.
- Show the type of evidence you’ll give: continuous operation, faster output, fewer errors, higher throughput.
- Keep it one clear, grammatical sentence.

**You:** Automation will enhance global employment prospects by increasing productivity, creating demand for new skills and jobs, and reducing long-term business costs.
First, automation increases productivity by reducing people's hard work and enhance work efficiency. In some industries, tasks that once required many workers and took maybe ten days, one month or more can now be completed by automation. But automation can work all day without getting tired, which reduces basic investment and ensures non-stop productivity.
Second, automation is a global trend fueled by advancing technology. It encompasses diverse applications and boasts inherent advantages, so we must keep up with this technological trend and even promote its further development.
Third, automation will cut long-term costs for businesses. A single machine can be used for years, and instead of managing a large workforce, only one person is needed to monitor and maintain it. Lower overhead costs enable businesses to expand and innovate, indirectly creating more employment opportunities.
Global employment prospects need to consider many aspects. In the long term, automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs but enhances efficiency significantly. Whether in terms of cost, efficiency or trend, it is a good tool for us. At the same time, we must learn how to use it better and master basic relevant skills. In the end, automation will enhance global employment prospects.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T13:18:19.040Z

**Assistant:** This is a good place to be — focused and ready to improve. Quick check before we continue:

- Agreed targets: A (thesis clarity & strength) and B (grammar & sentence accuracy).  
- Paragraph to revise: first body paragraph (the one about productivity/efficiency).  
- Current thesis I’ll keep as our working thesis (unless you want a tiny change):  
  "Automation will enhance global employment prospects by increasing productivity, creating demand for new skills and jobs, and reducing long-term business costs."  
Are you happy to keep this thesis as-is? (Yes / No — and if No, say what you want changed.)

Step 2 — Topic sentence (first body paragraph)
You gave this topic sentence:  
"First, automation increases productivity by reducing people's hard work and enhance work efficiency."

Focused feedback (short and practical)
- Grammar: verb form mismatch — "increases" then "enhance" is incorrect. Use "enhancing" or make both verbs match.
- Precision/tone: "people’s hard work" is informal and vague. Replace with a specific phrase: repetitive tasks, manual labour, routine manufacturing tasks, or time-consuming processes.
- Redundancy: “reducing people’s hard work” and “enhance work efficiency” overlap. Make one clear, precise claim about how productivity increases (e.g., automation performs repetitive tasks continuously and with fewer errors).
- Link to thesis: Make the connection explicit to “increasing productivity” so the paragraph clearly supports the thesis.

Scaffolds — pick one and fill the blanks
- Template A (simple claim): "Automation increases productivity by ________."  
- Template B (cause → effect): "By allowing machines to perform _______, automation ________."  
- Template C (gerund style): "Automating ________ increases operational efficiency and productivity by ________."

Try rewriting the topic sentence now (one clear sentence). Would you like:
A) To try your own revision first? — Paste it here and I’ll give focused feedback.  
B) To see one short model example now to compare?  

After you post your revised topic sentence, we’ll move to Step 3 and work on revising the supporting sentences in that paragraph for clarity, unity, and grammar.
