            ## Contribution Analysis

            It looks like you have a clear understanding of the problem and the two main viewpoints (government/corporate action and individual efforts). To improve your thesis statement, focus on making it concise and clearly stating your position with the two key points that will guide your essay.

Here’s a simple revision example based on your ideas:

**Example Thesis:**  
"Although government and corporate actions are crucial to combating climate change, I believe that individuals also play an important role through influencing policymakers and adopting environmentally friendly habits."

You might try writing a similar sentence yourself, focusing on:

- Your agreement or partial agreement with the statement.  
- The two ways individuals can help (influence government + personal lifestyle changes).

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Great—let’s begin with Step 1: **Thesis Statement Revision**.

**Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**

Can you please share the thesis statement from your essay? (It is usually at the end of your introduction and should clearly answer the essay question.)

Here’s your first paragraph for reference:
> Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

**Tasks:**
1. Please paste your current thesis statement.
2. I’ll give you targeted feedback on **clarity, strength, and focus**.
3. You’ll try rewriting it based on my advice.

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement! Here’s what I see:

**Feedback on your thesis:**
- **Clarity:** The thesis could be more concise and focused. Currently, it mixes several ideas and is a bit hard to follow.
- **Strength:** Phrases like “I partly agree,” while useful, should be more direct. Try to avoid vague language.
- **Focus:** The thesis should clearly say what your main position is and what points you’ll discuss. Right now, it jumps between individual actions, government influence, and group cooperation.

**Suggestions:**
- Try combining your main position in one confident sentence.
- Preview the main points you will explore in your body paragraphs (e.g., government influence, individual actions).
- Use clear, formal vocabulary (avoid “I think” or “maybe”).

**Guiding Questions:**
- What do you think is the MOST important way individuals can help with climate change?
- Do you agree that government action is more important, or do you think individual action matters just as much?

**Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now based on this feedback?** (Just write one or two sentences for your thesis!) Let me know if you need a little more help or an example before you try.
