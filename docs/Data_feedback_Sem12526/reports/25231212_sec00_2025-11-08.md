            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for the detailed paragraph! Let’s focus on revising one of the less clear sentences to improve clarity and academic tone.

Here’s the sentence for revision:  
**“But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well.”**

---

### Example of a clearer, more formal revision:  
“However, governments sometimes respond only partially to public pressure and fail to implement strong environmental policies, which limits the effectiveness of individual influence.”

---

Would you like to try rewriting this sentence yourself using similar ideas?  
If you prefer, I can help revise the other unclear sentence next:
**“Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.”**

Just let me know which sentence you want to work on first, or if you want me to offer a full revised version of the paragraph at once!

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do.  I believe citizens can still influence the government’s policies as citizens who vote to express their views and shape corporate behaviors as consumers who make certain purchasing decisions; as a result, despite the limitations of individuals’ efforts, people can fight against climate changes forcefully and collectively as a community.

Individuals could affect how the governments make decisions on climate policies by expressing their views through voting, writing and protesting. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.


On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-08T06:46:09.043Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-08T06:50:49.170Z

**Assistant:** Great, thank you for sharing your original thesis statement:

> I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

**Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision**

Let’s look at your thesis together. Here’s some constructive feedback:

- **Clarity:** Your main idea comes through, but the sentence is a bit long and has many ideas packed together, which can make it hard for the reader to follow.
- **Strength and Focus:** Good job showing your position (“partly agree”), but the thesis would be stronger if you more clearly previewed the structure—what *two* main roles you will discuss, and right up front linked them to your essay question.
- **Confident Language:** Try to state your ideas directly and avoid softening phrases like "I think."

**Tips for Improvement:**
- Directly answer the question (“Do individual actions matter as much as what governments/companies do?”).
- Clearly preview the two main points (influence on government, and personal lifestyle choices).
- Use clear and confident language.

**Guided Prompt:**
Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement now, based on those suggestions? Make sure it clearly says whether individual actions matter, and how you’ll discuss both influencing the government and personal choices.

If you'd like more support, I can give you a model structure—just let me know!

*Time:* 2025-11-08T06:50:53.828Z

**You:** I believe citizens can still influence the government’s policies as citizens who vote to express their views and shape corporate behaviors as consumers who make certain purchasing decisions; as a result, despite the limitations of individuals’ efforts, people can fight against climate changes forcefully and collectively as a community.

*Time:* 2025-11-08T06:51:20.362Z

**Assistant:** Nice work on rewriting your thesis statement! Let’s review it together:

> I believe citizens can still influence the government’s policies as citizens who vote to express their views and shape corporate behaviors as consumers who make certain purchasing decisions; as a result, despite the limitations of individuals’ efforts, people can fight against climate changes forcefully and collectively as a community.

**Feedback:**
- **Clarity:** This is clearer than before and divides the two main ways individuals can make a difference (influencing government and companies).
- **Strength:** You use confident language, which is good (“people can fight against climate change forcefully and collectively”).
- **Preview:** You’ve signaled you will discuss both political action and consumer choices, which helps preview essay structure.
- **Focus:** The sentence is still quite long. Breaking it into two shorter sentences could increase impact and clarity.

**Suggestions:**
1. Make sure the thesis directly answers the essay question first. For example: "Individual actions can significantly contribute to combating climate change," and then explain *how*.
2. Clarify the link between 'influencing government', 'consumer behavior', and the overall essay argument.
3. Try to keep technical terms accurate—say "climate change" instead of "climate changes."

**Guided Prompt:**
Would you like to adjust your thesis statement to make it even clearer?  
You could try separating your main claim from the preview of supporting points.  
For example, start with: "Individual actions remain essential in combating climate change,"  
then add: "because citizens can influence government policies through voting and public advocacy,  
and shape company practices through mindful consumer choices."  
Would you like to try revising your sentence with these tips?

Let me know if you’re happy with your thesis or if you’d like to make another revision before moving to Step 2!

*Time:* 2025-11-08T06:51:25.647Z

**You:** let's move on

*Time:* 2025-11-08T06:51:45.958Z

**Assistant:** Great! Now that you’re comfortable with your revised thesis statement, let’s move on to **Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision**.

**Your Next Step:**  
Please choose *one* body paragraph you’d like to work on next.  
Let me know which paragraph you want to focus on—for example, would you like to revise the first body paragraph about influencing government and politicians, or the second one about personal lifestyle choices?

Once you’ve picked the paragraph, copy and paste its topic sentence here. Then, we’ll look at how well it connects to your revised thesis statement and make sure it clearly previews the paragraph’s main idea.

Ready to continue? Which paragraph would you like to revise?

*Time:* 2025-11-08T06:51:49.105Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

*Time:* 2025-11-08T06:52:01.668Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing the topic sentence from your first body paragraph:

> The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

**Feedback:**
- **Connection to Thesis:** This topic sentence addresses one of the key ideas from your revised thesis (individuals influencing government), which is excellent.
- **Clarity:** It’s clear and direct.
- **Strength:** You use a strong phrase, “the most important way,” which communicates priority and focus.
- **Specificity:** It could be even more specific about *how* individuals influence government, such as through voting, advocacy, or expressing public opinion—these are ideas you previewed in your thesis.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Try to echo the language of your thesis (mention voting, public advocacy, or collective action if possible).
- Clarify what kind of influence individuals have on government policies.
- If you’d like, state why this influence is central to the climate change issue.

**Guiding Question:**  
Would you like to make your topic sentence a little more specific and directly aligned with your thesis? For example, you might include the idea of citizens voting or joining advocacy efforts.

Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now? If you’d like a model or example sentence structure, just let me know!

Once your topic sentence feels strong, we’ll move to revising the rest of the paragraph together.

*Time:* 2025-11-08T06:52:06.115Z

**You:** Individuals could affect how the governments make decisions on climate policies by expressing their views through voting, writing and protesting.

*Time:* 2025-11-08T06:52:23.603Z

**Assistant:** Nice work revising your topic sentence! Let’s look at your updated version:

> Individuals could affect how the governments make decisions on climate policies by expressing their views through voting, writing and protesting.

**Feedback:**

- **Connection to Thesis:** This links well to your thesis, which highlights the influence of individuals through voting and advocacy.
- **Clarity:** Clear explanation of the different ways individuals can participate.
- **Strength:** Using “could affect” is accurate, but you can use even more confident language — for example, “can influence” or “play a crucial role in shaping.”
- **Specificity:** Good job including “voting, writing and protesting.” If you’d like, you could mention “climate policies” right up front for focus.

**Guided Prompt:**
Would you like to try increasing the confidence of your statement?  
Think about changing "could affect" to "can influence" or "play a vital role in shaping."

For example, you might write:  
“Individuals can influence government decisions on climate policies through voting, public advocacy, and protest.”

Would you like to adjust your topic sentence now, or are you happy with it as is?

---

Once you’re satisfied, let’s move on to **Step 3: Revising the Rest of the Paragraph**.

Here’s how we’ll proceed next:

**Guiding Questions:**
- Do your supporting details clearly relate to the updated topic sentence (individuals influencing government decisions through voting, advocacy, and protest)?
- Is your explanation about citizens’ actions, public pressure, and examples clearly connected to the idea of shaping climate policy?
- Are there places where you could expand or clarify how these specific activities have created real change, or mention any challenges individuals face in influencing government?

**Would you like to start reviewing the supporting sentences now and make adjustments?  
If you need help with a specific sentence or idea, let me know — I’m here to guide you through each part step-by-step!**

Go ahead and share the paragraph, and we’ll work through your revisions together.

*Time:* 2025-11-08T06:52:29.095Z

**You:** please explain a bit more the differences between can and could referring to some linguistic concepts 

Tip: ask AI to explain its suggestions further and critically review the responses

*Time:* 2025-11-08T06:53:04.421Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let’s look at the difference between **can** and **could**—especially in your topic sentence—by considering their linguistic functions and how they affect your essay’s tone and strength.

### Key Differences: Can vs. Could

**1. Modality: Expressing Possibility vs. Ability**
- **Can**:  
  - Describes present ability or possibility—something is realistic, likely, or generally true.
  - Example: “Individuals can influence government decisions…” (means they are truly able to do this in the present situation.)
- **Could**:  
  - Describes hypothetical, less certain, or potential ability. Sometimes used for polite or tentative suggestions.
  - Example: “Individuals could affect government decisions…” (suggests it may be possible, but it’s less definite—perhaps more theoretical or only under certain conditions.)

**2. Tone: Confidence vs. Caution**
- **Can** makes your statement sound confident and assertive.  
  - It tells your reader you believe this is a real, present possibility—your claim is stronger.
- **Could** gives a softer, more cautious tone.  
  - It might seem less sure—suggesting that this isn’t always possible or is less direct.

**3. Academic Writing: Precision and Strength**
- In academic essays, **can** is usually preferred when you want to make clear, strong claims—especially in your thesis or topic sentences.
- **Could** is useful if you want to discuss conditions, limitations, or possibilities that are less certain.

**Linguistic Concepts in Action:**
- **Modals** (can, could, may, might) are verbs that express possibility, ability, permission, or necessity.
  - **Can** is an example of an epistemic modal expressing factual possibility or capability.
  - **Could** is a conditional/hypothetical modal, showing uncertainty or potentiality.

### Critical Review Example
- AI suggested: “Individuals can influence government decisions on climate policies…”  
  - **Why?** This matches your thesis’s confidence, creates a direct connection, and signals to the reader you are making an argument—not just a suggestion.
- If you use “could affect,” it may sound like you’re unsure whether this really happens.
- In your essay, “can” makes your point clear and shows you believe in the power of individual action.

**Critical Thinking Tip:**  
Ask, "Do I want my reader to feel sure this influence happens, or am I only suggesting it might?"

---

Would you like to respond with your thoughts on this explanation?  
Do you agree with using **can** for a stronger claim?  
Is there a place in your paragraph where “could” might work better if you’re discussing limitations or hypothetical outcomes?

Feel free to ask for more clarification or give your own analysis—I’ll support your critical review!

*Time:* 2025-11-08T06:53:11.283Z

**You:** move on

*Time:* 2025-11-08T06:53:52.335Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! Now let’s move to **Step 3: Revising the Rest of the Paragraph** (first body paragraph about influencing government).

Please review your supporting sentences in the the paragraph. Here is the section:

> When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

**Let’s focus on clarity, unity, and coherence:**

1. **Check unity:** Do all the examples and explanations connect directly to your improved topic sentence—that individuals can influence government climate policy through voting, advocacy, or protest?
2. **Coherence:** Is the logic clear from one idea to the next? Do you explain *how* public action creates change?
3. **Development:** Is there enough explanation after each example? Could you add a brief, concrete example (real or hypothetical) for depth?
4. **Transitions:** Are there smooth links between the positive and negative points (the limits of influence)?
5. **Precision:** Are there vague phrases (“maybe just listen a little,” “so nothing happen”) that could be clearer?

**Guiding Questions for Revision:**
- How can you strengthen the explanation of “why” public actions (like voting/protesting) succeed or sometimes fail?
- Can you use more formal or academic vocabulary to clarify where needed?
- Are there areas you wish to clarify or expand, especially about the challenges or limitations of individual influence?

**Revision Strategies:**  
Try revising one or two sentences at a time—think about whether you need to make them more precise, better connected, or more fully explained. You do not have to rewrite the whole paragraph—focus on targeted improvements.

**Would you like to start by revising a sentence you think needs improvement?**  
Tell me which one and try your revision—I’ll give feedback and guide you further!

Or, if you’d like me to point out the *most important* place to revise, just ask!

*Time:* 2025-11-08T06:53:59.678Z

**You:** When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

*Time:* 2025-11-08T06:54:27.204Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic—thank you for sharing the full paragraph! Let’s revise it step by step, focusing on unity, coherence, and clarity.

### 1. Checking Unity  
Your topic sentence says:  
> Individuals can influence government decisions on climate policies through voting, public advocacy, and protest.

All your examples and explanations should show *how* citizen actions (like voting or protesting) shape what governments do about climate change.

---

### 2. Sentence-by-Sentence Review

Let’s look at your supporting sentences:

**a.** "When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act."  
- Good! This directly supports your topic sentence.  

**b.** "For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy."  
- Great example. You might clarify the connection: How does this lead to actual change?  

**c.** "In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions."  
- Consider naming a country (for more academic credibility) or just say “For instance, in several countries, strong public movements have resulted in stricter regulations on plastic use or carbon emissions.”

**d.** "This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power."  
- Good analysis—maybe use “ordinary citizens” instead of “normal people” for more academic tone.  

**e.** "But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well."  
- This sentence is unclear. Try clarifying the idea: Sometimes governments only respond weakly to public pressure, or public opinion does not always result in policy change.  

**f.** "Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen."  
- This also needs more precision: Sometimes individuals lack effective ways to communicate with policymakers, so their concerns are not addressed.

---

### 3. Guiding Revision Steps

Let’s make some targeted improvements. Here are some questions and prompts:

#### a) Would you like to clarify either of these sentences?
- “But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well.”
- “Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.”

Try rephrasing just one of these sentences to make it clearer—focusing on **why** individual efforts might be limited in influencing government policy.

---

**Your turn:**  
Pick one unclear sentence, and try revising it to be more formal and precise (for example, explain what makes governments sometimes ignore public pressure, or why communication might fail).

Would you like to try now? Or if you want me to show a possible revision technique, just let me know!
