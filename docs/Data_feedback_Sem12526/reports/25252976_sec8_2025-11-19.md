            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for your request to develop your final paragraph! Let’s work together to create a clear, detailed, and effective conclusion that restates your thesis, summarizes your main ideas, and leaves a strong final impression.

---

### Step 2: Revise the Conclusion Topic Sentence

Your original topic sentence was:

> “In summam. migrants workers who are not familiar with # a Strange countries may face many exploitation.”

This sentence needs to be clearer and more formal. Here’s a suggested revision:

> In conclusion, migrant workers who are unfamiliar with foreign countries often face many forms of exploitation and unfair treatment.

Would you like to keep this version, adjust it, or try writing your own? Feel free to type your revision!

---

### Step 3: Develop the Rest of the Conclusion Paragraph

Now, let’s add detail by summarizing your main reasons and ending with a strong final thought. Here is a full draft example based on your essay’s ideas:

> In conclusion, migrant workers who are unfamiliar with foreign countries often face many forms of exploitation and unfair treatment. Stricter laws are essential because they ensure fair wages and reasonable working hours, while also protecting workers from abuse and unsafe conditions. Governments must enforce these laws effectively to safeguard the rights and welfare of migrant workers, helping them work with dignity and security.

---

### Your Turn!

- You can use the example above as a model to write your own conclusion paragraph, or  
- Type your own draft conclusion topic sentence or full paragraph here, and I will help you revise it for clarity and detail.

Let’s make your final paragraph strong and clear!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 16/25 – The student demonstrates a basic grasp of the topic and takes a clear stance, but ideas lack development, specificity, and depth. Supporting arguments are vague and examples are incomplete.
- Organization: 15/25 – The essay follows a basic structure (introduction, supporting paragraphs, conclusion), but paragraphing is unclear, topic sentences are weak, and ideas are not logically linked.
- Vocabulary: 14/25 – Some key terms are used (“regulations,” “migrant workers”), but frequent incorrect, awkward, or incomplete word choices reduce clarity and limit impact.
- Grammar: 13/25 – Grammar errors are frequent, including sentence fragments, run-ons, mismatched tenses, and misspelled words. These seriously impede understanding.
- **Original Essay Total: 58/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 – Some improvements in the assertion of viewpoint (clearer thesis), but supporting reasons and explanations remain underdeveloped. A new thesis is present but other ideas are still vague.
- Organization: 16/25 – The revised essay includes a thesis and reorganizes some sentences for clarity, but paragraph unity and transition remain weak. Topic sentences are not well formulated.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 – A slightly wider range and improved clarity in the thesis, but awkward phrasing and wrong word forms persist elsewhere.
- Grammar: 14/25 – Minor corrections increase clarity, but sentence structure is still problematic and multiple grammatical errors still occur.
- **Revised Essay Total: 62/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +4 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clarified the thesis statement to more directly answer the essay question (“Governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers because these laws guarantee fair working conditions and prevent exploitation.”)
  - The revised essay integrates some clearer reasons for the student’s stance.
  - Slight correction of some vocabulary and grammar errors in the introduction and thesis area.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Body paragraphs lack logical development and support; topic sentences are still vague or misplaced.
  - Grammar and sentence structure remain weak, with ambiguous phrasing.
  - The conclusion was not fully revised; lacks clarity and fails to effectively summarize points.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 20**
- **Conversation Quality: The student provided full versions of the essay and responded to prompts about their goals (clarity). However, revision steps were not completed as prescribed; the student was often off-task, repeating body paragraphs or failing to produce the requested thesis or topic sentences. Student engagement with the AI was minimal and unfocused, with few complete answers.**

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 – There was a moderate number of exchanges, but most of the student’s input was copying whole paragraphs or brief answers (e.g., “make” or “yes”), which hindered deeper discussion. The student did not ask meaningful questions or explore multiple options with the AI.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 – The student did not provide evidence-based justifications for accepting or rejecting AI feedback; most responses were non-committal (“make”, “yes”) or simply repeated their previous writing. Suggestions were not discussed critically.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 – The revision process was not completed. The student did not revise a topic sentence or a body paragraph fully. There was no iterative process; instead, the student continued to paste full sections or failed to reply with targeted revisions.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 6/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Demonstrated willingness to participate in the AI revision workflow.
- Attempted to clarify the thesis with AI support.
- Chose a revision focus (clarity) at the start of the session.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Needs to follow and complete each revision step; topic sentences and paragraphs were not properly revised.
- Should actively engage with AI prompts, trying to answer directly and provide own draft sentences rather than copying whole paragraphs.
- Needs substantially more critical analysis and decision-making in reviewing AI suggestions.
- Should focus on iterative improvement: revise, receive feedback, and adjust further.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement – The student stated a general goal (clarity) but did not expand, nor provide deeper context about the essay or its weaknesses.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement – Did not follow the AI’s strategic, stepwise workflow; repeatedly pasted content instead of working through thesis/topic/paragraph revision.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement – No evidence of critical discussion; responses were brief and non-analytical.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement – The student did not generate original sentences in revision steps, relying on unmodified text or minimal responses.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing Skills:** Carefully read and follow each revision instruction. When asked to revise a sentence, try to write a new version in your own words and be specific.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills:** Engage thoughtfully with AI—answer questions fully, ask clarifying questions, and critically consider feedback. Take the opportunity to discuss different choices or ask for examples when unclear.
3. **Overall Improvement:** Practice breaking large writing tasks into smaller steps (thesis, topic sentences, paragraphs) and revise each in turn. Review grammar fundamentals, and read model essays to develop clearer academic English.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student did not complete the required revision steps (thesis statement, topic sentence, body paragraph).
- Engagement with AI was minimal, responses were brief and non-specific, and revision workflow was not followed.
- Recommend targeted instruction in paragraph writing and revision techniques; a one-on-one writing workshop may be beneficial.
- The student should be reminded of the importance of active participation and critical thinking in collaborative writing processes.

For example, the government can & develop the regulation due to the problems that the migrant workerg facing. With the issue of long working hours. the government could require each of the fortony not let the worker working more than & hours. If they dont obey, there will be setions punishment. With the help o-stricter laws to safeguard their rights. a better working environment can be deformed and the efficency of worker can also be developed.
Second, the stricter law was written by the government after long period of discussion. Aft As is known to au. the publicment of a the law must be checked and agreed after man people's discusson. So the stricter law could be reasonable and convincing unich makes ine factories ought to obey. For examply, whee ete face of the unfair pay, the workers want to fight against but

Revised:

Governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers because these laws guarantee fair working conditions and prevent exploitation. then what can protect? For example, the government can  develop the regulation due to the problems that the migrant worker facing. With the issue of long working hours. the government could require each of the fortony not let the worker working more than & hours. If they don't obey, there will be punishment. With the help o-stricter laws to safeguard their rights. a better working environment can be deformed and the efficiency of worker can also be developed.
Second, the stricter law was written by the government after long period of discussion. Aft As is known to au. the publication of a the law must be checked and agreed after man people's discussion. So the stricter law could be reasonable and convincing which makes factories ought to obey. For example, facing of the unfair pay, the workers want to fight against but

Then the issue of unfair pay can be perfectly solved. In this way  the stricter lows the government enforced, the rights of the migrant workers are better protected. Bills are only passed to form laws after long periods of discussion with interests of stakeholders taken into consideration. Legislation will provide the basis and guidelines for employers and workers to follow, so their rights can be protected.
In summary. migrants workers who are not familiar with  a Strange countries may face many exploitation.
With the publication of the stricter laws, they can be the lows wisely to safeguard and fight for the welfare

*Time:* 2025-11-19T11:18:40.692Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let’s start by following the structured, interactive revision workflow as outlined.

---

**Preliminary Stage — Negotiating Targets and Diagnosing the Essay**

**1. Negotiate Targets**

First, let’s talk about your personal goals.  
*What do you most want to improve in your essay today?*  
- For example: Clarity? Argument strength? Structure? Grammar? Style? Vocabulary?

Please tell me in your own words what you’d like to focus on.

---

**2. Diagnostic Feedback**

Based on your draft and the rubric, here is my brief diagnosis:

- **Content and Ideas**: Your essay shows a clear opinion (that governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers). The basic ideas are relevant, but need stronger development and more specific examples. Some sentences are unclear.
    - *Rubric level: Developing (3/5)*
- **Organization and Logical Progression**: You follow a logical order (introduction, reasons, conclusion), but the paragraphs are hard to follow and ideas sometimes jump around. Some sentences are incomplete or disconnected.
    - *Rubric level: Developing (3/5)*
- **Vocabulary**: You use some topic-specific words (like "regulation", "salary", "migrant workers"), but there are errors and sometimes unclear word choices.
    - *Rubric level: Developing (3/5)*
- **Grammar and Sentence Structure**: There are frequent grammar errors which make your meaning unclear sometimes. Sentences are often incomplete or run-on, and there is limited variety.
    - *Rubric level: Basic–Developing (2–3/5)*

**Strengths:**  
- You have a viewpoint and basic supporting points.
- You attempt to use academic and topic-specific vocabulary.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- Thesis clarity and sentence structure.
- More logical, clear topic sentences for each body paragraph.
- Fixing grammar and coherence issues within paragraphs.

---

**3. Student Priority Selection**

Now, of all the points above, *which would you most like to focus on for this revision?*

**Examples:**  
- Making the thesis clearer and stronger  
- Improving paragraph organization and topic sentences  
- Fixing grammar and sentence structure  
- Expanding examples and explanations  
- Using better vocabulary

*Please tell me your top 1–2 priorities for this session! (We will still follow the workflow, but I’ll focus my feedback on your chosen points.)*

---

**Please reply with your priorities, and we’ll start Step 1 (Thesis Statement Revision).**

---

*(If you’d like me to recommend a priority: because your thesis and organization are the “backbone” of your essay, I suggest focusing on thesis clarity and topic sentences first—grammar can be polished more easily after the ideas are clear. But it’s your choice!)*

*Time:* 2025-11-19T11:18:50.104Z

**You:** Clarity

*Time:* 2025-11-19T11:19:30.276Z

**Assistant:** Great, thank you for sharing your priority!  
**You want to focus on clarity** in your essay. That’s an excellent choice—clear writing helps your reader easily understand your ideas and argument.

Just to confirm:  
- Our main target will be making your thesis and topic sentences clear, logical, and easy to follow.  
- We’ll also check the clarity of your examples and explanations in the body paragraph.

Let's begin our revision workflow!

---

### Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision

**Please copy and paste your current thesis statement here** (the one sentence that directly answers the essay question about whether governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights).

If you’re not sure which sentence is your thesis, just tell me, and I’ll help you find it!

---

*Once you share your thesis statement, I’ll give specific feedback and help you revise it for maximum clarity.*

*Time:* 2025-11-19T11:19:34.000Z

**You:** First, law is the powerful and also the basic tool to let people obey.

*Time:* 2025-11-19T11:20:15.142Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing this sentence:  
**“First, law is the powerful and also the basic tool to let people obey.”**

Let’s review it together:

---

**Feedback:**

- **Clarity:** This sentence does not clearly answer the essay question or state your viewpoint. It’s more a general claim about law than a thesis statement.
- **Focus:** A thesis statement should directly answer the essay prompt (Should governments enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers?).
- **Preview:** Your thesis should briefly mention the main reasons you will discuss.
- **Confidence:** Try to use direct, confident language (not “I think” or “maybe”).

---

**Let’s try together! Here are two guiding questions:**

1. What is your clear opinion—should governments enforce stricter laws for migrant workers?
2. Why? (Can you mention two main reasons in one sentence?)

---

**Model for Thesis Statement:**
*(Don’t copy! This is just an example for your reference—please write your own draft first.)*

> Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers because these laws guarantee fair working conditions and prevent exploitation.

---

**Your turn! Try rewriting your thesis statement in one clear, strong sentence. Start with:**

> Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers because...

Or you can choose your own wording.

**Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now?**  
*Go ahead and type your improved version!*

*Time:* 2025-11-19T11:20:18.881Z

**You:** econd, the stricter law was written by the government after long period of discussion.

*Time:* 2025-11-19T11:21:41.955Z

**Assistant:** Great effort sharing that sentence! However, the one you posted (“Second, the stricter law was written by the government after long period of discussion.”) is a topic sentence for the second body paragraph—not your thesis statement for the whole essay.

**Let’s focus on Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision.**

---

### Guided Revision – Thesis Statement

**Reminder:**  
Your thesis is usually found in the introduction and does three things:
1. Clearly answers the essay question (“Should governments make stricter laws for migrant workers?”)
2. Shows your viewpoint
3. Mentions your main reasons (these become your topic sentences later!)

**From your draft, you wrote:**  
> “I totally agree that govemments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights.”

That’s closer—but you can make it *even clearer* by saying **why** you agree.

---

#### Try This Structure:
Governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers because [Reason 1] and [Reason 2].

---

**Example (for inspiration, not for copying):**  
> Governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers because these laws guarantee fair working conditions and prevent exploitation.

---

**Your turn!**  
Based on your essay (talking about fair salary, working hours, protecting rights), write your thesis statement:

- Start: "**Governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers because...**"
- Finish: Give 2 clear reasons.

**Would you like to type your new thesis statement now?**  
*(I’m here to help and will give feedback right away!)*

*Time:* 2025-11-19T11:21:46.981Z

In this way wich the stricter lows the goverment enforced, the rights of the migrant workers are better protected

*Time:* 2025-11-19T11:26:52.987Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing this section. This is actually the **second body paragraph**, not the thesis statement in your introduction.

Let’s keep our focus on Step 1: **Revising your thesis statement**—this is one or two sentences, usually at the end of your introduction, explaining your main argument and giving your two main reasons.

---

## ⭐ Let’s try again — Write Your Thesis Statement

Please look at this prompt:
> Governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers because _________ and _________.

Think about your main points mentioned in your essay, for example:
- Fair working conditions (like safer workplaces, reasonable working hours, fair pay)
- Preventing unfair treatment (like exploitation, low salary, or being poorly treated)

---

**Here’s a simple example structure for you to follow (please do NOT copy; use your own ideas):**

> Governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers because it ensures fair working conditions and protects them from exploitation.

Now, please try writing your OWN clear thesis statement here!
