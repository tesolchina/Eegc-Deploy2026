# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The essay presents a clear stance on climate change and the role of individual action vs. government action (e.g., "I partly agree... citizens can still influence the government"), but ideas are basic and underdeveloped with limited evidence.
- Organization: 17/25 - Logical paragraphing (thesis, two body paragraphs, conclusion) but transitions and progression are uneven and some sentences interrupt coherence ("But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little...").
- Vocabulary: 17/25 - Vocabulary is adequate but repetitive and sometimes imprecise ("a vast of job opportunities," "not really enough"); some collocation errors.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 16/25 - Frequent grammar and phrasing errors that occasionally impede clarity (e.g., "so is not always working well," "nothing happen"), mostly simple sentence structures.
- **Original Essay Total: 68/100**

Evidence (quoted):
- Thesis / stance: "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government..."
- Example with weak grammar: "But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well."

#### Revised Essay Scores:
Note: The revised essay addresses a different topic (AI and employment) than the original (climate change). This topical mismatch is noted below as a missed opportunity.
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - Clear, assertive thesis and well-focused development on AI and employment (thesis: "While the rise of AI-powered automation sparks concern... this article argues... will ultimately lead to a net increase in global employment"). Uses company examples (BYD, Samsung) to illustrate points, though claims are sometimes general and would benefit from data.
- Organization: 23/25 - Strong structure with clear paragraphs and logical progression (thesis, sections on creation/oversight and strategy/analysis, conclusion). Headings improve clarity.
- Vocabulary: 22/25 - Precise, varied vocabulary appropriate to the topic ("AI architects," "machine learning engineers," "ethical integration"), few awkward phrases.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 23/25 - Mostly accurate grammar with complex sentences and varied structures; a professional register is maintained.
- **Revised Essay Total: 89/100**

Evidence (quoted):
- Thesis: "While the rise of AI-powered automation sparks concern over job displacement, this article argues that the technology's integration into industries will ultimately lead to a net increase in global employment..."
- Example of organization/purpose: "The development, deployment, and oversight of AI automation systems inherently generate a significant demand for a vast and diverse pool of human talent."

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +21 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis clarity and decisiveness: the revised essay opens with a clear, assertive thesis on AI and employment.
  - Organization and flow: the revised draft uses clear sectioning and logically develops two main supporting arguments.
  - Language precision and style: vocabulary and sentence structures are more varied and formal in the revised essay.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Topic continuity: the revised essay addresses a different topic (AI & employment) than the original (climate change). This raises concerns about whether the revision is of the same assignment.
  - Evidence and citation: both drafts rely on company examples without quantitative data or citations; stronger empirical support (statistics, sources) would make arguments more persuasive.
  - Engagement with counterarguments: the revised essay could more robustly acknowledge and rebut the strongest counterclaims (e.g., short-term displacement, sectoral job losses).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 7** (assistant and user messages combined)
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided structured, practical guidance focused on thesis revision and a three-step process. The student supplied the draft and answered prompts, but did not paste a revised thesis or demonstrate iterative revisions in the chat. There is guidance but limited visible student-led revision cycles.

Representative chat evidence:
- Assistant guidance on thesis: "Be direct and decisive... Preview the main reasons/points you will discuss (2–3 clear points)."
- Student pasted draft but did not follow up with a revised thesis: user message contains the draft; no subsequent revised thesis appears in the chat history.

#### Interaction Scores:
- In-Depth Conversation: 2/5 - The chat displays a basic, task-oriented interaction. There are helpful prompts from the assistant, but exchanges are few (7 messages total) and do not show extended, multi-level questioning or deep exploration.
  - Evidence: The assistant asked the student to paste a revised thesis and select a paragraph for Step 2, but the student did not proceed to paste a revision after the assistant's guidance.
- Critical Review of AI Suggestions: 2/5 - Limited critical evaluation of AI suggestions is visible. The student accepted guidance implicitly by following prompts, but there are no explicit instances where the student evaluated, rejected, or substantially adapted suggestions based on reasons.
  - Evidence: The assistant gave a checklist and "Concrete guidance"; the student did not post a revised thesis to demonstrate acceptance or modification.
- Refining Process: 2/5 - Minimal iterative refinement is shown. The assistant outlined a three-step revision process, but the chat lacks multiple meaningful revision cycles or tracked changes.
  - Evidence: After the assistant's instructions and tips, the student reposted the draft, but the conversation stops short of completed revision steps (no final student revisions appear in chat).

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 6/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear receptiveness to guidance: the student pasted the full draft and engaged with the assistant's structured coaching prompts.
- Good final product (revised essay) language quality: the revised essay (AI-assisted text) demonstrates improved organization, vocabulary, and grammar.
- Awareness of main argumentative moves: both drafts show awareness of supporting claims (e.g., need for technical talent, oversight roles).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Task consistency: ensure the revision applies to the same original essay topic. The original and revised essays differ in topic (climate change vs. AI employment), which undermines clear assessment of the student's revision work.
- Demonstrate iterative revision in chat: paste revised thesis/topic sentence/body paragraph in chat so the assistant and instructor can see the student's editing process and decision-making.
- Evidence and counterargument handling: include empirical data and engage explicitly with the strongest opposing claims to strengthen persuasion.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Needs Improvement - The student provided the draft but did not clearly specify course goals or which specific revision outputs were expected in the chat beyond pasting the thesis. Evidence: assistant repeatedly prompted for a revised thesis, which was not posted.
- Strategic Planning: Needs Improvement - The assistant proposed a clear three-step plan, but the student did not follow through to completion in the chat history.
- Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement - The student did not visibly critique or justify acceptance/rejection of AI suggestions in the chat.
- Independent Editing: Needs Improvement - No completed student revisions are shown in the chat (thesis/topic sentence/body paragraph revisions were not posted by the student), so independent editing cannot be verified.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Explicitly post each revision step in the chat (revised thesis, revised topic sentence, revised paragraph) so the iterative process is visible and assessable.
2. Add empirical evidence (statistics, reputable sources) and cite them to support claims—especially when making broad claims about employment trends.
3. Use the chat to critically evaluate AI suggestions: when the assistant proposes wording or structure, respond with acceptance, modification, or rejection and explain why.
4. Maintain topic continuity: ensure revisions correspond to the original essay prompt; if the topic is intentionally changed, note that clearly.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student did not complete the three requested revision tasks in the chat (no explicit revised thesis, topic sentence, or body paragraph posted). Therefore, per the initial instruction, the status is "not finished."
- There is a topical mismatch: the original essay is on climate change, but the "revised essay" text provided addresses AI and employment. Please confirm whether the student intended to switch prompts or if the revised essay is an unrelated example.
- Recommend requiring the student to submit the exact revision artifacts (thesis rewrite, one revised topic sentence, one revised paragraph) in the chat so the AI-assistant process and student decisions can be clearly evaluated.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
While the rise of AI-powered automation sparks concern over job displacement, this article argues that the technology's integration into industries will ultimately lead to a net increase in global employment by creating new, specialized, and high-value roles.
​The Creation and Oversight of AI Systems
​The development, deployment, and oversight of AI automation systems inherently generate a significant demand for a vast and diverse pool of human talent.  While AI automates routine tasks, the creation of the automation itself requires highly skilled AI architects, machine learning engineers, and data scientists. Furthermore, once deployed, these sophisticated systems require continuous monitoring, maintenance, and human intervention to resolve underlying issues, calibrate performance, and handle unexpected exceptions that the algorithm cannot process. The evidence from major international corporations like BYD speaks for itself. As BYD invests heavily in building its automation and robotics arms, it actively recruits a growing number of specialized talents—not to operate assembly lines, but to innovate the system's design and ensure its consistent, high-demand operation. This shift demonstrates that automation is not merely replacing jobs but is transforming roles into higher-skilled positions focused on system management and innovation, thereby enhancing the overall demand for qualified professionals and boosting the employment rate.
​Strategy and Analysis of AI Potential
​Beyond direct engineering, AI's complex nature creates new job categories centered on unlocking its full potential, interpreting its output, and strategizing its ethical integration into the business ecosystem. While AI is a powerful tool, we do not fully understand the boundaries or maximum potential of its systems. Companies need data analysts and AI strategists to study adoption trends, measure performance against business goals, and provide the best way to utilize and train the AI effectively. If its potential is mismanaged or misunderstood, an AI system could fail to deliver value or even be prematurely retired. For instance, major corporations such as Samsung hire experts specifically for data analysis and business intelligence related to their automation systems. These roles are essential for maximizing the system's ability and translating raw AI output into actionable business strategy. Therefore, even as some manual work is replaced, the demand for human expertise to interpret, strategize, and govern AI's capabilities ensures the formation of new, well-paying job opportunities. This transformation is not an exploitation of human jobs but a creation of new chances in a modern, data-driven economy.
​Conclusion
​In conclusion, the integration of AI-powered automation into global industries, while disruptive, promises to be a powerful catalyst for employment growth. The demand for AI engineers, system monitors, data strategists, and ethical oversight professionals directly related to building and managing this technology far outweighs the number of routine roles it replaces. This shift is elevating the skills required in the workforce and fostering new, dynamic sectors. The real-life examples of international companies continuously recruiting for these specialized talents demonstrate that AI is not leading to a decline, but rather a strategic evolution of global employment. Whether the rate of employment will soar remains to be seen, but the clear need for human intellect to design, govern, and maximize AI's potential strongly indicates that the long-term trend will be upward.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T08:37:31.895Z

**You:** In this day and age, the power of AI keeps skyrocketing thanks to its unprecedented efficiency brought to industries. However, some may concern that the use of AI may cause the drop of global employment in the long term. Therefore, this article aims to point out the reasons why the usage of AI will not lower the employment rate but only will let it soar.
  One of the predominant factors is that the AI automation requires large amounts of talents to generate and monitor it which also create a vast of job opportunities. Despite having the ability to boost efficiency, the automation system always has some underlying issues which requires humans to grapple with it. The evidence speaks for itself. The international corporations, BYD, always recruits the talent to help them to build the automation system and robotics arm. Talents are required to monitor the system which has a higher demand in their innovations and they need to be capable to address the issue from the system. By analyzing the real-life example from BYD, we can understand that there are only more and more people being recruited for the company. In other word, the employment rate would only enhance since more talents are needed for the industry.
  In addition, the automation system creates job opportunities as it requires the experts to analyze trend of adopting AI. As we know that, AI is smart and powerful but we do not totally understand the whole system of AI. Should we do not know the maximum potential of AI, we may make it shutting down and stop working for humans. In a bid to prevent this problem, we need some professionals to help us to discover the ability of AI and provide us the best way to utilize and train the AI. For instance, some company such as  Samsung hire experts for data analysis. The reason is that companies want to understand the potential of their automation system, so they need some experts to help them to know the ability of their system which create job opportunities for people. Albeit some works are replaced by AI, the AI automation demands experts to unlock its potential. Transforming industries is not exploiting the job opportunities of humans but creating more chances for humans. When more and more new industries are formed, more and more talents are required. Thus, the transforming industries due to AI automation will only raise the employment.
 All in all, the AI automation can boost the efficiency of an industry but it does not mean that humans will be replaced. Whether employment will enhance or undermine, time will answer.

**Assistant:** Great — I can help with the three-step revision process. First, which essay would you like to work on now: the climate-change essay or the AI-and-employment essay? 

Then please paste (or confirm) the thesis statement you want to revise. If you’d like, I can first give brief feedback on the thesis from either draft so you can choose.

*Time:* 2025-12-03T08:58:04.310Z

**You:** The title is automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. Does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term?

*Time:* 2025-12-03T09:02:07.801Z

**Assistant:** Excellent — we'll work on the AI-and-employment essay. First step: please paste your current thesis statement for this question:
"Does automation ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term?"

While you paste it, here are some quick, focused tips to shape a strong thesis (I won’t write the full sentence for you — I’ll guide you to revise it):

- Be direct and decisive: clearly state whether you agree that automation enhances, undermines, or has a mixed effect on long‑term employment.
- Preview the main reasons/points you will discuss (2–3 clear points). This helps the reader know the essay’s structure.
- Use confident, precise language (avoid “I think,” “maybe,” or vague qualifiers).
- Keep it specific enough to guide your body paragraphs but broad enough to cover the essay.

Checklist to use when you rewrite:
- Does the sentence directly answer the question?
- Does it preview the key arguments you will develop?
- Is the language confident and specific?
- Is it one clear sentence (or at most two closely linked sentences)?

Please paste your current thesis now. If you don’t have one yet, write a short attempt and I’ll give feedback so you can revise it. Once you’re happy with the revised thesis, we’ll move to Step 2 (you’ll pick a body paragraph to revise). Would you like to try revising your thesis now?

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for pasting your draft. Let’s start Step 1: thesis revision.

Quick feedback on your current thesis (the sentence that begins “Therefore, this article aims to point out…”):
- Strengths: You have a clear stance (you argue AI will raise employment) and you mention reasons (creation of talent needs, monitoring, data analysis).
- Problems to fix:
  - Tone and confidence: phrases like “aims to point out” and “will not lower… but only will let it soar” weaken the claim. Be direct and decisive.
  - Clarity and focus: the sentence is long and repeats ideas. It should be one clear claim with 2–3 previewed reasons.
  - Precision: avoid absolute words like “only… soar” unless you can fully support them. Use specific, defensible points instead.
  - Grammar/word choice: fix awkward constructions (“a vast of job opportunities,” “maybe just listen a little,” “we may make it shutting down”).

What your revised thesis must do (short checklist):
- Directly answer the question (state whether automation enhances/undermines/has mixed effects).
- Preview the main reasons or the structure of your essay (2–3 clear points).
- Use confident, precise language (no “I think,” “maybe,” “this article aims to…”).
- Keep it short—one clear sentence (or two tightly linked sentences).

Concrete guidance (not a full rewritten sentence):
- Choose a clear position word: e.g., “enhances,” “undermines,” or “has a mixed effect.” (You seem to argue “enhances.”)
- Identify 2–3 concise reasons to preview. Possible reasons from your essay: 
  - “creates new technical and maintenance jobs” 
  - “stimulates new industries and increases demand” 
  - “requires human oversight and upskilling”
- Combine in this structure: Claim + because + short list of reasons. (Don’t write “this article aims to…”)

Helpful word/phrase options you can use inside your thesis:
- “ultimately enhances long‑term employment prospects”
- “by creating new jobs in [technology/maintenance/etc.]”
- “by driving new industries and consumer demand”
- “by increasing demand for skilled workers and oversight”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using those pieces? Paste your new version and I’ll give focused feedback. Once you’re happy with the thesis, tell me which body paragraph you want to work on (paragraph 1, 2, or 3) and paste its current topic sentence so we can move to Step 2.
