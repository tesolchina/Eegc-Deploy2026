            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your work and the chat history. Here’s a brief summary to help you complete your training successfully:

---

### Summary of Current Status:

- You have made some good attempts revising your thesis statement, moving toward clearer and more confident language.
- However, your revised thesis is not yet finalized and you have not started revising topic sentences or body paragraphs.
- The chat focused mainly on the thesis statement, without extending to other parts of your essay.
- To complete the training successfully, you will need to:
  1. Finalize a clear, confident thesis statement that previews your two main points.
  2. Revise at least one topic sentence that supports the thesis.
  3. Revise at least one full body paragraph for clarity, coherence, and detail.

---

### Next Steps for You:

**1. Finalize the Thesis Statement**  
Consider one of these revised thesis statements or create a new one based on your essay's focus:  
- “While individual actions such as adopting personal green habits have some positive effects, the most impactful way individuals can address climate change is by influencing governments to enact strong environmental policies.”  
- “Individuals play a vital role in combating climate change primarily through political influence on government policy, while personal lifestyle changes, though less impactful, still contribute to environmental efforts.”

Please try writing your final thesis statement now, aiming for confident, clear phrasing that previews both ideas.

---

**2. Revise a Topic Sentence**  
Choose one body paragraph and rewrite its first sentence so it clearly connects to the thesis and previews the paragraph's main idea.

For example, for the paragraph about influencing government:  
- Original topic sentence: “The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”  
- Revised example: “One of the most effective roles individuals play in addressing climate change is through influencing government policies and political action.”

---

**3. Revise a Body Paragraph**  
Pick one paragraph from your essay and make improvements focusing on:  
- Clear topic sentences and supporting details  
- Coherence and flow of ideas  
- Correct grammar and appropriate word choice

---

If you like, share your revised thesis statement now, and I can give you feedback to confirm you’re ready to move on to topic and paragraph revisions.

---

### Helpful Tips for Your Revision Process:

- Be confident and direct in your thesis. Avoid “I think” and “I believe.”  
- Make sure each topic sentence clearly supports your thesis.  
- Use examples and explanations in your body paragraphs to support your points fully.  
- Review grammar and word choice carefully to improve clarity and professionalism.  
- Ask yourself why and how individual actions matter, especially compared to government and companies, to deepen your analysis.

---

You are making progress! When you’re ready, please share your final thesis statement or draft revisions for the topic sentence or paragraph. I’m here to help you with detailed feedback to complete your training successfully.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-13T01:48:04.942Z

**You:** I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T01:56:40.990Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s start with **Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**.

**Your current thesis statement is:**
> "I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

**Feedback:**
- Your thesis does share your viewpoint and recognizes both sides, which is good!
- It could be clearer about answering the essay question directly. The question is about how much individual actions matter in fighting climate change compared to government or company actions.
- Try to directly preview your main points (government influence and green habits).
- Avoid “I think” or “I believe” for stronger, more confident language.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does your thesis tell the reader exactly what the essay will argue?
- Can you make the comparison between individual actions and larger entities clearer?

**Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now?** Aim for a version that confidently summarizes both sides and hints at the structure—mentioning influencing government and making personal lifestyle changes. Let me know your revision, and we’ll look at it together!

*Time:* 2025-11-13T01:56:45.129Z

**You:** I believe can influence the government, but at the same time, personal green lifestyle choice

*Time:* 2025-11-13T02:03:04.376Z

**Assistant:** Nice start! You’re focusing on the two key ideas: citizen influence on government, and personal green lifestyle choices. Let’s make your thesis even stronger by:

- Removing “I believe”—so it sounds more confident and academic.
- Clarifying the comparison between individual actions and the actions of governments/companies.
- Previewing both main arguments for the essay.

Here’s a guiding prompt:
Try to answer: “To what extent do individual actions matter, compared to government and company actions, in fighting climate change?” and directly mention both influencing government and lifestyle choices.

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement now, using these suggestions? Remember to be confident, specific, and clear. Let me know your revision and we’ll review it together!

*Time:* 2025-11-13T02:03:06.822Z

**You:** I confirm citizens can influence the government, but at the same time, personal green lifestyle choices are less impactful than larger entities clearer like governments can make strong decisions for the environment

*Time:* 2025-11-13T02:05:33.657Z

**Assistant:** Good effort on your revision! You’ve made the comparison clearer and avoided personal language—good progress. Here are some small suggestions to make it even stronger:

- Try turning your thesis into a direct, confident statement (not “I confirm…”)  
- Use topic-specific words: “individual actions,” “government decisions,” “impact,” etc.
- Preview your two supporting points: influencing government, and personal lifestyle choices

Let’s focus your thesis.  
Some guiding questions:
- Do you clearly state which actions are more important for fighting climate change?
- Does the thesis hint at how both influencing government and making personal lifestyle changes matter?

You might try a version beginning with:  
“While personal green lifestyle choices have some positive effects, individual actions are most effective when they influence governments to enact strong environmental policies in the fight against climate change.”

Or, if you prefer, you could structure it like:  
“Individual actions, especially those that influence government decisions, play a crucial role in addressing climate change, while personal lifestyle changes, though less impactful, still contribute to the overall effort.”

Would you like to try revising your thesis statement again, making it confident, clear, and previewing both ideas? (You can use some of the phrases above if helpful, but put it in your own words.) Share your new thesis statement and I’ll check if you’re satisfied before we move to the next step!
