# Revision Documentation: Point-of-View Essay  
**Course:** LANG 0036 – English for Academic Purposes  
**Student:** [Your Name]

## Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision

**Original Thesis Statement:**  
> While, the essay will shows that Automation will enhance global employment prospects in the long term, because the belief of human's intelligence and the trend of the economic market.

**Revised Thesis Statement:**  
> Automation will enhance global employment prospects in the long run because people will adapt by developing new skills, and companies will create new jobs to meet market demands.

**Reflection:**  
I clarified my thesis by directly stating my position and specifying two reasons—adaptation through skill development and job creation driven by market demand. This helps readers understand my essay’s stance and roadmap.

---

## Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision (Body Paragraph 2)

**Original Topic Sentence:**  
> Furthermore, with the rapid development of science and technology, automation has become a central theme in both daily life and industrial progress.

**Revised Topic Sentence:**  
> Furthermore, market dynamics drive the advancement of automation to stimulate job creation across sectors such as technology, manufacturing, and services.

**Reflection:**  
I revised the topic sentence to explicitly connect to my thesis reason on market-driven job creation and clearly preview the paragraph’s main idea, strengthening paragraph unity.

---

## Step 3: Body Paragraph Revision (Body Paragraph 2)

**Original Paragraph:**  
> Furthermore, with the rapid development of science and technology, automation has become a central theme in both daily life and industrial progress. It represents technological advancement and reflects growing confidence in technical skills. At the same time, consumer demand for intelligent and efficient products is increasing. The market must employ more people to work and run for their products as well as factories. Which main purpose is to get the highest profit. So as a result, it's surely that the employment can only increase but not decrease according to our situation. Not matter what kinds of jobs , they can all find their positions and emake contributions to the society.

**Revised Paragraph:**  
> Furthermore, market dynamics drive the advancement of automation to stimulate job creation across sectors such as technology, manufacturing, and services. This occurs as consumer demand for intelligent and efficient products continues to grow. To meet these market expectations, companies must expand their workforce to develop, operate, and maintain increasingly sophisticated automated systems. For instance, the integration of service robots in retail and hospitality has not only created new roles in robot supervision and maintenance but also expanded opportunities in customer experience management and technical support. The primary goal for businesses remains profit maximization, which often necessitates hiring in emerging fields like data analysis, automation coordination, and AI system management. Therefore, rather than simply replacing human labor, automation reallocates and multiplies employment opportunities in response to evolving economic demands.

**Reflection:**  
I reorganized the paragraph to ensure all sentences support the revised topic sentence. I added clear examples and explained how market forces drive new employment opportunities, improving coherence and focus.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
In recent years, automation has become a widely debated topic. Some argue that the way automation is transforming industries will ultimately undermine global employment prospects. However, this essay will demonstrate that automation will enhance global employment prospects in the long run, owing to human ingenuity and the dynamics of the economic market.

Firstly, automation is a product of human intelligence, so there is no need to fear that it will completely replace human jobs. As technological advancements continue, various industries regularly introduce updated automated systems—whether in everyday consumer products or industrial applications. These systems still require human operation, management, and maintenance. For instance, service robots that use automation technology are developed by engineers, supervised by managers, and operated by employees in supermarkets or cafés. This shows that even as products and automation continue to evolve, people can adapt and find new roles that meet changing demands. Human creativity and flexibility ensure that automation does not render workers obsolete.

Furthermore, market dynamics drive the advancement of automation to stimulate job creation across sectors such as technology, manufacturing, and services. This occurs as consumer demand for intelligent and efficient products continues to grow. To meet these market expectations, companies must expand their workforce to develop, operate, and maintain increasingly sophisticated automated systems. For instance, the integration of service robots in retail and hospitality has not only created new roles in robot supervision and maintenance but also expanded opportunities in customer experience management and technical support. The primary goal for businesses remains profit maximization, which often necessitates hiring in emerging fields like data analysis, automation coordination, and AI system management. Therefore, rather than simply replacing human labor, automation reallocates and multiplies employment opportunities in response to evolving economic demands.

In conclusion, although automation may pose certain challenges, its benefits for employment are significant. By using automation tools critically and wisely, society can achieve substantial progress in the global job market and build a promising economic future.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-16T10:38:58.093Z

**You:** In recent years, Automation has become a debated issue . Some argue that Automation is transforming industries is undermining global employment prospects in the long term. While, the essay will shows that Auto- mation will enhance global employment prospects in the long term , because the belief of human's intelligence and the trend of the economic market.
Firstly, I think one reason is that Automation derive from human, so it needn't to be afraid that they will replace our jobs and we will lose our jobs. As we can see , every year, different electronic companies will update its new products whether we can see in our surroundigs or be used in industrial places. The new products need to be ran by different kinds of people , not only for the experts . For instance, the service robot used automatic technodlogy , it created by thescientists, protected by the managers and ran by the people who work in the surpermarkets or cafes. So, it explains that though products are updating, automation are enhancing, people still can use their open mind to find a suitble jobs for themselves. Automation is not perfect!
Next, I think with the rapid development of science and technology , it clearly shows a trend that automation will become a hot topic in life and study. Automation represents the improvement, it represents people are more confident about their technic skills, on the other hands, people 's need of the excellent intelligent objectives are increasing, in order to cater the people's need. The market must employ more people to work and run for their products as well as factories. Which main purpose is to get the highest profit . So as a result, it's surely that the employment can only increase but not decrease according to our situation. Not matter what kinds of jobs , they can all find their positions and emake contributions to the society.
Overall, though automation has some disadvantages, but it clearly shows that it still has more advantages than bad I think use automation tools more critically and wisely can have big progress in global employment market and we will have a bright prospect!

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s start your structured three-step revision process. We’ll work together through each stage so you can improve your essay for your “English for Academic Purposes” course. Here’s how we’ll begin:

---

**Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**

**Instructions:**  
Please copy and paste your current thesis statement here (the main sentence that expresses your essay’s position or argument).

Then, I’ll give you targeted feedback about how clear, strong, and focused it is, and guide you in rewriting it.  
Remember:  
- The thesis should directly answer the essay question.  
- It should briefly preview your main points.  
- Use confident, precise language (don’t say “I think” or “maybe”).

**Your current thesis statement (from your draft):**  

> While, the essay will shows that Auto- mation will enhance global employment prospects in the long term , because the belief of human's intelligence and the trend of the economic market.

---

**Feedback:**  
- The thesis is a bit unclear because “the belief of human’s intelligence and the trend of the economic market” isn’t specific enough.  
- Begin with a clear, direct answer: Do you agree/disagree that automation will undermine or enhance global employment prospects?  
- Preview the main reasons (what are the 2–3 arguments your essay will discuss?).  
- Avoid first-person (“I think”) for academic style, and use direct confident statements.

**Example guidance (Not a full rewrite!):**  
Try to start with: “Automation will enhance global employment prospects in the long term because…”  
Then list your reasons: e.g., “because it creates new job opportunities in technology and adapts to market demands.”

**Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now?**  
Share your revision when ready!

*Time:* 2025-11-16T10:55:26.333Z

**You:** I think my article provides examples to prove my point, which already illustrates the trend in a very specific way. I would like to ask how to revise it again?

*Time:* 2025-11-16T11:01:05.789Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely, your examples do help to illustrate your points—and that’s excellent! What we want to do with the thesis statement is make the main argument and the reasons as clear and explicit as possible **at the start of your essay.** This acts like a “map” for your reader.

Here’s a quick check you can use:

- Does the thesis answer the big question directly?  
- Does it give 2–3 reasons (not just mention “the trend” but say *what* that trend is or *why* it matters)?
- Does it avoid vague terms (“the belief of human’s intelligence”) and instead specify the ideas (for example, “humans will develop new skills” or “technology will create new job sectors”)?

**Let’s get practical:**  
Would you like to try restating your thesis by:
1. Directly stating your stance (automation will enhance global employment prospects?).
2. Listing the two main reasons you will discuss (try to use concrete terms).

**Here’s a starter:**  
“Automation will enhance global employment prospects in the long term because [reason one] and [reason two].”

You can fill in the brackets based on the arguments/examples you plan to use in your essay.

Would you like to give this a try now? Feel free to share your new thesis statement for feedback!

In conclusion, although automation may pose certain challenges, its benefits for employment are significant. By using automation tools critically and wisely, society can achieve substantial progress in the global job market and build a promising economic future.      How is this version?

*Time:* 2025-11-16T11:07:42.161Z

**Assistant:** **Great job! You’ve made real progress in clarifying your thesis statement and the essay’s focus. Let’s walk through your revised thesis to ensure it meets all the criteria:**

**Your revised thesis statement:**  
> However, this essay will demonstrate that automation will enhance global employment prospects in the long run, owing to human ingenuity and the dynamics of the economic market.

**Feedback & Suggestions:**

*Positives:*  
- You have a clear stance (“automation will enhance global employment prospects”).  
- It is confidently written without first-person phrasing—excellent.  
- You preview two reasons: “human ingenuity” and “dynamics of the economic market.”

*Suggestions for Further Improvement:*  
- **Make the reasons a bit more specific.** Instead of “human ingenuity,” can you name a skill or action (like “development of new skills” or “innovation”)?  
- “Dynamics of the economic market” could be more concrete—*how* does the market help employment? For example, “creation of new job sectors” or “rising demand for skilled workers.”
- To increase clarity, consider combining these ideas very briefly in the thesis sentence.

**A quick example of sharper, more specific thesis elements:**  
“—because people will adapt by developing new skills, and companies will create new jobs to meet market demands.”

**Would you like to revise your thesis statement to add more specificity?**  
You don’t have to rewrite the whole thing; just focus on clarifying *what* “human ingenuity” and “market dynamics” mean for employment.

**Let me know when you’re happy with your final thesis statement!**  
Once you confirm it, we’ll move to Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision.  
Would you like to try your revision now?

*Time:* 2025-11-16T11:07:47.919Z

**You:** We can proceed to step two now

*Time:* 2025-11-16T11:08:52.609Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! Since you’re ready, we’ll move on to **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**.

**Instructions:**
- Please choose one body paragraph from your essay that you’d like to focus on revising.  
- Copy and paste the current first sentence (the “topic sentence”) of that paragraph here.  
- I’ll review how well it connects to your newly revised thesis and give feedback.

**A quick reminder:**  
A strong topic sentence should:
- Clearly introduce the main idea of the paragraph.
- Tie directly back to one of your thesis reasons.
- Be specific and confident.

**Your options (from your draft):**

**Body Paragraph 1 topic sentence:**  
> The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

**Body Paragraph 2 topic sentence:**  
> On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.

**Which paragraph would you like to revise?**
- Please indicate “Paragraph 1” or “Paragraph 2,” and paste its topic sentence below.

Once you share your selection, I’ll provide feedback and help you make it even stronger!

*Time:* 2025-11-16T11:08:56.947Z

**You:** I would like to address the topic sentence of the second main paragraph:
"Furthermore, with the rapid development of science and technology, automation has become a central theme in both daily life and industrial progress." Do you have any further suggestions for modifying the content

*Time:* 2025-11-16T11:14:00.216Z

**Assistant:** Great choice! Focusing on your second body paragraph’s topic sentence is a strong step for aligning your essay’s structure with your thesis.

**Your Paragraph 2 Topic Sentence:**  
*"Furthermore, with the rapid development of science and technology, automation has become a central theme in both daily life and industrial progress."*

**Feedback:**

- **Strengths:**  
  - It introduces the idea of automation’s growing influence—good job connecting to the essay’s topic.
  - It signals a shift or a “next point” (with “furthermore”), which is helpful for cohesion.

- **Suggestions for Improvement:**  
  - It currently just states a fact—it doesn’t clearly connect to the specific reason from your thesis.  
  - Recall: Your thesis says job prospects will improve due to (1) people’s ability to adapt/develop new skills and (2) economic/market changes (e.g., creation of new jobs, demand for new skills).
  - The topic sentence for this paragraph should directly preview how automation’s growth affects job opportunities (e.g., by creating new jobs or requiring new skills).
  - Try to avoid too-general statements (like “central theme”) and instead be more precise: e.g., “The expansion of automation in industries is generating demand for new types of skilled workers.”

**Guiding Questions:**
- Is this paragraph about how new technology leads to new job types?
- Are you discussing how companies need workers to manage/develop automation?
- Or is it about the shift in skills needed for the future workforce?

**Sample Stem (just for inspiration):**
“Automation’s increasing role in industry is leading to the emergence of new professions that require advanced technical skills.”

Would you like to try revising your topic sentence so that it directly connects to your thesis and more specifically introduces the main idea of this paragraph?

**You:** Furthermore, market dynamics ensure that the advancement of automation directly stimulates job creation across multiple sectors.How is this version?

*Time:* 2025-11-16T11:15:58.825Z

**Assistant:** Nice work! Your revised topic sentence shows improvement in clarity and directness. Let’s evaluate it together:

**Your topic sentence:**  
> “Furthermore, market dynamics ensure that the advancement of automation directly stimulates job creation across multiple sectors.”

**Strengths:**  
- Clearly connects to your thesis reason about market dynamics and job creation.
- Uses confident, academic language (“ensure,” “stimulates job creation”).
- Specifies that automation’s advancement is the cause of new jobs.

**Suggestions for further improvement:**  
- If possible, mention what kind of jobs or sectors are affected, to add a bit more specificity.
- Consider replacing “ensure” with a slightly more precise verb, such as “support” or “drive,” unless you want to make a very strong claim.

**Example guidance (not a full rewrite!):**  
- You could add: “including technology, manufacturing, and services.”
- Or briefly preview the types of roles, e.g., “creating opportunities for specialists in robotics, data analysis, and automation maintenance.”

**Would you like to try a minor revision to add a concrete example of job sectors or roles?**

**You:** I just made some modifications again, and below is the version I have modified.Furthermore, market dynamics drive the advancement of automation to stimulate job creation across sectors such as technology, manufacturing, and services. This occurs as consumer demand for intelligent and efficient products continues to grow. To meet these market expectations, companies must expand their workforce to develop, operate, and maintain increasingly sophisticated automated systems. For instance, the integration of service robots in retail and hospitality has not only created new roles in robot supervision and maintenance but also expanded opportunities in customer experience management and technical support. The primary goal for businesses remains profit maximization, which often necessitates hiring in emerging fields like data analysis, automation coordination, and AI system management. Therefore, rather than simply replacing human labor, automation reallocates and multiplies employment opportunities in response to evolving economic demands.

**Assistant:** Excellent work! You’ve clearly improved both your topic sentence and the supporting sentences in your chosen paragraph. Let’s walk through your revision using the final step of our structured process—making sure your paragraph is unified, clear, and fully supports your refined topic sentence.

### Step 3: Paragraph Content Revision

#### Your revised body paragraph:
> Furthermore, market dynamics drive the advancement of automation to stimulate job creation across sectors such as technology, manufacturing, and services. This occurs as consumer demand for intelligent and efficient products continues to grow. To meet these market expectations, companies must expand their workforce to develop, operate, and maintain increasingly sophisticated automated systems. For instance, the integration of service robots in retail and hospitality has not only created new roles in robot supervision and maintenance but also expanded opportunities in customer experience management and technical support. The primary goal for businesses remains profit maximization, which often necessitates hiring in emerging fields like data analysis, automation coordination, and AI system management. Therefore, rather than simply replacing human labor, automation reallocates and multiplies employment opportunities in response to evolving economic demands.

#### Review and Guiding Questions:

**Strengths:**  
- All supporting sentences are closely related to your new topic sentence about market-driven job creation.
- You give both general (expanded workforce/technical roles) and specific examples (robot supervision, customer experience, data analysis).
- Your explanation clearly follows a cause-effect logic: automation grows → new technologies/roles emerge → demand for skilled workers increases.

**Suggestions for Small Improvements (if you wish to polish further):**
1. **Clarity:**   Consider clarifying the connection between “profit maximization” and “hiring in emerging fields”—for some readers, this link might need a touch more explanation.
   - *Example prompt for you to try revising:*  
     “How does maximizing profit directly lead to companies hiring more employees, instead of just automating more?”

2. **Unity and Focus:**  Double-check that every sentence relates directly to why automation increases—not simply shifts—employment opportunities.
   - *Prompt:*  
    “Do any of your examples just show jobs changing rather than new opportunities? Is there a sentence you want to adjust or clarify to highlight actual job growth?”

3. **Evidence and Expansion (optional):** You might briefly mention how the numbers or trends back up your claims.
   - *Prompt:*  
    “Could you add a phrase citing global data or a well-known report, such as those from the World Economic Forum or ILO, to support the idea that automation creates more jobs overall?”

**You:** In recent years, automation has become a widely debated topic. Some argue that the way automation is transforming industries will ultimately undermine global employment prospects. However, this essay will demonstrate that automation will enhance global employment prospects in the long run, owing to human ingenuity and the dynamics of the economic market.

Firstly, automation is a product of human intelligence, so there is no need to fear that it will completely replace human jobs. As technological advancements continue, various industries regularly introduce updated automated systems—whether in everyday consumer products or industrial applications. These systems still require human operation, management, and maintenance. For instance, service robots that use automation technology are developed by engineers, supervised by managers, and operated by employees in supermarkets or cafés. This shows that even as products and automation continue to evolve, people can adapt and find new roles that meet changing demands. Human creativity and flexibility ensure that automation does not render workers obsolete.

Furthermore, market dynamics drive the advancement of automation to stimulate job creation across sectors such as technology, manufacturing, and services. This occurs as consumer demand for intelligent and efficient products continues to grow. To meet these market expectations, companies must expand their workforce to develop, operate, and maintain increasingly sophisticated automated systems. For instance, the integration of service robots in retail and hospitality has not only created new roles in robot supervision and maintenance but also expanded opportunities in customer experience management and technical support. The primary goal for businesses remains profit maximization, which often necessitates hiring in emerging fields like data analysis, automation coordination, and AI system management. Therefore, rather than simply replacing human labor, automation reallocates and multiplies employment opportunities in response to evolving economic demands.

In conclusion, although automation may pose certain challenges, its benefits for employment are significant. By using automation tools critically and wisely, society can achieve substantial progress in the global job market and build a promising economic future.  This is my revised full text. What do you think of it and what progress has it made compared to the beginning?

*Time:* 2025-11-16T11:32:07.172Z
