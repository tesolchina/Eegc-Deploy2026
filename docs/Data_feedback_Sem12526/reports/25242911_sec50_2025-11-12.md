            ## Contribution Analysis

            You’re doing well by actively revising and seeking improvement! Here are clear, specific ways to strengthen your essay, especially the paragraph about individual actions, and your essay overall:

---

### 1. **Use More Formal, Academic Language**
Avoid informal words and phrases like:
- “this is problem” → “this presents a significant challenge”
- “lots of people” → “a large number of consumers”
- “do green things” → “adopt sustainable behaviors”
- “just want to do what is easy” → “face barriers such as convenience or lack of motivation”

Try to replace conversational phrases with precise, academic vocabulary to raise the overall tone.

---

### 2. **Make Clear Comparisons and Connections**
Your thesis and body paragraphs discuss two points:
- Individuals influencing government (more impactful)
- Personal green lifestyle choices (less impactful but still important)

Make sure topic sentences and supporting sentences explicitly reflect this comparison.

*Example revision of topic sentence:*  
“Although individual lifestyle changes have a limited impact, influencing government policies remains the most effective way for individuals to combat climate change.”

In the paragraph, clearly connect points back to this idea to maintain unity.

---

### 3. **Improve Logical Flow and Transitions**
Use academic transitions to show relationships between ideas, such as:  
“However,” “Nevertheless,” “Moreover,” “In addition,” “On the other hand,” etc.

Example:  
“However, these personal actions can still create positive social norms and influence market demand.”

This improves coherence and helps the reader follow your argument.

---

### 4. **Explain Why Examples Matter**
Don’t just list actions or effects—explain their significance clearly:

- Why does buying from green companies encourage sustainability?  
- How do personal choices influence companies and society?

Try expanding these points with phrases like:  
“Such consumer behavior signals a growing demand for eco-friendly products, incentivizing companies to adopt sustainable practices.”

---

### 5. **Address Barriers More Formally**
Rather than saying “people don’t care,” explain obstacles realistically:

- “Many individuals face barriers such as higher costs or convenience issues, which limit the adoption of greener lifestyles.”  
- “Widespread behavioral change is difficult to achieve without adequate support and incentives.”

This shows critical understanding and sophistication.

---

### 6. **Strengthen Your Conclusion**
Your conclusion can emphasize the collaborative effort needed, summarizing your argument:

*Example:*  
“In conclusion, while individual actions alone cannot solve climate change, they contribute meaningfully when combined with government policies. Therefore, coordinated efforts from individuals, governments, and companies are essential for effective environmental protection.”

---

### Next Steps for You
- Pick one or two sentences you'd like to improve based on these tips—replace informal phrases with academic ones, clarify reasoning, or add transitions.  
- Share your revised sentences with me, and I’ll help you polish them further.  
- Then revise your topic sentences similarly to reflect the stronger academic tone and clear comparison we talked about.  

Keep up the great work! Step-by-step improvements will build your confidence and writing quality. Would you like to start with revising one sentence from your paragraph about personal actions?

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges:** 19 (excluding system messages)
- **Conversation Quality:** The student engaged in a step-by-step guided revision process, responding to each prompt, but rarely provided fully reworked sentences or paragraphs. The AI provided detailed feedback and scaffolding, but student responses sometimes repeated previous wording with only minor modifications.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation:** 4/5 – Student participated in an extended exchange (over 15 messages), focusing on all major stages (thesis, topic sentence, body paragraph), but some repetition and lack of deep questioning reduced depth.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions:** 2/5 – Student generally accepted most feedback and guidance without explicitly questioning, rejecting, or discussing the reasoning behind suggested changes.
- **Refining Process:** 3/5 – Evidence of iteration in thesis and topic sentence revision, but limited revision for body paragraphs and the “rest of essay”; revisions were sometimes superficial rather than integrative.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 9/15**

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- **Engagement with AI Process:** The student followed a structured sequence (thesis → topic sentence → body paragraph) and applied some AI suggestions directly to their essay.
- **Willingness to Revise:** Attempts were made to revise each required component, often using AI feedback as a starting point.
- **Responsible Participation:** The student sought feedback (“what can I improve”) and submitted multiple attempts for review, indicating openness to learning.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- **Depth and Independence of Revision:** Many changes involved minor or surface-level edits (swapping words, basic paraphrase) rather than substantial rewriting or integration of feedback.
- **Academic Tone and Clarity:** Informal phrasing, vague references, and lack of confident, explicit academic language persisted after revision.
- **Critical Engagement with AI Suggestions:** The student seldom asked clarifying questions or justified their choices, missing opportunities for deeper reflection and ownership of the revision process.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision:** Good – Student responded to most explicit prompts but rarely elaborated independently on essay goals or context.
- **Strategic Planning:** Needs Improvement – The student followed the AI’s lead but did not proactively outline an overall revision plan or sequence.
- **Critical Evaluation:** Needs Improvement – Minimal evidence of challenging, questioning, or selectively choosing among AI suggestions.
- **Independent Editing:** Needs Improvement – Edits frequently consisted of minor changes rather than full, independent rewrites.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

1. **Essay Writing Skills:** Practice revising multiple levels of writing in each draft—thesis clarity, topic sentences, supporting details, transitions, and conclusion. Focus on using specific, academic vocabulary and reducing informal language.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills:** Proactively evaluate AI feedback, asking “why” and “how” suggestions help, and consider offering your own replacement sentences before seeking further guidance.
3. **Overall Improvement:** Challenge yourself to rework entire sentences or paragraphs rather than making minimal substitutions. Reflect after each suggestion: does the revised version really sound clearer and more academic? Seek a balance between accepting input and independently making decisions.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES

- **Task Completion:** Although the student engaged with all required revision steps (thesis, topic sentence, body paragraph), revisions for some steps were incomplete, minimal, or did not fully integrate AI feedback into substantive improvement—hence, the task is rated ‘not finished.’
- **Collaboration:** Student shows willingness to participate in scaffolded revision but still developing independence and critical engagement with AI as a revision partner.
- **Next Steps:** Encourage the student to: (1) practice rewriting in their own words; (2) ask deeper questions about AI feedback; (3) focus on integrating feedback at the level of overall argument, clarity, and tone in future revisions. More explicit modeling and formative feedback may be needed to build confidence and autonomy.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The top priority thing that individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

Additionally, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care as greener ways of living cost lot more, like buying green food need to pay 30% more, so this is a big problem, which government may put some fundings to the market which may help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T04:46:14.488Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T04:48:10.916Z

**Assistant:** Great, thank you for sharing your current thesis statement:

> "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Let’s review it together:

**Positive aspects:**
- You show your position (“partly agree”).
- You mention both major points: influencing government and personal green choices.
- The sentence is clear about your “balanced” opinion.

**Areas for improvement:**
- The phrase “I partly agree with this idea because I believe...” is a bit wordy and could be more direct.
- For academic writing, it’s usually better to avoid “I think” or “I believe”—state your view more confidently.
- Try to briefly preview the organization or order of your main points.
- Use confident language instead of “but at the same time, I also think...”

**Guiding questions:**
- What is the main thing you want the reader to learn from your essay?
- Does your thesis answer the whole essay question (“do individual actions matter compared to government/company actions?”)?
- Can you mention both your points in the order you plan to discuss them in the body?

**Would you like to try rewriting your thesis, making it more direct and confident, and clearly previewing your two main points?** Let me know, and I’m here to help with suggestions if you need them!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T04:48:18.907Z

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:00:52.586Z

**Assistant:** Excellent work taking that bold step! Before we move to the next stage, let’s check in on your revised thesis:

You wrote:  
> “The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”

**Let’s review:**

**Strengths:**
- Much more direct and clearly states “influencing the government” as the main point.

**What’s Missing or Can Be Improved:**
- The thesis now mostly presents only one main idea (about influencing the government).
- It doesn’t mention your other point about personal green habits or choices, which you discuss in your essay.
- We want the thesis to preview both of your body paragraph topics, in the order that you’ll discuss them.

**Next Step:**  
Would you like to try expanding your thesis so that it:
- Clearly states the importance of individuals influencing the government,  
- Also mentions that personal green choices have a role (even if smaller),
- And avoids “I think/believe”?

**Quick example of a structure you can try (but please use your own words!):**  
“While individual green lifestyle choices have some impact, the most significant contribution individuals can make to fighting climate change is by influencing governments to take stronger action.”

**Would you like to try revising your thesis to include both main ideas and preview the body of your essay?**

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:01:08.624Z

**You:** Revise thesis statement:I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:02:13.596Z

**Assistant:** Great effort! Your revised thesis is already much clearer and more focused than the original. Now, let’s refine it a little more so it:

- **Clearly previews both main points** (government influence and personal lifestyle choices),
- **Uses confident, academic language** (avoid “I believe” and “I think”),
- **Directly answers the essay question** about the relative importance of individual actions.

**Current thesis:**  
“I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.”

**Suggestions to consider:**

1. **Remove “I believe/I think”** — simply state the ideas directly.
2. **Explicitly show the comparison/contrast** between the roles.
3. **Preview the body paragraphs** (government influence + personal choices).

**Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now, using more direct wording and clearly mentioning both main points?**

If you’d like a guiding structure, here’s a possible frame (please adapt in your own words!):

> “Although personal green lifestyle choices have a limited impact, individuals play a crucial role in combating climate change by influencing governments to take stronger environmental action.”

Would you like to give your revised thesis a try using these tips, or is there a part you’d like specific help with before you rewrite?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:02:18.995Z

**You:** Citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:03:52.477Z

**Assistant:** Great job—it’s clear that you are working to make your thesis more direct and focused!

Let’s look at your revised thesis:

> Citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

**Strengths:**
- You present both main ideas: government influence and personal choices.
- Your view is fairly clear.

**Areas to improve before moving to the next step:**
- Still using phrases like “I also think”—let’s aim for a more confident, academic tone.
- Make the thesis more direct and avoid any “hedging” language.
- Try to clearly answer the essay’s question about the relative importance of individual actions vs. government/companies.

**Your thesis will be even stronger if it states both your points clearly and concisely, previewing your essay’s structure.**

**Would you like to try rewriting this thesis so that it:**
- Avoids “I think/I also think” statements,
- States each point confidently,
- Shows the relationship/contrast between government influence and personal choices.

*Tip: You can start with something like:*
> Although personal green lifestyle choices have a limited effect, the most significant way individuals can impact climate change is by influencing governments to take effective action.

**Would you like to try revising now? If you’d like, share your next attempt and I’ll give quick feedback before we move to the topic sentence revision!**

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:03:57.468Z

**You:** Revise topic sentencesThe most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:05:18.315Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic! Now we’re on **Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**.

You’ve chosen the first body paragraph—the topic sentence is:

> “The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”

Let’s see how it connects to your revised thesis (emphasizing both government influence and the secondary, but real, value of personal choices).

**Strengths:**
- It clearly states your main point for this paragraph.
- It signals the focus on government influence.

**Areas to Improve:**
- It could link more directly to your thesis by briefly reminding the reader of the comparison (that this is more significant than individual lifestyle changes).
- Consider using academic language—“the most important way” could be made more precise.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does your topic sentence show that, compared to personal lifestyle changes, influencing the government is the stronger impact?
- Is the connection between this idea and your thesis clear?

**Task:**  
Would you like to try revising your topic sentence to make the comparison clearer and to echo your thesis more directly?  
(If you’d like, I can give an example structure after you try!)

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:05:22.600Z

**You:** The top priority that individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:07:03.383Z

**Assistant:** Nice job sharing your revised topic sentence! Let’s review it with your thesis in mind:

> “The top priority that individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”

**Strengths:**
- You’re clearly stating the main idea for this paragraph.
- The phrase “top priority” highlights its importance.

**How to strengthen further:**
- The sentence structure could be a bit smoother.
- Try to make the comparison to personal lifestyle choices more clear, connecting it directly to the thesis (“…more than lifestyle changes,” etc.).
- Use confident, precise academic language (for example, “the most significant contribution…”).

**Guiding Questions:**
- Can you clarify why this is the “top priority” over other kinds of actions?
- Would you like to mention that this is more impactful compared to personal green habits or choices, just like your thesis says?

**Do you want to try adjusting your topic sentence now, making it:
- A little smoother,
- Explicit about the comparison,
- And echoing your thesis’s emphasis?**

Let me know if you’d like a hint or example structure, or feel free to share your next version!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:07:07.429Z

**You:** evise one body paragraph::
On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:10:18.616Z

**Assistant:** Great! You chose the body paragraph about individuals’ personal green choices.  
Let’s do Step 2: **Revise the topic sentence** for this paragraph.

Here’s the **current topic sentence**:  
> “On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.”

**Feedback:**

**Strengths:**
- It introduces the focus on personal, lifestyle-based actions.
- Phrases like “on the other hand” help show contrast with the previous paragraph.

**Areas to improve:**
- The connection to your thesis can be clearer. Right now, it just says individuals “can make small changes.” We want to say that these changes are less impactful than influencing government, but still have a role.
- It can be more confident and precise (avoid “can also make small changes”—maybe use “Although less impactful,” or “While less influential than changing government policy…”).
- Consider summarizing the role of personal action in relation to the bigger picture, as your thesis does.

**Guiding questions:**
- Does this sentence make it clear that personal lifestyle changes are your secondary point (useful, but less powerful)?
- Does it echo your thesis’s idea about the relative impact?

**Would you like to try rewriting this topic sentence using stronger academic language and making the comparison to government influence more explicit, as in your thesis?**  
Let me know if you’d like a hint—or go ahead and give it a try first!

*Time:* 2025-11-12T05:10:23.857Z

**Assistant:** Great work! Now we’re on **Step 3: Revising the Rest of the Chosen Paragraph** (the one about individuals’ personal green choices). Our goal is to make sure all the supporting sentences:

1. Clearly relate to your revised topic sentence (which should emphasize that individual lifestyle changes are valuable but less impactful than influencing government).
2. Show unity and logical flow.
3. Use precise academic vocabulary and avoid unnecessary repetition.

Let’s take this step by step.

---

**Guiding Questions:**

- Do all your examples (like recycling, using less water, etc.) actually show how individual actions can have some effect, even if smaller?
- Is it clear why these actions matter, even if they aren’t enough on their own?
- Are the problems with individual actions explained logically?
- Does each sentence flow smoothly into the next?
- Is there a sentence that could be clearer, stronger, or more detailed?

---

**Starting point (your revised topic sentence might be something like):**  
“While less influential than actions that change government policy, individual lifestyle choices such as recycling, reducing water use, or walking instead of driving can still play a valuable supporting role in addressing climate change.”

---

**Let’s look at your supporting sentences one by one:**

1. **“These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter.”**
    - Is there a way to specify *why* they matter, and *how* they help, even if their effect is smaller?
    - Does it clearly link back to your topic sentence/comparison?

2. **“If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products.”**
    - Good! This gives a concrete result. Could you use more precise academic language?  
    - Are “create a good example” and “send a message to companies” the main outcomes you want to emphasize?

3. **“For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit.”**
    - Strong use of a specific example—good.
    - Does the cause and effect make sense? Is it stated in the most academic way possible?

4. **“But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem.”**
    - Could this be more formal and clearly explain *why* this is a problem?

5. **“Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.”**
    - Can you clarify cause and effect? Is this the main reason personal actions, by themselves, have a limited effect?

**Suggestions for revision:**

- Make sure each supporting sentence connects logically to your new topic sentence.
- Use academic transitions (“However,” “Additionally,” “Nevertheless,” etc.) for coherence.
- Clarify reasoning: why these actions matter, and why their impact is limited without wider adoption.
- Replace informal phrases (like “this is problem” or “lots of people”) with academic wording (“this presents a significant challenge,” “a large portion of the population,” etc.).

**You:** Revise the rest of the essayRevise the rest of the essay:Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Fantastic progress so far! You’re showing great determination in working through the revision process. Let’s focus now on **Step 3: Revising the rest of your chosen paragraph**—the one about individual green lifestyle choices.

Here is your *current* paragraph for this section:

> On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

Let’s make SURE each part works well with your revised topic sentence (which should also state clearly that these actions are helpful but less powerful than government influence).

### Let’s review, line by line:

#### 1. “These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter.”
- **Does this connect to your revised topic sentence by clearly explaining why they “still matter”?**
- Could the reasoning be more specific (for example, “these actions, while small alone, can contribute to wider change when adopted by many”)?
- Would you like to try making this link a bit clearer?

#### 2. “If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products.”
- **Are the cause and effect clear here?**
- Would it help to be more academic and precise? ("demonstrates public support," "influences market trends," etc.)
- Can you make the 'good example' aspect more formal (“sets a social standard” or “influences social norms”)?

#### 3. “For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit.”
- **Is this example specific and linked to your previous points?**  
- Does it clearly show the connection between individual choices and business responses?
- Would you like to use more formal idioms or wording? (“a large number of consumers,” “companies are incentivized to adopt sustainable practices,” etc.)

#### 4. “But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem.”
- **How might you rephrase this for academic tone and clarity?**
- Could you explain *why* this is a problem (e.g., without widespread adoption, the impact is limited)?
- Do you want to mention *barriers* (like convenience, cost, or lack of awareness) instead of “don’t care”?

#### 5. “Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.”
- **Is it clear that this is the main limitation of individual action?**
- Would stating it like “without collective action, individual efforts have only a minor overall effect” work better?
- How will you tie this limitation back to your thesis and the contrast with governmental change?

**Encouragement:**  
You ARE making progress! Remember: your writing doesn’t need to be “perfect” all at once—each revision makes it clearer and more academic.

### Ready to try revising three or more of these sentences?
Or, is there one in particular you’d like to work on first? For example, would you like to rewrite the line about the “problem” with a more formal explanation, or make the example about companies and profits more academic?

Go ahead and post your revised sentences (either the whole paragraph or one by one if you prefer). I’ll give constructive feedback and help you fine-tune for academic style and clarity!

**Assistant:** You’re asking an excellent and important question: **“What can I improve?”**  
Let’s look at specific ways to make your “personal green choices” paragraph clearer, stronger, and more academic—without rewriting it for you, just guiding and suggesting.

---

## Key Areas to Improve

### 1. **Academic Tone and Vocabulary**
- Replace casual or informal phrases (like “this is problem,” “lots of people,” or “do green things”) with more precise, academic wording.
- Use topic-specific terms and varied vocabulary (e.g., “sustainable practices,” “consumer demand,” “environmental awareness,” “widespread adoption”).

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try replacing one informal phrase with a more academic expression?

---

### 2. **Logical Flow and Unity**
- Ensure each sentence clearly links to your topic sentence (about personal choices being less powerful, but still valuable).
- Use connecting words (“however,” “nevertheless,” “additionally,” etc.) to make ideas flow from one to the next.

**Prompt:**  
Can you add or revise a transition word in your paragraph to clarify the relationship between ideas?

---

### 3. **Support and Explanation**
- For each example, explain *why* it matters (e.g., why businesses respond to consumer choice, why one person’s change isn’t enough without many people).
- Expand a point where the reasoning is brief or unclear.

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try expanding one example, such as explaining “why” companies respond to customer choices?

---

### 4. **Barriers and Limitations**
- Instead of saying “people don’t care,” you could explain barriers: cost, convenience, awareness, or lack of motivation.
- State the challenge in a formal way (e.g., “widespread behavioral change is difficult to achieve,” rather than “people just want to do what is easy”).

**Prompt:**  
Is there a sentence about the barriers to personal action you’d like to rephrase for more formal clarity?

---

### 5. **Summary and Connection to Thesis**
- Make sure the last sentence/idea of the paragraph summarizes why personal actions are limited, and connect it back to the contrast with government influence, as you previewed in the thesis.

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try revising your closing sentence to connect the idea back to your thesis?

---

## EXAMPLES OF IMPROVEMENTS (to inspire, NOT to copy!):

- Instead of “this is a problem,” you could say:  
  “This presents a significant challenge to the effectiveness of individual environmental actions.”

- Instead of “lots of people,” try:  
  “A large number of consumers”

- Instead of “do green things,” use:  
  “adopt sustainable lifestyle habits”

---

## SUMMARY OF NEXT STEPS

**Choose one or two sentences you feel are weakest or most casual. Try to:**
- Make the language more academic
- Clarify the reasoning or explanation
- Use a transition for better flow

**Would you like to pick one sentence to improve and share your revision?**  
That way, I can help you review it and guide you to the next sentence. You’re doing well—let’s keep building your skills step by step!
