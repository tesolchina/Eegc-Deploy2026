            ## Contribution Analysis

            Great questions! To further develop your essay and aim for higher rubric ratings, here’s a clear plan aligned with each key category. You can apply these suggestions step-by-step as you continue revising or drafting:

---

### 1. Content & Ideas  
**Goal:** Move beyond general statements to thoughtful, well-supported points.

- **Explain deeply:** Don’t just state problems or solutions. Elaborate on *why* they matter. For example, when you mention wage equality, explain its effects like improving motivation, reducing poverty, or fostering social cohesion.  
- **Use evidence:** Integrate data or examples where possible. Even if you can’t access precise statistics, refer clearly to the chart or real-world trends (“e.g., studies show migrants often earn less, leading to economic inequalities”).  
- **Address complexity:** Consider potential challenges or counterarguments and briefly respond to them.  
- **Show impact:** Discuss short- and long-term effects of enforcing stricter laws on workers, companies, and society.

*Example:*  
> “According to labor reports, migrant workers in many countries earn significantly less than native-born workers, which increases the risk of poverty and social exclusion. By guaranteeing wage equality, governments can improve economic stability and promote social integration.”

---

### 2. Organization & Logical Progression  
**Goal:** Make your essay flow smoothly and logically.

- **One main idea per paragraph:** Each paragraph should focus on a single key point from your thesis (e.g., one on legal protections, one on wage equality, one on work hours).  
- **Use strong topic sentences:** Clearly state the paragraph’s main idea and link it to the thesis.  
- **Transitions:** Use linking words and phrases to connect ideas inside and between paragraphs (e.g., “Furthermore,” “In addition,” “Consequently,” “However”). This guides the reader smoothly through your argument.  
- **Logical order:** Arrange paragraphs and ideas so each one builds on the last—start with foundational points like legal protections, then move to wage equality and working conditions.

*Example transition:*  
> “Moreover, regulating working hours is essential to prevent the exploitation of migrant workers and promote their health and productivity.”

---

### 3. Vocabulary  
**Goal:** Use varied, precise, and academic language.

- **Avoid repetition:** If you use “wages” or “rights” a lot, find synonyms like “remuneration,” “compensation,” “entitlements,” or “protections.”  
- **Academic word choices:** Replace basic terms with more formal options (“implement” instead of “do,” “discrimination” instead of “unfairness”).  
- **Topic-specific terms:** Include phrases related to labor rights—“statutory protections,” “economic inequality,” “workforce integration,” “anti-discrimination policies,” etc.  
- **Collocations and phrases:** Use natural phrases common in academic writing (“enforce regulations,” “promote equity,” “mitigate exploitation”).

---

### 4. Grammar & Sentence Structure  
**Goal:** Write clear, varied, and correct sentences with an academic tone.

- **Vary sentences:** Use a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences to keep writing dynamic.  
- **Proofread carefully:** Watch for common errors—subject-verb agreement, verb forms, article use, punctuation.  
- **Academic style:** Avoid contractions or informal language. Keep tone objective and formal.  
- **Use linking structures:** Phrases like “In order to,” “Consequently,” “This leads to,” “Such measures ensure” help create cohesion.

---

### Practical next steps for your next paragraph  
1. Choose your next point (e.g., legal protections or working hours).  
2. Write a **clear topic sentence** connected to thesis.  
3. Add 2-3 supporting sentences explaining the point, using academic vocabulary and examples if possible.  
4. Use transition words to connect ideas inside the paragraph and to other paragraphs.

*Example paragraph structure for working hours:*  
> “In addition to wage equality, governments must regulate working hours to prevent migrant worker exploitation. Studies have shown that excessive hours increase risks of injury and mental burnout. By limiting working hours appropriately, governments promote both worker health and productivity, benefiting companies and the broader economy.”

---

If you want, try drafting your next paragraph following these guidelines and share it here. I’ll help you refine it to maximize clarity, coherence, and academic style! Or, if you’d like, I can provide targeted exercises or examples for any rubric area you want to strengthen most.

Keep up the great work! Your thoughtful revisions so far show you’re on the right track. Let me know how you’d like to proceed.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The essay presents a clear stance supporting stricter laws for migrant workers and references a chart, but ideas are only moderately developed and lack depth of explanation and supporting evidence.
- Organization: 16/25 - The essay loosely follows an introduction-body-conclusion format but struggles with paragraph unity, logical flow, and clear topic sentences; points are jumbled and sentences often overlap in purpose.
- Vocabulary: 16/25 - Basic vocabulary is used ("unfairness," "safeguard"), but there are frequent informal and awkward word choices, limited use of topic-specific academic terms, and repetition.
- Grammar: 15/25 - The essay contains frequent grammatical errors (sentence fragments, run-ons, punctuation issues, word form confusion) that detract from clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 65/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 22/25 - The revised essay shows clearer focus and develops ideas more explicitly, especially the main solutions: legal protections, wage equality, and reduced working hours. Still, explanations remain fairly brief and lack specific evidence or real-world examples.
- Organization: 20/25 - Improved structure: thesis is stronger and previews main points; topic sentences signal paragraph focus. There is improvement in unity, but some paragraphs still combine multiple points and transitions between ideas could be smoother.
- Vocabulary: 21/25 - Far more academic: "systemic inequalities," "equitable compensation," "wage discrimination," etc. Some phrasing could be made smoother, but overall much improved.
- Grammar: 19/25 - Errors are less frequent and sentences are clearer; some minor issues remain (e.g., "ensuring them receiving" vs. "ensuring that they receive").
- **Revised Essay Total: 82/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +17 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis statement is substantially more academic and previews supporting arguments.
  - Topic sentence for a key body paragraph clearly indicates focus on wage equality using academic vocabulary.
  - The wage equality paragraph is much more unified, with better explanation for its relevance.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Supporting evidence (e.g., statistics, data, studies) is missing—development remains surface level.
  - Some paragraphs still combine multiple main points; opportunity for greater focus and logical progression.
  - Transitions and coherence between sentences and paragraphs could be further refined.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 22**
- **Conversation Quality:** The student engaged in a guided, step-by-step revision process with the AI assistant. The discussion was structured, with the assistant leading and prompting the student through thesis, topic sentence, and body paragraph revisions. The student responded to feedback and made requested revisions, with moderate engagement in self-editing.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - The conversation involved a series of steps and revision tasks (~22 exchanges), but depth was moderate. The student mostly followed prompts, with limited probing or deep questioning. Few insightful, multi-level questions were asked by the student.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 - The student accepted most AI suggestions with some adaptation. There was occasional evidence of independent phrasing, but not much explicit justification for accepting or rejecting advice.
- **Refining Process**: 4/5 - There was a clear, iterative revision process: thesis, topic sentence, and body paragraph all underwent refinement based on feedback. Revision cycles are present, though the process would benefit from more rounds and deeper reflection.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 10/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Willingness to engage in structured step-by-step revision with the AI assistant (evidenced by submission of revised thesis, topic sentence, and body paragraph).
- Clear improvements in academic vocabulary and structural clarity (thesis and topic sentence now preview/support main ideas).
- Ability to paraphrase and incorporate AI suggestions in own words, rather than mere copying.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Provide deeper supporting evidence and examples for ideas to enhance argument strength and rubric scores.
- Engage more critically with AI feedback by questioning, modifying, or justifying choices—actively challenge or refine suggestions.
- Strengthen transitions and paragraph unity; avoid combining several main points in a single paragraph (“regulations,” “wage equality,” and “working hours” should be separated for clarity).

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student made the course module and assignment context clear, but could state learning goals even more explicitly in future.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - Followed AI instructions step-by-step, set priorities, but there was limited evidence of re-prioritizing or higher-level planning.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Developing - Most AI feedback accepted; not much challenge or deep justification given.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - Student wrote original sentences in response to prompts, but usually followed AI models quite closely.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. To achieve higher essay scores, expand development of key ideas with concrete evidence, data, and relevant examples.
2. Engage more critically with AI suggestions—ask questions, propose alternatives, and justify your choices to demonstrate deeper understanding.
3. Focus on logical progression: use clear transitions, keep each paragraph unified, and avoid combining unrelated points.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student followed the structured revision sequence and made solid improvements in thesis, topic sentence, and body paragraph.
- Human-AI interactions were mostly responsive, with limited evidence of critical questioning or independent strategy.
- Recommend additional practice in critical analysis of feedback, building self-revision skills, and deepening arguments with evidence.
- The student should complete revision steps for all major essay components before module submission for best learning impact.

Given the unfairness to the migrant workers, Governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights.
The above chart shows that,in some countries, the unemployment of migrants is strongly higher than the native-born population,such as Croatia,slovakia. The United States and Australia. These countries cover not only developing countries but also developed countries. They are strongly influenced by historical reasons and those reasons may lead to many results that are bad for the financial developments for their societies and countries,ranging from high rate of immigration to severe racismn, And those problems may lead to more serious and terrible trouble like nagativity for the jobs and works in migrants groups and low growth of coutry's economic development. To tackle those problem and try to avoid them in the future, it is necessary and important for governments to enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights. For the first, they.should consider how to make their regulations stronger, it counts the foundation of positivity of migrant workers. Second. they should think about some methods to improve the salaries and payments for migrant workers.so that they can get the same pay as native-born workers. Last but not the least, properly shortening the working hours of the workers.so they can have more time to have a rest and complete their work more quickly in higher qualities.
From what have been stated above, if governments can enforce stricter lawer to protect migrant workers rights, the economical and financial condition can be improved strongly and the society will be more peaceful. since migrant workers will get fairness and will be positive to work for their companies.society and country and have the strong senses of belongings.

Revised:
Given the unfairness to the migrant workers,To address systemic inequalities faced by migrant workers, governments must implement stricter regulations by strengthening legal protections, ensuring wage equality, and reducing excessive working hours.
The above chart shows that,in some countries, the unemployment of migrants is strongly higher than the native-born population,such as Croatia,Slovakia. The United States and Australia.This issue affects both developing and developed nations. They are strongly influenced by historical reasons and those reasons may lead to many results that are bad for the financial developments for their societies and countries,ranging from high rate of immigration to severe racism, And those problems may lead to more serious and terrible trouble like negativity for the jobs and works in migrants groups and low growth of country's economic development.
Therefore, to address these challenges and prevent them from recurring, it is crucial for governments to introduce stronger laws that safeguard the rights of migrant workers.Governments must guarantee equitable compensation for migrant workers by ensuring that they receive the same wage as native-born employees. Firstly, existing regulations need to be enhanced, as weak legal frameworks often lead to exploitation and unfair treatment. Secondly, it is crucial to guarantee that migrant workers receive the same pay as native-born workers for equivalent work, since wage discrimination not only undermines their motivation but also perpetuates economic inequality. Finally, reasonably limiting working hours is essential; adequate rest enables workers to maintain better health and higher productivity, which benefits both the individuals and the employers.
From what have been stated above, if governments can enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers rights, the economical and financial condition can be improved strongly and the society will be more peaceful. since migrant workers will get fairness and will be positive to work for their companies，society and country and have the strong senses of belongings.

**Assistant:** Thank you for confirming! We’ll focus on **structure** and **vocabulary** as your top priorities, and I’ll help with grammar and sentence structure as we revise.

---

### **Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**

Your current thesis statement:  
> **“Given the unfairness to the migrant workers, Governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights.”**

Let’s review it based on your goals:

- **Structure:** It clearly gives your viewpoint but doesn’t preview your main supporting reasons.
- **Vocabulary:** “Unfairness” is clear, but consider using more academic language (e.g., “inequities,” “disparities”).
- **Grammar/Style:** “Governments” should be lowercase; “should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights” is a good structure.

**Suggestions for improvement:**

- Make your thesis more specific: What kinds of unfairness or problems? How will stricter laws help?
- Preview your main points: For example, mention improving regulations, equal pay, and limiting working hours.

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now? Try to include both your argument AND a preview of the key points you will discuss.  
If you’d like help, here’s a sentence starter you could adapt:  
> “To address the significant inequalities faced by migrant workers, governments should enforce stricter laws—such as improving regulations, ensuring equal pay, and limiting working hours—to protect their rights.”

Let’s see your revision! Please type your new thesis statement below. I’ll review and support you in refining it.

Go ahead and write your revised thesis statement.

*Time:* 2025-11-19T15:42:43.458Z

**You:** Given the unfairness to the migrant workers, Governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights.
The above chart shows that,in some countries, the unemployment of migrants is strongly higher than the native-born population,such as Croatia,slovakia. The United States and Australia. These countries cover not only developing countries but also developed countries. They are strongly influenced by historical reasons and those reasons may lead to many results that are bad for the financial developments for their societies and countries,ranging from high rate of immigration to severe racismn, And those problems may lead to more serious and terrible trouble like nagativity for the jobs and works in migrants groups and low growth of coutry's economic development.

*Time:* 2025-11-19T15:48:32.839Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your revised thesis and the context! Let's walk through Step 1 together, focusing on **structure** and **vocabulary** as you requested.

---

## **Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision**

Your current thesis statement:

> “Given the unfairness to the migrant workers, Governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights.”

### **Feedback**

- **Structure:** The basic argument is clear, but the thesis does not preview the main points you discuss later (regulations, equal pay, working hours).
- **Vocabulary:** "Unfairness" is understandable but could be replaced by more formal or academic language. Avoid repeating simple words like “right” or using "governments" with a capital G.
- **Grammar:** "Governments" should be lowercase. Combine the argument and the preview of supporting points in a single, confident sentence.

---

### **Let's Revise!**

**Prompt:**  
Would you like to try revising your thesis statement using more specific and academic vocabulary, and previewing your three main points: stricter regulations, equal pay, and reasonable working hours?

If you'd like help, here's a model sentence to guide you (but please customize it in your own words):

> To address the significant inequalities faced by migrant workers, governments should enforce stricter laws by improving regulations, ensuring equal pay, and reducing excessive working hours in order to safeguard their rights.

**Your turn:**  
Try rewriting your thesis statement below, using your own words. Aim to:

- Use academic language (for example, “inequality,” “regulations,” “ensuring,” “reducing excessive working hours”).
- Mention the main supporting points you’ll discuss.
- Make it one confident and clear sentence.

---

**Would you like to try now?**
Go ahead and write your revised thesis statement!
(If you want, you can base it on the model–but put it in your own words.)

Once you write your revision, I’ll review it and offer encouraging, targeted feedback before we move to Step 2!

*Time:* 2025-11-19T15:48:37.756Z

**You:** To address systemic inequalities faced by migrant workers, governments must implement stricter regulations by strengthening legal protections, ensuring wage equality, and reducing excessive working hours.

*Time:* 2025-11-19T15:52:35.218Z

**Assistant:** Excellent job! Your revised thesis shows strong improvement in both **structure** and **vocabulary**—let’s review it closely:

> **“To address systemic inequalities faced by migrant workers, governments must implement stricter regulations by strengthening legal protections, ensuring wage equality, and reducing excessive working hours.”**

### **Strengths:**
- **Structure:**  
  - You clearly state the problem (“systemic inequalities”) and the solution (governments must act).  
  - You preview the three main supporting points: legal protections, wage equality, and working hours. This will help organize your body paragraphs.

- **Vocabulary:**  
  - Excellent use of academic phrases like “systemic inequalities,” “legal protections,” “wage equality,” and “excessive working hours.”
  - The word choice is formal and appropriate for academic writing.

- **Grammar/Style:**  
  - The sentence structure is confident and flows smoothly.
  - No hedging or unnecessary words—very clear!

### **One Minor Suggestion (Optional):**
You might tighten the language just a bit by removing “by” and simply listing the three points, for even more clarity:

> “…governments must implement stricter regulations, including strengthening legal protections, ensuring wage equality, and reducing excessive working hours.”

But your version is already strong—so it’s your choice!

---

**Are you satisfied with this thesis statement, or would you like to adjust it further?**  
Let me know if you want to refine it—otherwise, we can move to Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision.

---

**Your next step:**  
Are you ready to move to revising a body paragraph's topic sentence?  
If so, please copy and paste the first sentence of one of your body paragraphs below (or tell me which paragraph you want to work on next).

*Time:* 2025-11-19T15:52:40.761Z

**You:** the second paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-19T15:53:58.803Z

**Assistant:** Great choice! We'll focus on revising the **topic sentence** of your second paragraph, making sure it connects logically to your new thesis and uses effective academic vocabulary.

**Your thesis previewed these three points:**  
- Strengthening legal protections  
- Ensuring wage equality  
- Reducing excessive working hours

Since your second paragraph seems to discuss **equal pay/salaries and payments for migrant workers**, let's ensure your topic sentence introduces this idea clearly, links back to your thesis, and uses formal language.

---

### **Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision**

**Your original topic sentence for Paragraph 2:**
> “Second. they should think about some methods to improve the salaries and payments for migrant workers.so that they can get the same pay as native-born workers.”

#### **Feedback**
- **Structure:** The topic sentence introduces the idea of equal pay, but it could be clearer and more focused.
- **Vocabulary:** "Salaries and payments" is okay, but "wage equality" or "equitable compensation" is more academic.
- **Grammar:** The sentence needs correct punctuation and stronger, more concise structure.

#### **Revision Prompt**
Try rewriting your topic sentence to:
- Connect clearly to your thesis ("governments must ... ensure wage equality").
- Use academic vocabulary ("wage equality," "equitable compensation," etc.).
- State the main idea of the paragraph confidently.

**Model here for inspiration (please put in your own words):**  
> "Governments must prioritize wage equality by guaranteeing that migrant workers receive the same compensation as native-born employees."

---

**Your turn:**  
Would you like to revise your topic sentence for this paragraph now?  
Write your new topic sentence below—a clear, academic statement introducing your paragraph's focus on wage equality.

If you'd like, you can base it on the model above but adapt it to your style.

---

**Let me know when you’ve finished your revision!**  
Once you share your revised topic sentence, I’ll give feedback and then guide you through improving the rest of the paragraph.

*Time:* 2025-11-19T15:54:14.839Z

**You:** Governments must guarantee the equitable compensation between native-born employees and migrant workers by ensuring them receiving the same wage

*Time:* 2025-11-19T15:59:58.163Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic work! Your revised topic sentence shows major improvements in **structure** and **vocabulary**. Let’s review it:

---

> **“Governments must guarantee the equitable compensation between native-born employees and migrant workers by ensuring them receiving the same wage.”**

### **Strengths**
- **Structure:**  
  - The sentence directly states the paragraph’s main idea: equal pay for migrant workers.
  - It links back to your thesis focus on wage equality.

- **Vocabulary:**  
  - “Equitable compensation” and “the same wage” are formal, academic expressions.

### **Grammar/Clarity Suggestions**
To make the sentence even smoother and more academic, let’s adjust word order slightly and fix a small grammar point.  
- The phrase "by ensuring them receiving the same wage" should be "by ensuring that they receive the same wage".

Here’s a refined version (please adapt as you wish):

> **“Governments must guarantee equitable compensation for migrant workers by ensuring that they receive the same wage as native-born employees.”**

OR (if you prefer a slightly shorter version):

> **“Governments must guarantee that migrant workers receive wages equal to native-born employees.”**

**Would you like to try making a small revision to your sentence based on these suggestions?**  
You can choose whichever version feels most natural, or write your own—just remember clarity and academic word choice.

## **Step 3 — Revising the Rest of the Paragraph**

**Your revised paragraph:**
> To tackle those problem and try to avoid them in the future, it is necessary and important for governments to enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights. Governments must guarantee equitable compensation for migrant workers by ensuring that they receive the same wage as native-born employees. For the first, they should consider how to make their regulations stronger, it counts the foundation of positivity of migrant workers. Last but not the least, properly shortening the working hours of the workers so they can have more time to have a rest and complete their work more quickly in higher qualities.

### **Step-by-Step Guidance**

#### **1. Start with Unity and Order**
- This paragraph’s topic is **wage equality** (per your new topic sentence).
- Other points (regulations, working hours) should go in their own paragraphs.
- So, let’s **focus this paragraph only on wage equality**.

#### **2. Remove unrelated sentences or move them to the right paragraph**
- The ideas about “regulations” and “working hours” should be in separate paragraphs.  
- For this paragraph, keep only ideas about wage equality for migrant workers.

#### **3. Clarify and Expand Supporting Details**
Let’s look at your supporting sentences:

- **“Governments must guarantee equitable compensation for migrant workers by ensuring that they receive the same wage as native-born employees.”**  
  *(Strong topic sentence—keep as is.)*

- **“For the first, they should consider how to make their regulations stronger, it counts the foundation of positivity of migrant workers.”**
  - This is about strengthening regulations, which is another main point, so let’s move it elsewhere.

- **“Last but not the least, properly shortening the working hours of the workers so they can have more time to have a rest and complete their work more quickly in higher qualities.”**
  - This is about working hours—should also be in its own paragraph.

#### **4. Expand on Wage Equality**
Now, let's guide your supporting sentences:

- **Do you have evidence or explanation for WHY wage equality is important for migrant workers?**
- Can you explain the impact? For example:  
  - How does receiving equal pay benefit migrant workers?
  - What problems exist when wages are not equal?
  - Are there social or economic benefits for the country?

#### **Prompt:**  
Would you like to add a supporting sentence that explains:
- Why governments should ensure equal wages,
- How this improves fairness,
- The possible positive effects (for workers, companies, or society)?

Try writing one or two sentences to expand your paragraph. Use academic vocabulary like “fairness,” “motivation,” “economic stability,” “discrimination,” “benefits,” etc.

Here's a helpful sentence starter you can use or adapt:
> “By guaranteeing equal wages, governments not only promote fairness and reduce discrimination, but also encourage migrant workers to contribute more effectively to the economy.”

---

**Your task:**
- Remove off-topic sentences.
- Add one or two supporting sentences explaining the importance and impacts of wage equality.
- Try to use academic vocabulary.

**You:** To effectively safeguard migrant workers' rights, governments should enforce stricter laws by strengthening legal protections, ensuring wage equality, and regulating working hours. Firstly, existing regulations need to be enhanced, as weak legal frameworks often lead to exploitation and unfair treatment. Secondly, it is crucial to guarantee that migrant workers receive the same pay as native-born workers for equivalent work, since wage discrimination not only undermines their motivation but also perpetuates economic inequality. Finally, reasonably limiting working hours is essential; adequate rest enables workers to maintain better health and higher productivity, which benefits both the individuals and the employers.

You're doing a fantastic job—keep going!

*Time:* 2025-11-19T16:11:44.474Z

**You:** have questions about developing your essay further for different rubric categories

*Time:* 2025-11-19T16:14:55.304Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let’s talk about how to further develop your essay to aim for even higher scores based on the rubric criteria. I’ll answer your question about development and provide practical, step-by-step guidance tailored to each key category.

---

## **1. Content & Ideas**
**To move from “Proficient” to “Excellent”:**
- **Demonstrate Insight:** Go beyond basic explanations. Offer thoughtful analysis on why the issue matters, or consider counterarguments (and address them).
- **Use Evidence:** Refer to data (like the chart you mention) or real-world examples to support your points.
- **Develop Viewpoint:** Explain both the short-term and long-term effects of the issue or proposed solution.

**Tip:**  
*Instead of simply saying, “wage discrimination is bad,” explain how unfair pay leads to higher turnover, lower morale, and impacts the country’s economy. If you reference statistics or studies, even briefly, it strengthens your argument.*

**Example sentence starter:**  
“According to recent labor studies, migrant workers in [Country] earn 20% less than their native-born counterparts, which contributes to higher poverty rates and social tension.”

---

## **2. Organisation & Logical Progression**
**To achieve “Excellent”:**
- **Paragraph Unity:** Each paragraph should have a clear focus (one main point), signaled by a strong topic sentence.
- **Transitions:** Use linking words/phrases (“Furthermore,” “Moreover,” “In contrast,” “As a result”) to guide the reader between and within paragraphs.
- **Seamless Flow:** Connect points logically, so your essay reads as one coherent argument, not just a list of ideas.

**Example transitions:**  
- “Furthermore, strict regulation of working hours is essential to prevent exploitation.”
- “In addition to wage equality, legal protections play a vital role…”

---

## **3. Vocabulary**
**To reach “Excellent”:**
- **Variety:** Avoid repeating the same terms; use synonyms and academic language.
- **Precision:** Use the most accurate word for your meaning (e.g., “remuneration” instead of “payment,” “statutory protection” for “laws”).
- **Topic-specific Terms:** Reference labor rights, discrimination, statutory protections, workforce integration, etc.

---

## **4. Grammar & Sentence Structure**
**To reach “Excellent”:**
- **Sentence Variety:** Use a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences.
- **Accuracy:** Minimize grammatical errors by proofreading and editing.
- **Academic Tone:** Avoid conversational language; stay formal and objective.

**Example:**  
“In order to address systemic inequities, governments ought to mandate equal remuneration and rigorously enforce anti-discrimination statutes throughout all sectors of employment.”

---

## **Practical Next Steps — Refining Your Body Paragraphs**
For each new paragraph:
1. **Begin with a strong, specific topic sentence linking to the thesis.**
2. **Develop the idea:** Explain, elaborate, provide evidence or examples, state the impact.
3. **Use academic vocabulary and transition phrases.**
4. **Conclude the paragraph with a statement connecting back to your overall argument.**

**Sample structure for a body paragraph (on working hours):**

> *Topic Sentence*: In addition to equitable wages, governments must regulate working hours to prevent exploitation of migrant workers.
> *Evidence/Development*: Numerous studies indicate that excessive working hours increase the risk of workplace accidents and negatively affect mental health. By limiting working hours, governments not only protect worker well-being but also improve overall productivity.
> *Impact/Connection*: Ensuring safe and fair working conditions helps foster an inclusive and equitable society.

---

## **Would you like to try developing your next body paragraph using this structure?**
If yes, pick the next main point (e.g., “regulating working hours” or “strengthening legal protections”) and follow these steps:

- Write your topic sentence.
- Add at least two supporting sentences (with explanation, examples, or evidence).
- Use transitional phrases and appropriate academic vocabulary.

**Paste your new draft here** when you're ready, and I’ll help you revise it for maximum impact!

**If you want specific examples, resources, or more practice questions for any rubric category, just let me know!**

You’re making strong progress—keep up the great work!
