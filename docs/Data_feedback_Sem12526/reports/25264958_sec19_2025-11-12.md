            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for your efforts so far. Revising your thesis statement to clearly express your position and main points will strengthen your essay significantly.

Here is one example of a clearer, more complete thesis that you might consider as a model:

*"While individual actions alone cannot solve climate change, citizens play an important role by influencing government policies, and personal lifestyle changes, though less impactful, still contribute to environmental improvement."*

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement along these lines? You can focus on including both the influence of citizens on government and the importance of personal actions, stated confidently and clearly.

Feel free to share your next version, and I can help you refine it!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The essay demonstrates a generally clear understanding of the issue and covers relevant arguments for both individual and collective action, but lacks depth in analysis and supporting examples.
- Organization: 20/25 - The essay follows a logical structure (introduction-body-conclusion), but some ideas are not fully connected, and paragraphing could be tighter.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary is adequate but somewhat repetitive (“green,” “problem”), with limited topic-specific variety and several basic word choices.
- Grammar: 17/25 - There are some recurring grammatical errors (“so nothing happen,” “so is not always working well,” “it not really enough”), but overall meaning is communicated.
- **Original Essay Total: 76/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - No substantive changes made to content or ideas. Arguments remain generally clear, mostly restating the original.
- Organization: 20/25 - Organization is unchanged and still fairly logical, but coherence between and within paragraphs remains weak.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary level is the same as the original; no new word choices or varied expressions.
- Grammar: 17/25 - No correction or improvement of grammatical issues identified in the first draft.
- **Revised Essay Total: 76/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - No improvements observed in thesis, topic sentences, or body paragraphs.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The thesis was neither clarified nor revised to address required main points.
  - No attempt was made to revise topic sentences or improve body paragraph unity.
  - Persistent grammatical and vocabulary issues not addressed.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 5**
- **Conversation Quality: The chat shows the AI attempting to guide the student through revision of the thesis statement, but the student does not engage in revision or respond meaningfully beyond copying the original draft and offering an unrelated thesis.**

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 - The total number of exchanges is sparse, and little evidence of deep or insightful questioning is present.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 - The student does not evaluate, discuss, or respond to any AI suggestions for revising their thesis or other aspects of the essay.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 - There are no cycles of revision or evidence that feedback was used to update the essay.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 4/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student uploaded the essay and located the thesis at the AI’s prompt.
- There is basic engagement with the AI at the outset (copy-pasting as requested).
- The draft demonstrates an adequate understanding of the issues of individual vs. systemic action on climate change.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- The student did not revise the thesis statement despite guidance.
- No revisions were attempted on topic sentences or body paragraphs.
- The student did not engage in iterative, critical editing based on AI feedback.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student did not provide explanations, answer guiding questions, or clarify reasoning for revision choices.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - There was no stepwise plan or evidence of acting upon AI instructions.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student did not review or comment on AI input.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - No actual revisions to the essay were made based on collaborative discussion.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing Skills**: Proactively revise thesis statements and main body content as directed; focus on clarifying main points and supporting details.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills**: Respond directly to AI prompts, answer reflection questions, and attempt actual revisions according to feedback.
3. **Overall Improvement**: Approach collaboration as an active process—engage in multiple cycles of drafting, review, and editing to maximize learning benefits.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
The student has not demonstrated completion of the required revision steps (thesis, topic sentence, body paragraph). The AI attempted to scaffold the process, but the student did not take up revision tasks, nor did they ask clarifying questions or provide reasons for their choices. May benefit from a short session on engaging with AI writing platforms and understanding revision expectations, possibly with closer guidance or scaffolded checklists.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

**Assistant:** Great work so far! Let’s begin the three-step revision process.

**Step 1 – Revising the Thesis Statement**

First, please copy and paste your current thesis statement here. (It’s usually the sentence at the end of your introduction that gives your main answer and previews your main points.)

Then, we'll review and improve it together!

Could you share your current thesis statement?

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:52:45.868Z

**You:** I think climate change is a big problem for us to solve it .

*Time:* 2025-11-12T06:58:25.820Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement:  
"I think climate change is a big problem for us to solve it."

Let’s look at it together!

**Feedback:**
- The thesis should clearly answer the essay question (about individual vs. government/company roles in climate change).
- It should mention your main points or argument structure (for example, the role of citizens, governments, and personal actions).
- Try to use confident, precise language (avoid “I think”).
- This statement is a bit general and doesn’t give your specific viewpoint.

**Questions to guide your revision:**
- Do you partly agree, totally disagree, or fully agree with the idea that individual actions don’t matter much?
- What are your two main points about fighting climate change?  
  (e.g., Citizens can influence governments, and personal green choices still matter.)

**Let’s try:**  
How could you rewrite your thesis so it answers the question and tells the reader what your essay will focus on? Would you like to try now?
