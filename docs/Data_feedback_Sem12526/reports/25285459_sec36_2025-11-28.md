            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thanks for your response! To keep things focused, please pick two areas you want to improve most right now. For example:  

- Clarity of the main argument / thesis  
- Stronger preview of main points  
- More confident, academic tone (avoid hedging)  
- Vocabulary precision  
- Structure or logical progression  

Let me know your two priorities, and then you can try rewriting the thesis using this template:  
“Automation ultimately [enhances/undermines/transforms] global employment by [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3], but this outcome depends on [condition/policy].”  

Go ahead and give it a try with one or two versions! I’ll give quick feedback to help you refine it.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The essay presents a clear, balanced position (“automation has both good and bad effects, but in the long run, it can help global employment if we prepare for it.”). Ideas are relevant and supported with concrete examples (car factory robots, self-checkout). However, the argument is general and under‑developed: claims are not deeply explained and the thesis is hedged.
- Organization: 21/25 - Logical paragraph sequence (benefits → problems → solution → conclusion). Paragraphing is clear and progression is easy to follow. Transitions and previewing in the thesis are weak.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary is adequate and accurate but simple and repetitive (“help,” “can,” “make,” “jobs”). Limited use of topic-specific or precise academic terms (e.g., “labor displacement,” “reskilling,” “productivity gains”).
- Grammar: 22/25 - Sentences are generally accurate and clear; basic grammatical control and punctuation are strong. Structures are simple; more complex sentences and variety would improve academic tone.
- **Original Essay Total: 81/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 19/25 - The revised essay largely repeats the original content. The only visible change is an extraneous “bla bla ...” after the thesis, which does not strengthen the argument. No substantive development or clearer claim was added.
- Organization: 20/25 - Paragraph structure remains logical, but the revision did not add a stronger thesis preview or improved transitions; the “bla bla ...” insertion disrupts the opening paragraph slightly.
- Vocabulary: 17/25 - No meaningful vocabulary improvement; repetition remains and the filler text reduces perceived seriousness of the revision.
- Grammar: 21/25 - Grammar remains acceptable, but the revision introduced a non‑academic filler phrase (“bla bla ...”) that weakens tone.
- **Revised Essay Total: 77/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -4 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None substantive — the draft remains essentially unchanged aside from an inserted filler string.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Revise the thesis to remove hedging and preview main points (e.g., name the specific mechanisms by which automation affects employment).
  - Strengthen at least one topic sentence to better connect evidence to the thesis.
  - Deepen one body paragraph with more explanation, better linkage between example and claim, and more precise vocabulary (e.g., “reskilling,” “labor market polarization,” “productivity-led job creation”).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 6** (assistant message, user request, assistant planning message, user pasted thesis, assistant follow-up).
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided a clear, structured revision plan and diagnostic feedback. The student engaged minimally — asked to revise the thesis and pasted the original thesis back. There is no evidence the student tested a revised thesis, revised topic sentences, or revised a paragraph after the assistant’s guidance.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 - The chat is short and task-focused, but not extensive. The assistant provided a multi-step plan and diagnostics, yet the student did not engage in multiple rounds of substantive revision or questioning. Evidence: only a few turns, e.g., assistant’s plan and diagnostics (assistant: “Step 1 — Revise your thesis statement...”), then the student pasted the unmodified thesis.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 - The student did not demonstrate critical evaluation of suggestions. There is no evidence of accepting, rejecting, or justifying changes. The student returned the original thesis unchanged rather than proposing a revision or commenting on the assistant's templates.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 - No iterative revision cycle is visible. The assistant laid out three steps (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph revision), but the student completed none of these steps in the chat. Evidence: the revised essay file shows no substantive edits; chat ends without further student attempts.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 4/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear basic organization: the essay follows a logical progression (benefit → problem → solution).
- Use of concrete, relatable examples (car factory robots; self-checkout) that illustrate points.
- The AI assistant provided a clear, structured revision plan and diagnostic feedback that, if used, would support meaningful improvement.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Student engagement with the AI: student should attempt revisions suggested by the assistant (thesis rewrite, topic sentence change, paragraph revision) instead of reposting original text.
- Thesis strength: remove hedging (“In my opinion,” “can help”) and explicitly preview supporting points.
- Depth of development: expand examples with explanation about mechanisms, scale, and long‑term trends; add data or citations when possible.
- Tone and vocabulary: adopt more academic verbs and topic-specific terms; eliminate filler and informal text.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student gave the essay and asked to revise the thesis, but did not specify priorities or learning goals in the chat beyond that single request. Evidence: user wrote only “let's revise the thesis statement” and pasted the original thesis.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good (assistant provided clear plan), Student: Needs Improvement - the student did not follow the plan to perform the revisions.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - no evidence the student evaluated or critiqued the assistant’s suggestions.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - the revised file shows no substantive edits, indicating little independent revision after AI guidance.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise the thesis now using the assistant’s template and post 2–3 versions for quick feedback. Example template: “Automation ultimately [enhances/transforms/undermines] global employment by [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3]; however, this outcome depends on [policy/education].”
2. Choose one body paragraph and post a revised topic sentence that directly links the paragraph’s example to the thesis (e.g., link robots in car factories to net job creation via higher productivity and new skilled roles).
3. Conduct at least two revision cycles with the AI: propose a change, get feedback, and implement a second draft. Include specific targets (tone, vocabulary, evidence depth) and accept/reject reasons for AI suggestions.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The AI assistant followed a sound three-step revision protocol and gave diagnostic feedback suitable for this assignment.
- The student did not complete the requested revision steps in the chat and submitted a “revised” essay that is effectively unchanged (and includes a nonacademic filler “bla bla ...”). This indicates low engagement with the iterative revision process required by the module.
- Recommended instructor follow-up: ask the student to complete the three-step revision (thesis rewrite, topic sentence revision, paragraph revision) and resubmit the chat log showing at least one iteration of feedback and revision.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
**Essay: Does Automation Help or Hurt Global Employment in the Long Term?**

In recent years, automation has changed many industries. Machines and computers do more jobs that people used to do. Some people think this is good because companies can work faster and make more money. Others worry that automation will take away jobs and make it hard for people to find work. In my opinion, automation has both good and bad effects, but in the long run, it can help global employment if we prepare for it.

First of all, automation can make companies more efficient. For example, in car factories, robots can build cars faster and with fewer mistakes than humans. This helps companies save money and sell more products. When companies grow, they can also create new jobs in other areas, such as design, marketing, and maintenance. In this way, automation can give people new types of work.

However, automation can also cause problems. When machines take over simple jobs, many workers can lose their employment. For example, self-checkout machines in supermarkets mean fewer cashiers are needed. This can hurt people who do not have special skills or education. If they cannot find new jobs, they might have trouble supporting themselves and their families.

In the long term, I believe automation can help global employment, but only if people and governments work together. We need to invest in education and training, so workers can learn new skills for the jobs of the future. For example, people can learn how to fix robots or use computers. If we do this, workers can move into new jobs that automation creates.

In conclusion, automation is changing the way we work. It can make things better by increasing efficiency and creating new jobs. But it can also cause people to lose their jobs. To make sure automation helps everyone, we need to focus on education and training. If we do this, I think automation will improve global employment in the future.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-28T04:12:31.450Z

**You:** let's revise the thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-28T04:14:10.670Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for starting us off. Before we revise the thesis, let’s follow the plan so we work on the things you most want to improve.

1) Quick negotiation of targets
- What do you most want to improve in this session? (Pick one or two.)
  - Clarity of the main argument / thesis
  - Stronger preview of main points
  - More confident, academic tone (avoid hedging)
  - Vocabulary precision
  - Structure or logical progression
- Which two do you want us to focus on right now?

2) Short diagnostic feedback (based on the rubric categories)
- Content & Ideas (Thesis & Argument)
  - Strengths: You have a clear view that automation has both costs and benefits and that preparation matters.
  - Area to improve: The thesis is general and hedged (“In my opinion,” “can help … if we prepare for it”). It doesn’t clearly state whether automation ultimately enhances or undermines employment, nor does it preview the main reasons.
  - Rubric estimate: Developing (3).

- Organisation & Logical Progression
  - Strengths: Paragraphs are clear and logically ordered (cause → problem → solution).
  - Area to improve: Transitions are basic; previewing in your thesis would make the essay’s structure easier to follow.
  - Rubric estimate: Proficient (4).

- Evidence & Development
  - Strengths: Uses concrete examples (car robots, self-checkout).
  - Area to improve: Examples are brief and need more explanation about how they support the argument or connect to long-term trends.
  - Rubric estimate: Developing (3).

- Vocabulary & Grammar
  - Strengths: Grammar is generally correct and sentences are clear.
  - Area to improve: Repetitive language and some hedging weaken academic tone. More precise verbs and topic-specific terms would help.
  - Rubric estimate: Developing (3).

3) Choose priorities
- From the diagnosis above, which issues do you want us to focus on during this revision? (Please confirm — e.g., “Thesis clarity and preview of main points” or “Thesis and academic tone.”)

Once you confirm the targets, we’ll move to Step 1.

Step 1 — Thesis statement revision (ready when you are)
- Please confirm your selected targets. Then share the thesis you want to revise — or I can copy the one from your draft:
  Current thesis: “In my opinion, automation has both good and bad effects, but in the long run, it can help global employment if we prepare for it.”

- Quick feedback on that sentence:
  - Remove “In my opinion” — the essay voice should be confident and direct.
  - Replace vague verbs like “can help” with a clearer position: does it “enhance,” “undermine,” or “transform” global employment?
  - Preview the main reasons or conditions you will discuss (for example: productivity and new high‑skill jobs; displacement of low‑skill work; the role of education and policy).
  - If you want a structure: a strong thesis answers the question directly and lists 2–3 main points you will develop.

- A template you can use (fill the blanks):
  - “Automation ultimately [enhances/undermines/transforms] global employment by [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3]; however, this outcome depends on [condition/policy].”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using that template? I’ll give quick feedback on your attempt. If you prefer, I can show one short model thesis after you try.

**You:** In my opinion, automation has both good and bad effects, but in the long run, it can help global employment if we prepare for it.

*Time:* 2025-11-28T04:14:44.381Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for that clear draft. First, a quick negotiation so we focus the session where you want it most.

1) Choose two targets (pick from these)
- Clarity of the main argument / thesis
- Stronger preview of main points
- More confident, academic tone (avoid hedging)
- Vocabulary precision
- Structure or logical progression

Which two would you like us to work on now?

2) Short diagnostic summary (quick)
- Thesis & Argument: You state a balanced view, but the thesis is hedged and doesn’t clearly answer the question or preview your main reasons. (Rubric: Developing)
- Organisation: Paragraph order is logical and clear, but the thesis should preview the structure to guide the reader. (Rubric: Proficient)
- Evidence & Development: Good concrete examples, but they need clearer links to the long‑term claim. (Rubric: Developing)
- Language: Generally correct but repetitive and hedged; use stronger verbs and a more academic tone. (Rubric: Developing)

3) Confirm priorities
Please confirm the two targets you chose (for example: “Thesis clarity and preview of main points” or “Thesis and academic tone”). Once you confirm, we’ll move to Step 1.

Step 1 — Thesis revision (ready when you are)
- Current thesis you gave: “In my opinion, automation has both good and bad effects, but in the long run, it can help global employment if we prepare for it.”
- Quick focused feedback:
  - Remove “In my opinion.”
  - Replace weak phrasing (“can help”) with a clear claim (e.g., “enhances,” “transforms,” or “undermines”).
  - Preview 2–3 main reasons you will develop (e.g., increased productivity and new high‑skill jobs; displacement of low‑skill work; the need for education and policy).
  - Use confident, concise language.

- Helpful template:
  “Automation ultimately [enhances/undermines/transforms] global employment by [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3], but this outcome depends on [condition/policy].”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using that template? Try one or two versions and I’ll give quick feedback. If you prefer, I can show a short model after your attempt.
