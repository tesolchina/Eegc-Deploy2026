            ## Contribution Analysis

            It looks like your essay repeatedly discusses automation and AI’s impact on employment, but your assigned prompt concerns migrant worker exploitation and whether governments should enforce stricter laws. Because the content is off-topic, revising the current essay directly will not fully meet your assignment requirements.

To best support your success, I recommend we first:
1. Clarify the actual essay prompt you must address (migrant workers? climate change? automation?).
2. Set focused revision targets aligned to that prompt.
3. Work step-by-step—starting with a thesis statement that clearly answers the prompt.
4. Then revise topic sentences and relevant paragraphs to build aligned, evidence-based arguments.

If your assignment is about migrant workers and labor protections, I can help you craft a new thesis and outline based on that topic, then guide you in rewriting the essay accordingly.

If you want, please confirm:
- Your actual essay prompt (please paste it exactly if you have it).
- Your two top revision targets (e.g., thesis clarity, organization, vocabulary).
- Your stance on the prompt (agree, disagree, partial), with 2-3 main reasons.

Once you share these, I’ll help you draft a focused thesis statement and revise your essay with clear, relevant content.

Would you like to proceed with this approach to create an on-topic, high-quality essay?

            # STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 11/25 - The essay discusses automation and AI’s impact on employment, which does not address the climate-change prompt in this module. The central claim (“global employment prospects may ultimately improve in the long term”) is off-topic and lacks specific evidence.
- Organization: 17/25 - Clear paragraphing with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. Ideas progress from benefits to drawbacks and a balancing conclusion, but there is no logical development toward the climate-change question.
- Vocabulary: 17/25 - General academic vocabulary is adequate (“reshaping,” “productivity,” “harmonious balance”), but climate-related terms are missing.
- Grammar: 18/25 - Mostly accurate sentence structure with occasional awkward phrasing (“Under this background,” “finish large volumes of work quickly”) but overall readable.
- **Original Essay Total: 63/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 12/25 - Content remains off-topic for the climate-change module. The thesis is slightly sharpened (“I believe global employment prospects may ultimately improve in the long term”), but there is still no climate-related focus or evidence.
- Organization: 19/25 - Improved coherence and paragraph transitions. Topic sentences are more precise (e.g., “It is widely recognized that the use of AI will become increasingly common.”), and conclusion strengthens cohesion by restating a balanced stance.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - More precise and varied word choice (“transformative,” “leverage,” “displacement,” “inclusive growth”) improves clarity and tone.
- Grammar: 20/25 - Fewer awkward collocations and better control of complex sentences (e.g., “AI is capable of performing difficult or large-scale tasks more quickly and accurately than humans…”).
- **Revised Essay Total: 71/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +8 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis sentence refined for clarity and stance (“Against this backdrop, I believe…”).
  - Topic sentences and transitions strengthened for smoother flow.
  - Vocabulary upgraded to a more academic, confident register; grammar and sentence control improved.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The essay remains off-topic for the climate-change prompt and does not engage with climate issues, evidence, or viewpoint as required by the module.
  - Lacks concrete examples, data, or references to policies, emissions, or mitigation/adaptation strategies relevant to climate change.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 15**
- **Conversation Quality: The assistant repeatedly requested goal-setting, stance, and reasons to guide a thesis revision aligned to a prompt, but the student repeatedly asked for direct edits and reposted the automation essay. The assistant also introduced conflicting assignment topics (climate change vs. migrant workers), creating confusion. No meaningful iterative revision occurred within the chat.**

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 - Although there are many messages, the exchanges lack depth. The student did not engage with the assistant’s diagnostic questions or provide a stance and reasons; the conversation remained stuck at preliminary steps.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 - The student did not evaluate, accept, or reject AI suggestions; they repeatedly asked for direct editing and did not respond to prompts for stance or targets.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 - No clear iterative revision occurred within the chat. The “revised” essay appears improved but was not refined through documented steps in the chat.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 4/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clearer thesis wording and more confident tone in the revised essay (“I believe global employment prospects may ultimately improve…”).
- Improved organization and transitions, with stronger topic sentences and a more cohesive conclusion.
- Enhanced vocabulary and sentence variety, producing a more formal academic register.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Align content with the climate-change prompt: Articulate a stance on individual actions vs. governments/corporations in combating climate change and support it with climate-specific evidence.
- Provide specific, relevant examples: Use data (emissions, policy outcomes), mechanisms (regulation, market signals), and terms (mitigation, decarbonization, carbon footprint).
- Engage in structured collaboration: Respond to AI questions (stance, reasons), perform the requested steps (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph refinement), and iterate based on feedback.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student did not share assignment goals, stance, or reasons despite multiple prompts; the AI also introduced inconsistent prompts.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The student did not select targets (A/B/C) or follow the three-step revision process; requests focused on direct editing without plan.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - No evidence of assessing or questioning AI suggestions.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - While the essay was revised outside the chat, the student did not demonstrate step-by-step independent editing within the collaboration framework.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. For essay writing: Rewrite the thesis to directly answer the climate-change prompt (stance + 2–3 reasons), then revise topic sentences and one body paragraph to align tightly with that thesis. Include climate-specific evidence (e.g., how consumer behavior shifts demand, how policies drive large-scale emissions cuts).
2. For AI collaboration: Start each session by confirming the assignment prompt, selecting targets (e.g., thesis clarity, organization), stating your stance and reasons, and responding to the assistant’s questions. Ask for examples and justify why you accept or reject suggestions.
3. Overall improvement: Develop a brief outline before drafting (thesis + 3 topic sentences + 2–3 supporting details per paragraph). Use climate terminology accurately (mitigation, adaptation, decarbonization), and add concrete data or case studies to strengthen arguments.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The chat shows prompt misalignment: the assistant alternated between a climate-change prompt and a migrant-worker prompt, which likely confused the student. Consider standardizing the session by requiring the student to paste the official prompt at the start and the assistant to confirm it before proceeding.
- The student needs guided practice in the structured revision workflow (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) with explicit checkpoints; a short, graded exercise on stance statements and topic sentence alignment may help.
- Despite off-topic content, the student’s language control and organization improved, indicating readiness to produce stronger work once prompt alignment and evidence use are addressed.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Automation is one of the most important forces in modern times, and like a coin, it has two sides. With the development of high technology, AI is entering and reshaping various industries, and people must face the rise of tools like AI. Under this background, global employment prospects may ultimately improve in the long term.

As we all know, the use of AI will become increasingly common. Enterprises will try to adopt AI and automated systems to raise their work standards and productivity. In this process, the number of certain jobs may decrease. However, over time, people will learn how to use AI to solve more complex and comprehensive problems. Technological shifts can improve people’s abilities in specific areas. From a global perspective, employment will continue to evolve in the future.

It is also true that automation can reduce motivation and contribute to job losses. At first, automation may not be implemented efficiently, so people may struggle to find a positive way to maintain morale. AI, as a smarter tool, can handle difficult tasks that humans may not perform well, and it can finish large volumes of work quickly. As a result, some basic jobs may no longer be necessary for human workers. From an individual point of view, technological change may seem harmful because it can lead to more unemployment.

The development of industry, society, and countries will always face various problems. But progress is constant, and we cannot stop the rise of technology. Therefore, we need to explore the best ways to avoid the worst outcomes.

Automation can undoubtedly improve efficiency; meanwhile, we must not lose confidence. People need to find a harmonious balance between automation and tradition.

Revised:
Automation is one of the most transformative forces of our time, and like a coin, it has two sides. With the rapid advancement of technology, AI is entering and reshaping various industries, requiring people to adapt to the rise of intelligent tools. Against this backdrop, I believe global employment prospects may ultimately improve in the long term.

It is widely recognized that the use of AI will become increasingly common. Companies are adopting AI and automated systems to enhance efficiency and productivity. While this may reduce the number of certain jobs initially, over time, people will learn to leverage AI to tackle more complex and comprehensive challenges. Technological shifts have the potential to elevate human capabilities in specific fields. From a global perspective, employment is likely to continue evolving in response to these changes.

That said, it is also true that automation can lead to job displacement and diminished motivation among workers. In the early stages, automation may not be implemented smoothly, which can make it difficult for employees to stay positive. As a smarter tool, AI is capable of performing difficult or large-scale tasks more quickly and accurately than humans, making some routine jobs unnecessary. From an individual standpoint, such technological changes may appear harmful, as they can contribute to unemployment in the short term.

Nevertheless, the development of industries, societies, and nations always involves overcoming challenges. Progress is constant, and it is not feasible to halt technological advancement. Therefore, the focus should be on finding the best strategies to mitigate negative outcomes.

In conclusion, while automation undoubtedly boosts efficiency, we must not lose confidence in human adaptability. It is essential to strike a harmonious balance between automation and traditional work methods to ensure sustainable and inclusive growth.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-26T18:17:35.522Z

**You:** Revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-26T18:39:46.105Z

**Assistant:** Great to meet you. I’m here to help you revise in a structured, supportive way. Before we start the three-step workflow, let’s negotiate clear targets and diagnose your draft so we focus on what will help you most.

Preliminary Stage — Negotiating Targets and Diagnosing the Essay

1) Your goals
- Which improvements matter most to you right now? For example:
  - Clarity and a strong viewpoint
  - Argument strength and logical flow
  - Structure and paragraphing
  - Vocabulary (more precise, academic terms)
  - Grammar and sentence control
  - Style (more confident, formal academic tone)
Please tell me your top two priorities.

2) Diagnostic feedback (based on your current draft and course rubric)
Note: Your draft discusses automation and AI’s impact on jobs, but your assignment topic is about climate change and whether individual actions are significant compared to governments and corporations. So the content is off-topic. That mismatch strongly affects your scores.

- Content and Ideas: 1 (Limited)
  - The ideas are mostly unrelated to the climate-change question. There is no clear viewpoint answering the prompt.

- Organisation and Logical Progression: 1–2 (Limited–Basic)
  - Paragraphing and logical flow are unclear. Ideas feel disjointed and not developed toward a central claim.

- Vocabulary: 1 (Limited)
  - Many inaccurate words; topic-specific climate terms are missing.

- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 1 (Limited)
  - Frequent grammatical errors and confusing sentences make meaning hard to follow.

Strengths to build on:
- You are trying to discuss a complex issue about technology and society.
- You aim to consider global perspectives and long-term effects, which is valuable in academic writing when aligned to the topic.

3) Your priority selection
- Given the assignment, I recommend we focus on:
  - Target A: Thesis clarity and direct relevance to the climate-change prompt.
  - Target B: Organisation (clear topic sentences and logical progression).
  - If you want, we can add Target C: Grammar—especially sentence control.
Please choose the two targets you most want to work on (A, B, or C). Once you confirm, we’ll begin Step 1.

To prepare for Step 1 (Thesis Revision), please also tell me:
- Your stance on the prompt: Do you agree, disagree, or partially agree with “individual actions are insignificant compared to governments/corporations in fighting climate change”?
- The 2–3 main reasons you want to use to support your stance (for example: scale of impact, policy leverage, consumer behavior, cultural norms, political participation, technological adoption, etc.).

When you reply:
- Confirm your two targets (e.g., “A and B”).
- Share your current thesis idea in one sentence that answers the question and previews your main points.
- After we revise the thesis, we’ll pick one body paragraph to work on next. If you already have a paragraph on the climate topic, paste it; if not, we’ll draft a short one together aligned with your new thesis.

Would you like to choose your targets and try writing a one-sentence thesis now? I’ll help refine it step by step.

- Previews your main points (the reasons you’ll discuss)
- Uses confident, precise language (avoid “I think,” “maybe”)

Would you like to choose your targets and try writing your one-sentence thesis now? I’ll give you quick feedback and we’ll refine it together. After we finalize the thesis (Step 1), we’ll pick one body paragraph to revise next (Step 2 and Step 3).

*Time:* 2025-11-26T18:44:08.272Z

**You:** Revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-26T19:01:01.260Z

**Assistant:** Wonderful—thanks for sharing your draft. Before we jump into Step 1, let’s set clear targets and do a quick diagnosis so our revision is focused and efficient.

Preliminary Stage — Negotiating Targets and Diagnosing the Essay

1) Your goals
Which two improvements matter most to you right now?
- Clarity and a strong viewpoint
- Argument strength and logical flow
- Structure and paragraphing
- Vocabulary (precise, topic-specific academic terms)
- Grammar and sentence control
- Style (confident, formal academic tone)

2) Diagnostic feedback (aligned to your rubric)
Note: Your draft focuses on automation and jobs, but the assignment asks: “Some people believe that individual actions are insignificant in the fight against climate change compared to the efforts of governments and large corporations. To what extent do you agree or disagree?” Because the content is off-topic, scores would be limited even if the writing is fluent.

- Content and Ideas: Limited — doesn’t answer the climate-change prompt; no clear stance on the question.
- Organisation and Logical Progression: Basic — paragraphs exist but don’t build toward a claim relevant to the prompt.
- Vocabulary: Basic–Developing — general academic words; few climate terms (e.g., emissions, mitigation, policy, decarbonization).
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: Developing — mostly understandable with some awkward phrasing.

Strengths to build on:
- Balanced, analytical tone (you consider both sides)
- Global/long-term perspective
- Willingness to discuss societal impacts

3) Your priority selection
I recommend:
- Target A: Thesis clarity and direct relevance to the climate-change prompt
- Target B: Organisation (topic sentences that align with the thesis)
Optional Target C: Vocabulary (precise climate-related terms)

Please choose your top two (A, B, or C). Once you confirm, we’ll start Step 1.

Preparing for Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision
To help you write a strong thesis, please tell me:
- Your stance: agree, disagree, or partially agree with “individual actions are insignificant compared to governments and corporations”?
- Two or three main reasons you’ll use (e.g., scale of emissions, policy leverage, market signals from consumers, social norms, political participation, technology adoption).

Now, try drafting one sentence that:
- Answers the question directly (your stance)
- Previews your main points
- Uses confident, precise language (no “I think,” “maybe”)

Helpful templates (choose one and adapt it):
- Disagree: Individual actions are significant in combating climate change because they reduce household emissions, shift market demand toward low-carbon products, and generate political pressure for stronger policies, even though systemic actors hold major levers.
- Partially agree: While governments and corporations drive the largest emissions cuts through regulation and investment, individual actions are not insignificant because they reshape demand, build social norms, and mobilize voters, making personal and systemic efforts complementary.
- Agree: Individual actions are relatively insignificant compared to governments and corporations because large-scale regulation, infrastructure, and corporate supply chains determine most emissions; individuals still matter mainly through voting and advocacy rather than lifestyle changes.

Your turn:
- Please confirm your two targets (A, B, or C).
- Share your stance and 2–3 reasons.
- Draft your one-sentence thesis using a template above or your own version. I’ll give quick, focused feedback and help you refine it.

**Assistant:** Great to meet you—thanks for sharing your draft. Before we begin the three-step revision workflow, let’s set clear targets and do a quick diagnosis so we focus on what will help you most.

Preliminary Stage — Negotiating Targets and Diagnosing the Essay

1) Your goals
Which two improvements matter most to you right now?
- Clarity and a strong viewpoint
- Argument strength and logical flow
- Structure and paragraphing
- Vocabulary (precise, topic-specific academic terms)
- Grammar and sentence control
- Style (confident, formal academic tone)

2) Diagnostic feedback (aligned with your course rubric and current assignment)
Note: Your assigned topic is “Migrant workers face exploitation due to weak regulations, enduring long hours and unfair pay. Should governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights?” but your essay discusses automation and AI’s impact on employment. Because it’s off-topic, scores would be limited even if the writing is fluent.

- Content and Ideas: Limited (1)
  - The essay does not address the migrant worker question; there’s no clear viewpoint answering whether governments should enforce stricter laws.
- Organisation and Logical Progression: Developing (3)
  - There is paragraphing and some logical flow, but ideas don’t develop toward the assigned prompt or a clear central claim.
- Vocabulary: Developing (3)
  - General academic vocabulary; lacks topic-specific terms for migrant labor (e.g., wage theft, overtime violations, recruitment fees, contract enforcement, labor inspections, compliance mechanisms).
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: Developing–Proficient (3–4)
  - Mostly correct sentences; some awkward phrasing and repetition, but generally understandable.

Strengths to build on:
- Balanced, analytical tone (you acknowledge benefits and harms).
- Global/long-term perspective.
- Consistent paragraphing and academic register.

3) Your priority selection
Recommended focus for this session:
- Target A: Thesis clarity and direct relevance to the migrant worker prompt.
- Target B: Organisation (topic sentences that align clearly with the thesis).
Optional:
- Target C: Vocabulary (precise labor-rights and policy terms).

Please choose your top two targets (A, B, or C). Once you confirm, we’ll begin Step 1.

To prepare for Step 1 (Thesis Statement Revision), please also tell me:
- Your stance on the prompt: Should governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights? Do you agree, disagree, or partially agree?
- Two or three main reasons you want to use (for example: effective deterrence and enforcement; closing loopholes in subcontracting and recruitment; improving inspection and penalties; protecting basic standards—wages, hours, safety; addressing cross-border issues; potential economic trade-offs; feasibility and implementation).

Then, try drafting one sentence that:
- Answers the question directly (your stance).
- Previews your main points (the reasons you’ll discuss).
- Uses confident, precise language (avoid “I think,” “maybe”).

Helpful templates (choose one and adapt it):
- Agree: Governments should enforce stricter labor laws to protect migrant workers because stronger inspection and penalties deter exploitation, standardized contracts and wage protections close common loopholes, and cross-border cooperation ensures accountability in recruitment and supply chains.
- Partially agree: While stricter laws are essential to curb exploitation, they must be paired with transparent enforcement and employer compliance programs; together these measures safeguard wages and hours without imposing impractical burdens on small firms.
- Disagree: Stricter laws alone are insufficient; targeted enforcement, worker education, and employer incentives are more effective in reducing exploitation and ensuring fair pay and safe working hours.

Your turn:
- Please confirm your two targets (A, B, or C).
- Share your stance and 2–3 reasons.
- Draft your one-sentence thesis. I’ll give quick, focused feedback and help you refine it.

Once we finalize the thesis (Step 1), we’ll move to Step 2 by selecting one body paragraph to revise (topic sentence first), and then Step 3 to adjust its supporting sentences for clarity, unity, and coherence. Would you like to choose your targets and try your thesis sentence now?

**Assistant:** Great to meet you. I’m here to help you revise in a structured, supportive way. Before we start the three-step workflow, let’s set clear targets and do a quick diagnosis so we focus on what will help you most.

Preliminary Stage — Negotiating Targets and Diagnosing the Essay

1) Your goals
Which two improvements matter most to you right now?
- Clarity and a strong viewpoint
- Argument strength and logical flow
- Structure and paragraphing
- Vocabulary (precise, topic-specific academic terms)
- Grammar and sentence control
- Style (confident, formal academic tone)

2) Diagnostic feedback (aligned with your course rubric and current assignment)
Note: Your assigned topic is “Migrant workers face exploitation due to weak regulations, enduring long hours and unfair pay. Should governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard their rights?” but your draft discusses automation and AI’s impact on employment. Because it’s off-topic, your score would be limited even if the writing is fluent.

- Content and Ideas: 1 (Limited)
  - Does not address the migrant worker question; no clear viewpoint on whether stricter laws are needed.
- Organisation and Logical Progression: 3 (Developing)
  - Paragraphs and a general flow are present, but ideas don’t build toward the assigned prompt or a central claim.
- Vocabulary: 3 (Developing)
  - General academic vocabulary; limited topic-specific labor-rights terms (e.g., wage theft, overtime violations, recruitment fees, contract enforcement, labor inspections, penalties).
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 3–4 (Developing–Proficient)
  - Mostly correct sentences; some repetition and awkward phrasing, but understandable.

Strengths to build on:
- Balanced, analytical tone (you acknowledge benefits and harms).
- Global/long-term perspective.
- Consistent paragraphing and an academic register.

3) Your priority selection
Recommended focus for this session:
- Target A: Thesis clarity and direct relevance to the migrant worker prompt.
- Target B: Organisation (topic sentences that align clearly with the thesis).
Optional:
- Target C: Vocabulary (precise labor-rights and policy terms).

Please choose your top two targets (A, B, or C). Once you confirm, we’ll begin Step 1.

To prepare for Step 1 (Thesis Statement Revision), please also share:
- Your stance: Should governments enforce stricter laws to safeguard migrant workers’ rights? Do you agree, disagree, or partially agree?
- Two or three main reasons you will use (for example: stronger inspection and penalties deter exploitation; standardized contracts and wage protections close common loopholes; cross-border cooperation addresses recruitment abuses; better enforcement mechanisms; potential economic trade-offs and feasibility).

When you reply:
- Confirm your two targets (e.g., “A and B”).
- State your stance and list 2–3 reasons.
- Draft a one-sentence thesis that answers the question and previews your reasons (use confident language; avoid “I think,” “maybe”).

If you want a quick template to adapt, here are three options you can modify after you share your stance:
- Agree: Governments should enforce stricter labor laws to protect migrant workers because stronger inspections and penalties deter exploitation, standardized wage and hour protections close common loopholes, and cross-border cooperation enhances accountability in recruitment and supply chains.
- Partially agree: Stricter laws are essential, but they must be paired with transparent enforcement and employer compliance programs; together these measures safeguard wages and hours without imposing impractical burdens on smaller firms.
- Disagree: Stricter laws alone are insufficient; targeted enforcement, worker education, and employer incentives more effectively reduce exploitation and ensure fair pay and safe working hours.

Your turn:
- Which two targets would you like to focus on?
- What is your stance and your 2–3 reasons?
- Would you like to try writing your one-sentence thesis now? I’ll give quick, encouraging feedback and help you refine it.

**You:** Directly edit the article                                          Automation is one of the most important forces in modern times, and like a coin, it has two sides. With the development of high technology, AI is entering and reshaping various industries, and people must face the rise of tools like AI. Under this background, global employment prospects may ultimately improve in the long term.

As we all know, the use of AI will become increasingly common. Enterprises will try to adopt AI and automated systems to raise their work standards and productivity. In this process, the number of certain jobs may decrease. However, over time, people will learn how to use AI to solve more complex and comprehensive problems. Technological shifts can improve people’s abilities in specific areas. From a global perspective, employment will continue to evolve in the future.

It is also true that automation can reduce motivation and contribute to job losses. At first, automation may not be implemented efficiently, so people may struggle to find a positive way to maintain morale. AI, as a smarter tool, can handle difficult tasks that humans may not perform well, and it can finish large volumes of work quickly. As a result, some basic jobs may no longer be necessary for human workers. From an individual point of view, technological change may seem harmful because it can lead to more unemployment.

The development of industry, society, and countries will always face various problems. But progress is constant, and we cannot stop the rise of technology. Therefore, we need to explore the best ways to avoid the worst outcomes.

Automation can undoubtedly improve efficiency; meanwhile, we must not lose confidence. People need to find a harmonious balance between automation and tradition.
