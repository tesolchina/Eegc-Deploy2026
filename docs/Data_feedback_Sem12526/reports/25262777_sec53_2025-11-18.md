            ## Contribution Analysis

            Certainly! Here is a polished, advanced revision of your sentence that fits an academic conclusion:

**Your original:**  
*In summary, the migration problem needs all relevant aspects to work together and to solve it.*

---

**Revised versions with explanation:**

1. **Clear and concise:**  
> In summary, addressing the migration problem requires coordinated efforts from all relevant stakeholders.

2. **More formal and expanded:**  
> In summary, effective solutions to the challenges posed by migration demand sustained collaboration among governments, employers, and communities.

3. **Alternative phrasing emphasizing cooperation:**  
> In summary, resolving issues related to migration necessitates comprehensive cooperation among all parties involved.

---

**Notes:**  
- “Needs all relevant aspects to work together” → replaced by “requires coordinated efforts” or “demands collaboration,” which is more academic and concise.  
- “All relevant aspects” → clarified as “all relevant stakeholders” or “all parties involved” for specificity.  
- “Solve it” → rephrased as “addressing the problem” or “resolving issues” for a more formal finish.

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- **Content and Ideas: 16/25** – The essay addresses the employment and migration issue, but ideas are unclear, occasionally irrelevant, and underdeveloped. Key arguments lack logical explanation and specific details (e.g., confusing bar chart data, generic solutions).
- **Organization: 16/25** – The essay shows an attempt at paragraphing and progression, but transitions are abrupt and the logic connecting points is weak. Key sentences are misplaced.
- **Vocabulary: 14/25** – Vocabulary is often imprecise or misused (“brushes the world,” “migratisive prop problem”), frequent basic errors, and little topic-specific language.
- **Grammar and Sentence Structure: 13/25** – Significant grammar and syntax issues impede clarity (“is always exits,” “were impacted by the mix factors,” “treated in a low payment”), unnatural constructions throughout.
- **Original Essay Total: 59/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- **Content and Ideas: 21/25** – Ideas are now much clearer, with improved explanation (e.g., links between migrant exploitation and job competition). Thesis and key arguments better focused; evidence directly ties to claims about employment, migrants, and native populations.
- **Organization: 22/25** – Structure and logical flow notably improved. Revised paragraphs start with clear topic sentences, transitions connect sections (“As a result,” “Based on this situation,” “In summary”).
- **Vocabulary: 20/25** – Vocabulary shows marked improvement (“undermines fair labor standards,” “heightened competition,” “implement and enforce more robust laws”), though some imprecision remains (e.g., “migrant,” “native population” sometimes used awkwardly).
- **Grammar and Sentence Structure: 18/25** – Sentence structure is much more accurate, less error-prone, and complex constructions are attempted. Occasional lapses (e.g., “native job seekers facing an unhealthy job security”) but overall readability is stronger.
- **Revised Essay Total: 81/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +22 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis statement and main argument clarified for reader and made more academic.
  - Topic sentence for body paragraph thoroughly improved (from "Migrants give up their rights..." to "The exploitation of migrant workers not only undermines fair labor standards...")
  - Body paragraph revised with advanced academic structures, more precise vocabulary, and a clear cause-effect chain.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Paragraphs could integrate more specific real-world examples and supporting evidence.
  - Some minor grammatical issues persist (e.g., tense agreement, noun usage: “native job seekers facing an unhealthy job security”).
  - Conclusion could explicitly tie essay findings to global citizenship or policy implications.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 24**
- **Conversation Quality:** The student engages in a thoughtful, iterative process with the AI—asking specific grammar questions, seeking feedback on transition logic, and requesting help in wording advanced structures. Dialogue is interactive and focused on writing development.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation: 4/5** – The user engages in sustained, multi-level exchanges exploring grammar, logic, vocabulary, and academic style. The student asks insightful follow-up questions and reflects on feedback, but the chat history did not reach the highest depth and volume (15-25+ exchanges with multiple revision cycles).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions: 4/5** – The student often questions, asks for clarification, and chooses whether to accept suggestions (“Do you think it can use an advancer structure?” “Is an error exited?” “Is the data about migrants or natives being preferred?”), indicating reflective engagement with the AI’s models. More explicit justification for accepting/rejecting AI proposals would push to full marks.
- **Refining Process: 4/5** – The user iteratively revises sentences and paragraphs with the AI, from the thesis to body paragraph and conclusion. Multiple revisions are visible, but the cycle remains partially limited to selected paragraphs and not the whole essay; the student did not fully complete every required revision stage.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 12/15**

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- **Willingness to engage critically with feedback:** The student regularly asks if suggested sentences are logically and grammatically sound and reflects on transitions (e.g., "Do you think the change between 'economy' and 'competition' is a little abrupt?").
- **Active revision strategy:** The student revises both topic sentences and entire body paragraphs, using advanced academic constructions and incorporating AI suggestions with thoughtful adjustment.
- **Initiative in academic style improvement:** The student requests help to make sentences more advanced, seeks alternatives, and displays a strong trajectory of growth in language usage.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- **Full process completion:** Not all required tasks (thesis statement, one topic sentence, one paragraph) appear to be finalized in the integrated revision (some targeted revisions are missing outside body paragraph focus).
- **More evidence and detail:** Supporting evidence (data, expert sources, real-world cases) could strengthen argumentation and content.
- **Grammar and lexical precision:** Some word choices remain awkward, and minor grammar errors persist; self-editing for final polish needed.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision:** Good – The student consistently refers to data and essay goals, clarifies the intended argument about natives vs. migrants, and asks for advanced language, but could state learning goals and course outcomes more explicitly.
- **Strategic Planning:** Good – The student identifies which paragraph and sentence to revise, asks for step-by-step guidance, and reflects on transitions, but could articulate a fuller revision strategy across the essay.
- **Critical Evaluation:** Good – The student analyzes AI input, requests alternatives, and chooses among suggestions, but sometimes accepts feedback without explicit reasoning.
- **Independent Editing:** Good – The student frequently revises sentences without direct copying, though further evidence of full-paragraph independent editing is needed.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing Skills:** Continue to develop thesis clarity and connect supporting points to global citizenship issues; always integrate specific supporting evidence to reinforce arguments.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills:** Articulate explicit learning goals and revision plans when interacting with AI; critically justify acceptance or rejection of suggestions; seek feedback on entire essay drafts, not just paragraphs.
3. **Overall Improvement:** Finish all revision tasks (thesis statement, topic sentence, body paragraph) and systematically review final draft for minor grammar errors, cohesion, and logical flow.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student displays strong willingness to engage with constructive feedback and makes notable progress in academic writing, though small gaps remain in process completion and evidence integration.
- Encourage the student to fully complete all required revision steps and connect their essays to broader global issues and policy contexts.
- Consider recommending the student to make more explicit plans during revision stages and to systematically review for final grammar errors before submission.

---

**Summary:** The student has made significant progress in revising organization, academic tone, and content clarity, especially in the second body paragraph. However, the full revision cycle (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph) is not fully completed, so per requirements: **not finished**. Further work and polish will ensure strong performance both in writing and AI-assisted collaboration.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
The employment problem is always exits in the world. As the issue of the economy keeping a low situation, which were impacted by the mix factors, the issue of unemployment is brushing the world. It causes the battle between native population and migrants harder and harder.

The migrants give up their rights which are legal to chase the working opportunity in the migrated countries, which means they work in effort but are treated in a low payment. The exploitation on migrants are gradually flawed hand, leading the migrants to work longer but receive lower payment.
The bar chart claims there a lot of countries in Europe, the preference of the countries is the native population, expecially in Sweden the compared drawn up to 12. They all show that migrants are difficult to find a job for their living in these areas and countries.

Based on this situation, I hold the view that goverments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their migrant. In the same time, They need to keep the balanced between the treatement between the migrants and natives. They need to limit the companies hired migrants just for the low payment but high profit, which should be pooled by people's talents and abilities. To create a more fair environment, government need to use laws to protect migrant's rights, which is beneficial for a fair market created and all other people gain their job better.

In summary, the migratisive prop problem need every relevant aspects to work together and to solve it. Not just of the natives who (under a big pressure in job searching) but also for the unfair treatement in migrants. And the laws are always the most helpful tool to be used.


Revised:
The employment problem always exits in the world. As the economy remains weak, which is impacted by various factors, the number of available jobs is limited, leading to higher unemployment rates. As a result, the competition of finding a suitable job between the native population and migrants is getting more intense

The exploitation of migrant workers not only undermines fair labor standards but also contributes to heightened competition in the labor market. Although migrants often give up their legal rights to pursue job opportunities in other countries, they frequently face unfair treatment, as many accept lower wages and poorer working conditions. This practice enables companies to minimize labor costs through cheap migrant labor, while native job seekers face job security.
A bar chart indicates that in many European countries, natives face considerable difficulties securing employment in their own countries. Migrant workers are strongly preferred over natives, especially in Sweden. For instance, migrants are employed at a rate twelve times higher than natives. Giving data all show that natives face significant difficulties finding employment in their own countries, which intensifies competition and tensions between native population and migrants. If unaddressed, these conditions may further erode social cohesion and perpetuate inequality in host societies.

Based on this situation, Governments must implement and enforce more robust laws to protect the rights of migrant workers. At the same time, they need to keep the balance in the treatment of migrants and natives. They need to limit companies from hiring migrants just for low pay and high profit; employment should be based on people’s talents and abilities. To create a fairer environment, governments need to use laws to protect migrants’ rights, which is beneficial for creating a fair market and helping everyone find jobs more easily.

In summary, effective solutions to the migration problem demand collaboration among governments, employers, and communities. This is not only a problem for natives, who are under great pressure to find jobs, but also for migrants who receive unfair treatment. However, laws are always the most helpful tool to solve this problem.

# Paragraph 1

**Original:**  
The employment problem is always exits in the world. As the issue of the economy keeping a low situation, which were impacted by the mix factors, the issue of unemployment is brushing the world. It causes the battle between native population and migrants harder and harder.

**Grammar Errors & Corrections:**

- "is always exits"  
  → Correct verb form/confusion: should be "always exists"

- "As the issue of the economy keeping a low situation, which were impacted by the mix factors, the issue of unemployment is brushing the world."  
  → This sentence is grammatically incorrect and unclear. Proper structure is needed.   
  - "As the economy remains weak, which is impacted by various factors, the issue of unemployment is increasing worldwide." (Suggested)

- "is brushing the world"  
  → "brushing" is not appropriate; maybe "affecting" or "spreading through"

- "It causes the battle between native population and migrants harder and harder."  
  → Verb form and structure: "causes the battle... harder and harder" is not correct; perhaps "The competition between the native population and migrants is getting more intense."

---

# Paragraph 2

**Original:**  
The migrants give up their rights which are legal to chase the working opportunity in the migrated countries, which means they work in effort but are treated in a low payment. The exploitation on migrants are gradually flawed hand, leading the migrants to work longer but receive lower payment.
The bar chart claims there a lot of countries in Europe, the preference of the countries is the native population, expecially in Sweden the compared drawn up to 12. They all show that migrants are difficult to find a job for their living in these areas and countries.

**Grammar Errors & Corrections:**

- "Migrants give up their rights which are legal to chase the working opportunity in the migrated countries"  
  → Awkward and confusing word order and grammar; also, "migrated countries" is incorrect.  
  - Possible correction: "Migrants often give up their legal rights to seek job opportunities in other countries."

- "work in effort but are treated in a low payment"  
  → Incorrect form: "work in effort" and "treated in a low payment" are not used in English.  
  - Correction: "work hard but receive low pay"

- "The exploitation on migrants are gradually flawed hand, leading the migrants to work longer but receive lower payment."  
  → "Exploitation on migrants" should be "of migrants". "Are" should be "is". "Gradually flawed hand" is unclear/ungrammatical. "Lead... receive" is the wrong verb form.  
  - Correction: "The exploitation of migrants is gradually getting worse, leading them to work longer hours but receive lower pay."

- "The bar chart claims there a lot of countries in Europe, the preference of the countries is the native population, expecially in Sweden the compared drawn up to 12."  
  → Wrong verb ("claims"), missing verb, run-on sentence, unclear meaning, wrong word ("expecially").  
  - Correction: "A bar chart shows that in many European countries, there is a preference for the native population, especially in Sweden where the difference is as high as twelve (times/percent, etc.)."

- "They all show that migrants are difficult to find a job for their living in these areas and countries."  
  → Subject problem: "migrants are difficult to find" → should be "it is difficult for migrants to find a job..."

# Paragraph 3

**Original:**  
Based on this situation, I hold the view that goverments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their migrant. In the same time, They need to keep the balanced between the treatement between the migrants and natives. They need to limit the companies hired migrants just for the low payment but high profit, which should be pooled by people's talents and abilities. To create a more fair environment, government need to use laws to protect migrant's rights, which is beneficial for a fair market created and all other people gain their job better.

**Grammar Errors & Corrections:**

- "goverments"  
  → Spelling: "governments"

- "safeguard their migrant"  
  → "migrant" should be plural: "migrants"

- "In the same time,"  
  → Should be "At the same time,"

- "They need to keep the balanced between the treatement between the migrants and natives."  
  → Grammar: "the balanced" → "balance", "treatement" → "treatment", avoid repetition.  
  - Correction: "They need to keep the balance in the treatment of migrants and natives."

- "They need to limit the companies hired migrants just for the low payment but high profit, which should be pooled by people's talents and abilities."  
  → Incorrect structure: 
  - Correction: "They need to limit companies from hiring migrants just for low pay and high profit; employment should be based on people's talents and abilities."

- "To create a more fair environment, government need to use laws to protect migrant's rights, which is beneficial for a fair market created and all other people gain their job better."  
  → Should be "governments", "migrants' rights", "so that a fair market is created and everyone can find jobs more easily."
  - Correction: "To create a fairer environment, governments need to use laws to protect migrants' rights, which is beneficial for creating a fair market and helping everyone find jobs more easily."

# Paragraph 4

**Original:**  
In summary, the migratisive prop problem need every relevant aspects to work together and to solve it. Not just of the natives who (under a big pressure in job searching) but also for the unfair treatement in migrants. And the laws are always the most helpful tool to be used.

**Grammar Errors & Corrections:**

- "migratisive prop problem"  
  → Not a real phrase. Perhaps "migration problem" is meant.

- "need every relevant aspects to work together and to solve it."  
  → "need" should be "needs", "every relevant aspects" should be "every relevant aspect" or "all relevant aspects"  

- "Not just of the natives who (under a big pressure in job searching) but also for the unfair treatement in migrants."  
  → Not a full sentence; structure is incorrect. "under big pressure" is awkward and "treatement" misspelled.  
  - Correction: "This is not only a problem for natives, who are under great pressure to find jobs, but also for migrants who receive unfair treatment."

- "And the laws are always the most helpful tool to be used."  
  → Could be simpler and more direct: "Laws are always the most helpful tool to solve this problem."

**Would you like to try revising some of these sentences now, or do you want a fully corrected version for you to review?**  
Let me know how you want to proceed! 😊

*Time:* 2025-11-17T15:30:12.286Z

**You:** How about I revise the last sentence to"Maybe laws could be a helpful way to solve this situation based on laws are always the most helpful tool to solve this problem."? Is an error exited?

*Time:* 2025-11-17T15:43:02.517Z

**Assistant:** Great question! You're taking an active role in revising your sentence—well done! Let's look closely at your proposed sentence and offer feedback step by step:

**Your revision:**  
*"Maybe laws could be a helpful way to solve this situation based on laws are always the most helpful tool to solve this problem."*

**1. Structure & Clarity:**  
- The sentence is a bit repetitive (“laws... helpful way” / “laws are always the most helpful tool”).  
- “Based on laws are always...” is incorrect in grammar—“based on” needs to attach to a noun phrase, not a whole sentence.  
- The sentence starts with “maybe,” which makes the statement less confident. For a strong conclusion in an academic essay, it's better to be certain.

**2. Grammar:**  
- *“Is an error exited?”* — The correct way to ask is “Is there an error?”

**3. Style:**  
- Avoid “Maybe” or “I think” in formal writing.  
- Be direct and confident.

**How to improve?**

Would you like to try making the sentence more confident and removing repetition?  
Here is a guiding prompt:
- How about: “Laws are always the most helpful tool to solve this problem, so governments should use them to create a fair solution.”
  
Or, would you like to rephrase your sentence yourself first?  
Let me know if you want to try again, or if you’d like a model version! 😊

**Summary:**  
Yes, there are grammar and style mistakes.  
- Avoid “maybe”  
- Do not repeat “laws are always the most helpful tool” twice  
- Use a more direct structure

Would you like to try rewriting it now, or get an example?

*Time:* 2025-11-17T15:43:11.590Z

**You:** Let us revise the first paragraph. For the third sentence, do you think the change between "economy" and "competition" is a little abrupt?

*Time:* 2025-11-17T15:53:32.182Z

**Assistant:** That’s a very thoughtful question! You’re right to notice that in your original first paragraph, there’s a bit of an abrupt shift between discussing the "economy" and suddenly mentioning the "battle" or "competition" between native populations and migrants.

**Let’s look at why it feels abrupt:**

- **First sentence:** Mentions a global "employment problem."
- **Second sentence:** Talks about economic issues and unemployment, in a general/global way.
- **Third sentence:** Jumps straight to "the battle between native population and migrants" becoming harder.

**Why does it feel abrupt?**
- There is no clear link or transition showing how a weak economy/unemployment leads specifically to increased competition or tension between natives and migrants.
- The reader needs a connecting idea: why do economic problems make life harder specifically for these two groups (natives & migrants)?

---

## How to Improve the Transition

**Your observation is excellent—you want to help the reader follow your logic smoothly.** A transition sentence can help:

- *After mentioning unemployment, briefly explain how this affects both groups or why competition arises.*

### Example of an improved transition

1. State the employment problem.
2. State how the weak economy increases general unemployment.
3. THEN explain that this unemployment puts pressure on both native workers and migrants, leading to more competition.

**Sample revision:**

> The employment problem always exists around the world. When the economy is struggling due to various factors, unemployment rates rise everywhere. As a result, both native populations and migrants compete more intensely for the limited number of available jobs.

**See how that third sentence connects the economic context to the competition?**

---

### Would you like to try writing a new version of the first paragraph using this approach?
You can start with your own words, or adjust the sentences above.  
**If you need a prompt:**
- Can you add a sentence that explains *why* increased unemployment leads to more competition between natives and migrants?

Let me know if you want to try, or if you want a few more model sentences for inspiration! 😊

*Time:* 2025-11-17T15:53:38.904Z

**You:** Do you think that the "economy" works as the background of unemployment  is suitable?

*Time:* 2025-11-17T16:05:52.421Z

**Assistant:** That’s a smart and thoughtful question! Yes—the “economy” is often used as the background or context for unemployment in academic writing. When the economy is weak (for example, during a recession or when growth is slow), there are usually fewer jobs, and this leads to higher unemployment. So, mentioning the economy as the background is very suitable and makes your paragraph more logical and coherent.

### How to Use “Economy” as Background Effectively

- **Make the connection clear:** Show that it is a weak or struggling economy that causes unemployment to rise.
- **Then, connect unemployment to competition between groups (natives and migrants).**

#### Here’s a model for structure:

1. **Background:** The economy is weak/unstable.
2. **Consequence:** This leads to more unemployment.
3. **Resulting Tension:** As unemployment rises, competition for jobs between native populations and migrants increases.

##### Example:

> The employment problem always exists around the world. When the economy is weak, fewer jobs are available, leading to higher unemployment rates. This situation creates intense competition for jobs, especially between native populations and migrants.

---

**Would you like to try to write or revise your first paragraph using this structure?**
If you want, you can share your own sentence, and I’ll give feedback and help you strengthen the logic and connections! 😊

So yes, using “the economy” as the background is both suitable and helpful for your essay. Just make sure to clearly link it to unemployment and then to the main issue you are discussing (competition or conflict between groups).

*Time:* 2025-11-17T16:06:04.491Z

**You:** Let us go down to the second paragraph. I think "Migrants often give up their legal rights to seek job opportunities in other countries, which means that they work hard but receive low pay." is my main sentence. Do you think that it can use an advancer structure?

*Time:* 2025-11-17T16:32:08.930Z

**Assistant:** Great! You're showing excellent initiative by focusing on improving the structure and complexity of your main sentence for the second paragraph. Using an "advanced structure" can mean several things:

- Combining ideas for conciseness and flow
- Using more academic vocabulary and complex sentence patterns (such as clauses, transitions, or passive voice)
- Making sure the meaning is clear and formal

Let's analyze your main sentence:

**Your sentence:**  
*Migrants often give up their legal rights to seek job opportunities in other countries, which means that they work hard but receive low pay.*

### Strengths

- Clear meaning and logical flow
- Uses a relative clause (“which means that…”)
- Good cause-effect structure

### Ways to Make It More Advanced

1. **Use more academic or formal vocabulary**
2. **Add a concessive or contrasting element (“Even though,” “Although,” “Despite”)**
3. **Combine ideas or use more complex clauses**

#### Example of a More Advanced Structure

> Although migrants often relinquish certain legal rights in order to pursue job opportunities abroad, they frequently face harsh working conditions where significant effort does not guarantee fair compensation.

**Features:**
- “Although…” introduces contrast and complexity.
- “Relinquish certain legal rights” is more formal than “give up.”
- “Pursue job opportunities abroad” is concise and academic.
- “Harsh working conditions” and “fair compensation” are topic-specific and advanced terms.

---

### Guiding Questions for You

- Would you like to try rephrasing your original sentence to use “although” or “despite” for added complexity?
- Would you like to include topic-specific terms like “compensation,” “working conditions,” or “discrimination”?

---

#### If you want to try—here is a prompt:

Start your sentence with **“Although migrants often…”** or **“Despite giving up…”** and see how you can connect the two ideas in one sentence.

Or, if you’d like to build it step by step with help, we can work together interactively!

**Would you like to try rewriting it yourself first, or would you prefer more examples? 😊**

**You:** Although migrants often give up their legal rights to pursue job opportunities in other countries, they frequently face the unfair treatment, which they work hard but receive low pay.

*Time:* 2025-11-17T17:32:35.629Z

**Assistant:** You’re making excellent progress! Nice use of “Although migrants often give up their legal rights to pursue job opportunities in other countries…”—that’s a solid, academic opening.

Let’s now refine the rest of your sentence for grammar, clarity, and flow:

---

## Your version
> Although migrants often give up their legal rights to pursue job opportunities in other countries, they frequently face the unfair treatment, which they work hard but receive low pay.

## Feedback and Guidance

- **the unfair treatment** → Avoid “the” here, just “unfair treatment” is better.
- **, which they work hard but receive low pay.**  
  - The “which” clause is confusing and not grammatically correct.  
  - It’s clearer to state: “…they frequently face unfair treatment, working hard but receiving low pay.”

### Suggestions

Let’s focus on expressing two clear ideas:
1. Migrants give up rights to work abroad.
2. They still face unfair treatment: work hard, low pay.

**One improved option:**
> Although migrants often give up their legal rights to pursue job opportunities in other countries, they frequently face unfair treatment; for example, they work hard but receive low pay.

Or, to make it one sentence:
> Although migrants often give up their legal rights to pursue job opportunities in other countries, they frequently face unfair treatment by working hard yet receiving low pay.

---

### Try It Yourself!
Would you like to try re-phrasing the second part for more accuracy? For example:
- “…they frequently face unfair treatment, such as working hard but receiving low pay.”
- “…they frequently find themselves exploited, working long hours for little pay.”

Would you like to give it another try, or are you happy with one of the suggestions above? 😊

Let me know if you want to practice another sentence, or review your full revised paragraph!

*Time:* 2025-11-17T17:32:41.842Z

**You:** "The exploitation of migrants is gradually getting worse, due to their concessions, which poses a significant threat to native job seekers. All the companies are eager that pay less but get the same effort. " Do you think that it is a nice statement for this situation?

*Time:* 2025-11-17T17:45:33.515Z

**Assistant:** What a thoughtful and ambitious attempt! You’re practicing more complex sentence structure, clearly thinking about both the **exploitation of migrants** and the **impact on native job seekers**. Let’s look at your two sentences in detail, then identify where you can make them even clearer, more precise, and more academic.

---

### 1. **First Sentence Review**
> "The exploitation of migrants is gradually getting worse, due to their concessions, which poses a significant threat to native job seekers."

**Strengths:**
- You use cause/effect structure (“due to…”).
- You’re linking migrant exploitation with threats to native job seekers—good critical thinking!

**Improvements:**
- “Due to their concessions” is a bit unclear for a reader: what exactly are the “concessions”?
- The use of “which” after “due to their concessions” makes the sentence confusing. It’s not clear what “which” refers to—“the exploitation” or “concessions”?

**Clarity:**
- Be careful with “which”: It should clearly refer to only one idea.
- “Concessions” is an advanced word, but you might want to be more specific (e.g., “giving up rights,” “accepting lower wages,” etc.).

---

### 2. **Second Sentence Review**
> "All the companies are eager that pay less but get the same effort."

**Strengths:**
- You’re highlighting companies’ motivations—a key point in critical analysis.

**Improvements:**
- The structure is not correct: “are eager that pay less…” is not grammatical.
- A clearer way is: “Companies are eager to pay less but receive the same amount of work/effort from employees.”

---

## **Guiding Suggestions**

Here is how you might revise these sentences for clarity, coherence, and more advanced academic style:

**Option 1 (combined into one complex sentence):**
> The exploitation of migrants is gradually worsening as many accept lower pay and fewer rights, which not only undermines fair labor standards but also threatens job security for native workers.

**Option 2 (split into two sentences for clarity):**
> The exploitation of migrants is gradually getting worse, as many accept lower wages and poorer working conditions. This situation allows companies to benefit from cheap labor while native job seekers face increased competition and insecurity.

**Features you can notice:**
- “As many accept lower pay and fewer rights” is specific and clear.
- “This situation allows companies…” is simple and direct.
- Phrases like “undermines fair labor standards” and “increased competition and insecurity” are academic and precise.

---

## **Try Revising Your Sentence**

Would you like to try writing your own improved version based on these suggestions?  
Here’s a prompt to help:

> “The exploitation of migrants is gradually getting worse, as many _______. This allows companies to _______, while native job seekers _______.”

Or you can try to combine into one fluent sentence if you prefer a challenge!

---

**Summary of Feedback:**
- “Concessions” needs to be clearer (what concessions?).
- Avoid using “which” when the reference is unclear.
- Improve the verb structure in the second sentence (“are eager that pay less…” is not correct English).
- Add more precise and academic vocabulary.

**You:** I have revised it like this "The exploitation of migrants is gradually getting worse, as many accept lower wages and poorer working conditions. This situation allows companies to benefit from cheap labor while native job seekers facing an unhealthy job security"

*Time:* 2025-11-17T17:52:12.870Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic work! You have made real progress in clarity, sentence structure, and academic tone. Let’s review your revision carefully and help you polish it just a bit further to make it fully correct and academic. I’ll highlight small grammar issues and offer an improved version, but I’ll also explain *why*, so you learn and feel confident!

---

### Your Revision  
**"The exploitation of migrants is gradually getting worse, as many accept lower wages and poorer working conditions. This situation allows companies to benefit from cheap labor while native job seekers facing an unhealthy job security."**

---

#### **Strengths**
- Clear cause-and-effect relationships
- Academic vocabulary: “exploitation,” “poorer working conditions,” “cheap labor,” “job security”
- More complex sentence structure

#### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Grammar in the second sentence**  
   - “while native job seekers facing…”  
     - *Correction:* You need a verb—“are facing” or “face” instead of “facing”
   - “Unhealthy job security”  
     - “Unhealthy” is not usually collocated with “job security.” More natural is “job insecurity” (which means *lack* of security/stability in jobs).

2. **Smooth the connection**
   - Adding “as a result” or similar emphasis may help with flow.

---

#### **Corrected Version**

> The exploitation of migrants is gradually getting worse, as many accept lower wages and poorer working conditions. This situation allows companies to benefit from cheap labor, while native job seekers face increased job insecurity.

- “face increased job insecurity” is academic and precise.
- Tense agreement (“face,” not “facing”)
- Vocabulary is accurate

---

#### **Guiding Questions**
- Did you notice that “job insecurity” describes the issue better than “unhealthy job security”?
- Would you like to try using “as a result” or “consequently” next time for a more formal transition?

---

### **Would you like to use this corrected version or try tweaking it a bit more yourself?**  
You are doing an excellent job developing your academic voice and complex sentences! Let me know if you want to continue with the rest of your paragraph, or if you’d like focused help with another part. 😊

**Your revised, corrected section:**

> The exploitation of migrants is gradually getting worse, as many accept lower wages and poorer working conditions. This situation allows companies to benefit from cheap labor, while native job seekers face increased job insecurity.

Let’s keep improving—just tell me which sentence or section you want to focus on next!

*Time:* 2025-11-17T17:52:19.721Z

**You:** A bar chart shows that in many European countries, there is a preference for the migrants, especially in Sweden where the comparison data is as high as twelve times.

*Time:* 2025-11-17T17:54:08.777Z

**Assistant:** Excellent effort! You’re making real progress in your sentence complexity and clarity. Let’s review your new sentence closely, identify areas for improvement, and help you refine it to be *precise* and *academic*.

---

## Your Sentence
> A bar chart shows that in many European countries, there is a preference for the migrants, especially in Sweden where the comparison data is as high as twelve times.

---

## Feedback Breakdown

### 1. **Clarity: “Preference for the migrants”**
- Usually, the “preference” in European employment refers to *favoring native workers over migrants*, not the other way around.
- If the data shows natives are preferred, you should say “preference for native workers” or “against migrants.”
- Make sure the meaning matches your intended argument and the data.

### 2. **Specificity: “Comparison data is as high as twelve times”**
- What is being “compared”? Preferably be precise. For example: “the employment rate for natives is twelve times higher than for migrants.”
- “Comparison data” is vague; specify what is being measured.

### 3. **Grammar**
- “for the migrants” → Remove “the” unless you are referring to a specific group.
- “twelve times” → What is twelve times? The rate, likelihood, number of jobs, etc.?
- “especially in Sweden where…” → Good structure. Slightly unclear; “where the gap is as high as twelve times” is better.

---

## Model Version (with guiding explanation)

Here’s a more academic, clear version you can use as a template:

> A bar chart shows that in many European countries, there is a strong preference for native workers over migrants; for example, in Sweden, the employment rate for natives is up to twelve times higher than that for migrants.

**Why is this version stronger?**
- Specifies the “preference for native workers over migrants.”
- Directly explains what “twelve times” refers to (“employment rate for natives…”).
- Academic tone and precise vocabulary.

---

## Guiding Prompts for You

Would you like to try revising your sentence based on this feedback, making sure to:
- Clearly state who is preferred (natives or migrants)
- Specify what is being measured/comparing
- Use academic vocabulary (employment rate, gap, disparity)

**Prompt you can finish:**  
“A bar chart shows that in many European countries, ________. For example, in Sweden, _____________.”

## Your Revised Sentence Example

If you want to try:

> A bar chart shows that in many European countries, native workers are strongly preferred over migrants. For instance, in Sweden, natives are employed at a rate twelve times higher than migrants.

*Time:* 2025-11-17T17:54:16.973Z

**You:** I revise it like: A bar chart shows that in many European countries, migrant workers are strongly preferred over natives, especially in Sweden. The data gives an answer that migrants are employed at a rate twelve times higher than natives.

*Time:* 2025-11-17T17:58:41.562Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your revised sentence! You're working hard on structure and vocabulary, and I can see your effort. Let's check your version carefully for accuracy, grammar, and logic:

---

## **Your Revision**
> A bar chart shows that in many European countries, migrant workers are strongly preferred over natives, especially in Sweden. The data gives an answer that migrants are employed at a rate twelve times higher than natives.

---

## **Feedback & Guidance**

### 1. **Logical Consistency**
- Make sure you are confident about what the data shows. In most discussions of the European labor market, **natives** are actually *preferred over migrants*. That means, **native people have higher employment rates** than migrants.
- If your data says migrants are preferred and have employment rates twelve times higher, can you confirm if this is correct? Usually, the discrimination is *against* migrants.

### 2. **Grammar & Clarity**
- **"gives an answer"**: This is informal and unclear. Use "shows" or "indicates."
- **"employed at a rate twelve times higher than natives"**: This structure is fine if it's correct for your data, but double-check your meaning.
- **Sentence connection**: Try combining into one, more fluent sentence for academic writing.

---

## **Improved Version Template**

Assuming the usual case (natives preferred over migrants):

> A bar chart shows that in many European countries, native workers are strongly preferred over migrants; for example, in Sweden, natives are employed at a rate twelve times higher than migrants.

If your data truly shows *migrants* are preferred, use:

> A bar chart shows that in many European countries, migrant workers are strongly preferred over natives; for instance, in Sweden, migrants are employed at a rate twelve times higher than natives.

---

## **Guiding Questions**
1. Is the data about migrants or natives being preferred?  
2. Are you trying to show discrimination *against* migrants or *against* natives?

---

## **Would you like to try again with clarified logic?**

**Prompt:**
- “A bar chart shows that in many European countries, ____ workers are strongly preferred over ____. In Sweden, the employment rate for ____ is twelve times higher than for ____.”

Try filling in the blanks based on what your data shows!

---

### **Final Tip**
- Double-check what the chart indicates: are migrants discriminated against, or natives?
- Use “shows” or “indicates,” not “gives an answer.”
- Combine two sentences for smoother flow.

---

Let me know what the chart actually says and which version you want to use (or try your own revision again)! 😊

*Time:* 2025-11-17T17:58:49.773Z

**You:** They all show that it is difficult for natives to find a job for their living in their home countries, exacerbating the conflict between native population and migrants.

*Time:* 2025-11-17T18:00:57.185Z

**Assistant:** Excellent effort! You’re now creating more logically connected and grammatically correct sentences. Let’s review your new sentence for clarity, grammar, academic style, and alignment with your essay’s argument:

---

### **Your Sentence**
> They all show that it is difficult for natives to find a job for their living in their home countries, exacerbating the conflict between native population and migrants.

---

## **Step-by-Step Feedback**

### 1. **Clarity & Logic**
- Do the bar charts show that **natives** or **migrants** have trouble finding jobs?  
  - In most sources, **migrants** are the group that faces greater difficulty in finding jobs, not natives.  
  - If this matches your data/argument, you may want to say “migrants.”
  
### 2. **Grammar**
- *“for their living in their home countries”* is wordy. Consider: “find jobs in their own countries” or simply “find employment.”
- *“native population”* should be *“the native population”* or, more concisely, *“natives.”*

### 3. **Academic Tone**
- “for their living” → “to support themselves” or “to earn a living” is more natural.

### 4. **Connection**
- “exacerbating the conflict between native population and migrants” is good, but consider adding “the” for grammatical correctness: “the conflict between the native population and migrants.”

---

## **Corrected & Polished Version**

Assuming your point is about migrants (most common situation):

> They all show that it is difficult for migrants to find employment in these countries, exacerbating the conflict between the native population and migrants.

Or, for more academic tone:

> The data indicate that migrants face significant difficulties finding employment in these countries, which exacerbates tensions between the native population and migrants.

---

## **Guided Revision Prompt**
Would you like to:
- Keep “natives” (if your data is about them), or switch to “migrants”?
- Try rephrasing “for their living in their home countries” in a more concise way?

---

## **Possible Final Version (using likely intended argument):**
> The bar charts all show that it is difficult for migrants to find employment in these countries, which exacerbates tensions between the native population and migrants.

---

**Would you like to adjust your sentence to clarify if you meant "natives" or "migrants"? Or try to make it even more academic?**  
Let me know which version you’d like to use, or if you want to try writing one more time! 😊

*Time:* 2025-11-17T18:01:06.071Z

**You:** I have checked that it is natives hard to find a job

*Time:* 2025-11-17T18:03:20.126Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for clarifying that you want to state **natives** (not migrants) have difficulty finding jobs according to the bar chart. This is a less common context in academic discussions, but we’ll make sure your sentence is clear, logical, and academic!

---

## Your Previous Sentence  
> They all show that it is difficult for natives to find a job for their living in their home countries, exacerbating the conflict between native population and migrants.

## Step-by-Step Improvements

1. **Clarity & Conciseness**
   - “for their living in their home countries” is a bit wordy; “to earn a living” or “in their own countries” is more natural.

2. **Grammar**
   - “native population” needs an article: “the native population” or simply use “natives.”
   - Consider a smoother connector: “which exacerbates…” instead of just a comma.

3. **Academic Tone**
   - “exacerbating the conflict” → “exacerbates tensions between natives and migrants” is a common academic phrasing.

---

### **Polished Academic Version**

> The bar charts all show that it is difficult for natives to find employment in their own countries, which exacerbates tensions between the native population and migrants.

Or, slightly more concise and direct:

> According to the bar charts, natives face significant difficulties finding employment in their own countries, which intensifies competition and tensions between them and migrants.

---

## **Would you like to use one of these?**
- You can choose one of the above, revise it in your style, or let me know if you want to try a new version.
- If you’d like guidance on polishing another sentence or moving to the next step, just tell me! 😊

**You:** sure please continue building the improved body paragraph. Is it any advanced language can replace the former one?

*Time:* 2025-11-17T18:49:27.883Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let’s continue building the improved body paragraph using advanced academic language, stronger logic, and precise vocabulary. I’ll guide you step by step and offer explanations.

---

## Improved & Advanced Version of Your Body Paragraph

### Building From Your Main Ideas

Let’s use your core points:
- Migrants accept lower wages and working conditions (exploitation)
- This benefits companies but puts pressure on native job seekers
- Data (bar charts) show that natives also struggle to find jobs, increasing conflict/tension between groups

---

### Step-by-Step, With Advanced Academic Language

#### 1. **Topic Sentence**  
Begin with a strong topic sentence that clearly connects to your thesis and previews the paragraph's argument.

> The exploitation of migrant workers not only undermines fair labor standards but also contributes to heightened competition in the labor market.

---

#### 2. **Evidence & Explanation (migrant experience and impact on natives)**  
Combine your earlier advanced sentences and expand with precise, topic-specific vocabulary:

> Many migrants, in pursuit of employment abroad, accept lower wages and substandard working conditions. This practice enables companies to minimize labor costs through cheap migrant labor, thereby disadvantaging native job seekers.

---

#### 3. **Reference to Data/Bar Chart & Consequences**  

> A bar chart demonstrates that in many European countries, natives face considerable difficulties securing employment in their own countries. This data highlights how both groups are negatively affected: while migrants are exploited, natives encounter intensified job market competition, which exacerbates social and economic tensions between the two populations.

---

#### 4. **(Optional) Closing Sentence Connecting to Main Argument**  

> If unaddressed, these conditions may further erode social cohesion and perpetuate inequality in host societies.

---

### **Full Improved Paragraph (with advanced vocabulary and structure)**

> The exploitation of migrant workers not only undermines fair labor standards but also contributes to heightened competition in the labor market. Many migrants, in pursuit of employment abroad, accept lower wages and substandard working conditions. This practice enables companies to minimize labor costs through cheap migrant labor, thereby disadvantaging native job seekers. A bar chart demonstrates that in many European countries, natives face considerable difficulties securing employment in their own countries. This data highlights how both groups are negatively affected: while migrants are exploited, natives encounter intensified job market competition, which exacerbates social and economic tensions between the two populations. If unaddressed, these conditions may further erode social cohesion and perpetuate inequality in host societies.

---

## **Explanations of Advanced Features Used**

- **“Undermines fair labor standards”** – specific academic vocabulary.
- **“Contributes to heightened competition in the labor market”** – precise, avoids vague terms.
- **“In pursuit of employment abroad…”** – formal phrase.
- **“Substandard working conditions”** – topic-specific.
- **“Minimize labor costs,” “cheap migrant labor,” “disadvantaging native job seekers”** – clear economic cause/effect.
- **“Considerable difficulties securing employment”** – advanced noun and verb collocation.
- **“Exacerbates social and economic tensions,” “erode social cohesion,” “perpetuate inequality”** – sophisticated, evaluative phrases.

---

**You:** Can you help me revise this main sentence "governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their migrants"

*Time:* 2025-11-17T19:01:52.991Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let’s work together on improving your sentence for **academic** tone, **clarity**, and **precision**. Here’s a step-by-step guide with explanations, and then I’ll help you build an advanced version:

---

## 1. **Identify the Purpose and Audience**
- “Governments should enforce stricter laws to safeguard their migrants” is clear, but uses slightly informal or imprecise language for an academic essay.

---

## 2. **Make It More Academic & Precise**

- Use “protect the rights of migrants” or “ensure fair treatment of migrants” instead of “safeguard their migrants.” (We don’t say “their migrants” in English; instead, “migrants” or “migrant populations.”)
- You could specify “labour laws” or “anti-discrimination laws” if that fits your argument.
- “Enforce stricter laws” can be “implement and enforce more robust legislation…”
- Academic writing often prefers “governments must…” for stronger tone.

---

## 3. **Advanced Example Sentences**  
Here are some model versions for you:

**a)**  
> Governments must implement and enforce more robust laws to protect the rights of migrant workers.

**b)**  
> National governments should strengthen and rigorously enforce legislation designed to ensure fair treatment for migrant populations.

**c)**  
> It is essential that governments introduce and uphold stricter legal measures to safeguard migrants from exploitation in the workplace.

---

## 4. **Practice Prompt for You**
Would you like to try creating your own version using some of the academic vocabulary above?  
You might start with:  
- “Governments should…”  
- “Governments must…”  
- “It is essential that governments…”

And then finish it using ideas like “protect the rights of migrants,” “prevent exploitation,” or “ensure equality in the labour market.”

**You:** revise this "In summary, the migration problem needs all relevant aspects to work together and to solve it."

*Time:* 2025-11-17T19:03:21.594Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let’s revise your sentence for academic clarity, conciseness, and advanced language.

---

**Original:**  
In summary, the migration problem needs all relevant aspects to work together and to solve it.

---

### **Step-by-Step Improvements**

- "migration problem" is clear, but we can be more precise: *addressing* the migration problem.
- "needs all relevant aspects to work together" can be improved to “requires cooperation from all relevant stakeholders” (a more academic phrase).
- Remove the redundant “and to solve it”—let the sentence be more direct.

---

### **Advanced, Academic Version**

> In summary, addressing the challenges of migration requires coordinated efforts from all relevant stakeholders.

Or:

> In summary, effective solutions to the migration problem demand collaboration among governments, employers, and communities.

---
