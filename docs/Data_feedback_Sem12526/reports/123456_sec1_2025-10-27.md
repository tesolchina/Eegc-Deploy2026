### Feedback Summary

**Essay Content:**
- You understand the basic idea of climate change and the roles of individuals, governments, and companies.
- However, your ideas are not fully developed or deeply explained.
- Your writing is informal and sometimes unclear due to grammar mistakes.

**Essay Organization & Language:**
- The essay follows a general structure but lacks clear paragraphing and smooth transitions.
- Vocabulary is simple and repetitive; using more precise and varied words would strengthen your essay.
- Grammar mistakes make your sentences awkward and difficult to follow at times.

**Human-AI Interaction:**
- You only had one brief exchange with the AI assistant.
- The AI suggested modifying your thesis statement, but no changes were made.
- You did not explore suggestions further or ask questions for clarification.
- You missed the chance to engage in conversation that could help improve your writing.

### Practical Steps to Improve Your Essay

1. **Thesis Statement Improvement:**
   - Make your thesis clearer and more specific.
   - Example: Instead of "I think individual actions not so important like what government and big companies do," try:  
     *"While governments and companies have greater power to combat climate change, individual actions also play a crucial role in driving broader environmental change."*

2. **Develop Your Ideas More Fully:**
   - Explain why government policies are important with examples.
   - Discuss how individual actions influence companies and governments with clear cause-effect relationships.
   - Avoid vague phrases like “I guess,” “maybe,” and “not sure.”

3. **Organize Your Essay Clearly:**
   - Separate your ideas into paragraphs with topic sentences.
   - Use linking words such as “Firstly,” “Moreover,” “In addition,” “However,” and “Therefore” to connect ideas smoothly.

4. **Expand Your Vocabulary:**
   - Use synonyms and topic-related vocabulary such as “environmental regulations,” “sustainable practices,” “carbon footprint,” “renewable energy,” and “advocacy.”
   - Use more formal language appropriate for essay writing.

5. **Improve Grammar and Sentence Structure:**
   - Practice writing complete sentences and avoiding fragments.
   - Use grammar tools (like Grammarly) or ask the AI for help to revise sentences.
   - Example corrections:  
     - “It is a very big problem now.”  
     - “Governments have more power to make impactful changes.”  
     - “Many small actions by individuals can collectively make a difference.”

### How to Make Better Use of AI Writing Assistance

- Provide the AI with context or specific goals (e.g., “Help me write a clear introduction about climate change”).
- Ask the AI to explain corrections or suggestions so you understand improvements.
- Respond to AI advice actively by revising your essay accordingly.
- Engage in back-and-forth conversations by asking AI questions like:
  - “Can you suggest stronger vocabulary for this sentence?”  
  - “How can I connect these ideas better?”  
  - “What are some examples I can add?”

- Use the AI to spot grammar issues and rewrite sentences more clearly.

### Final Encouragement

Writing well takes practice and revision. Using AI as a partner is a chance to learn and improve step by step. Start by making small changes based on suggestions, then build from there. Remember, the clearer and more thoughtful your writing, the stronger your message will be.

If you want, I can help you revise your essay now by suggesting a clearer thesis or improving a paragraph. Just ask!

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: **17/25** - The essay demonstrates basic awareness of climate change issues and discusses the roles of individuals, governments, and companies. The viewpoint is somewhat clear but lacks depth and development.
- Organization: **17/25** - The essay follows a logical sequence with several relevant points but is structured in brief, informal paragraphs; transitions and cohesion could be improved.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing Skills:** Try to identify specific areas for improvement (e.g., thesis statements, transitions, grammar) and work on revising these in new drafts.
2. **AI Collaboration Skills:** Engage with the AI assistant by asking questions, providing assignment context, and discussing suggestions. Use the AI feedback as a basis for meaningful revisions.
3. **Overall Improvement:** Develop a habit of iterative revision. After receiving AI suggestions, make changes, reflect, and request further feedback, creating a genuine improvement cycle.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student appears to need more guidance on how to collaborate effectively with the AI writing assistant. Consider a class mini-lesson on engaging with revision technology and providing assignment context.
- Encourage students to respond to AI feedback actively—through both chat and essay revision—to strengthen revision skills and maximize the learning benefits of the AI module.

## Complete Conversation
**Assistant:** Original:
Climate change, it is very huge problem now. I think individual actions not so important like what government and big companies do. But still, I kinda disagree because people also can do stuff to help. I will explain my thoughts here.

First, governments and companies, they got more power. They can do big things. Like, government make laws for no pollution. They can stop plastic bags or tell factories to not make so much smoke. Companies also can change their ways. They can use less energy or make stuff that don't hurt environment. This is good because it change many people life at once. So powerful, you know.

But individual actions, they matter too, I guess. If many people do little things, it add up. Like, turn off lights at home save energy. Or buy things from green companies. Then companies think, oh, we must be green to sell more. But sometimes it hard to know if this really work. People don't always do it. Also, one person doing something. It not enough.

Another thing. When people change their life, like stop using car and walk, government see this. Politicians want votes, so they make rules people like. So individual action can push government to do more. Maybe start big movement. But I not sure how many people need to do this for it to work. Just thinking.

Some say individual action too small. One person cannot fix climate change. True, but if million people try, maybe it help. Every small thing count. Or not? I don't know sometimes.

Anyway, I think both individual and government and companies must work. Individual action seem small but if many do it, it big. We need all to fix this problem. Climate change very bad, so everyone must try hard. That's my opinion.
