            ## Contribution Analysis

            To submit your final essay, you need to **validate three steps in order** before submission:

1. **Thesis Statement Revision**  
   Confirm it clearly answers the prompt, previews your main points, and uses confident, academic language.  
   Example confirmation: “I am satisfied with my revised thesis.”

2. **Topic Sentence Revision for the Chosen Body Paragraph**  
   Confirm it links clearly to your thesis, sets up the paragraph’s focus, and uses strong academic language.  
   Example confirmation: “I am satisfied with my revised topic sentence.”

3. **Supporting Sentences Revision for That Paragraph**  
   Confirm the paragraph is unified, coherent, and contains relevant, well-explained evidence with smooth transitions.  
   Example confirmation: “I am satisfied with my revised paragraph.”

You **must validate each step in this sequence** before submitting your full essay. Validation means you review and explicitly confirm satisfaction with that step’s revision. Do not submit the essay without completing all three validations.

If you want, I can help you review any or all steps now to finalize your validations!

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change represents one of the most urgent challenges of our time, and many argue that individual actions pale in comparison to the influence of governments and corporations. While individual efforts alone cannot solve this crisis, citizens can drive meaningful progress both by pressuring governments to enact robust environmental policies and by adopting greener lifestyles that collectively shape market behaviour.
The most powerful way individuals can combat climate change is through collective political advocacy. When citizens unite to demand stronger environmental legislation through voting, protesting, or supporting green candidates, governments face measurable pressure to act. For example, mass mobilizations in several countries have successfully pushed leaders to implement plastic ban and carbon reduction targets. This demonstrates that public pressure can translate into concrete policy. However, this approach has limitations since governments may offer only token responses rather than substantive change, and citizens often lack clear channels for effective political engagement, which can result in slower change.
On the other hand, personal lifestyle changes such as recycling, conserving water, or reducing car use also play a meaningful, secondary, role. While less influential than government action, these choices set social precedents and signal consumer demand for sustainable products. When large numbers of citizens support eco-conscious businesses, companies often adopt greener practices to maintain profitability. Yet this strategy falters when convenience outweighs environmental concerns for most people, and when only a minority participates, the collective impact remains insufficient to meaningfully address the climate problem.
Ultimately, neither individual action or government policy alone can resolve climate change. The most critical contribution citizens can make is by unifying their voice to demand systemic change, while personal green habits support this by normalizing sustainability and influencing corporate behaviour. It’s only through coordinated effort among governments, businesses, and individuals that we can create an effective response to this global crisis.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T10:21:25.279Z

**You:** In my opinion the thesis statement is "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:10:10.895Z

**Assistant:** Great! Thanks for sharing your thesis statement:

**"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."**

Let’s move to Step 1 — Revision of your thesis statement.

**Feedback:**

1. **Clarity:**  
Your thesis clearly shows your position ("partly agree") and mentions both government influence and personal lifestyle choices. However, the thesis could be even stronger if you preview the order/main points you will discuss. Instead of "partly agree," you can state your opinion more confidently.

2. **Strength & Focus:**  
Try to use precise and assertive language rather than qualifiers like "I think" or "I partly agree." Also, consider combining clarity and focus by outlining the two main arguments you will develop (the influence on government and the value of individual actions).

3. **Academic Style:**  
For university-level writing, keep your language formal and avoid overly conversational phrases.

**Suggestions for improvement:**  
- Directly answer the essay prompt (do individual actions matter compared to government/companies?).
- Clearly preview your two main points: influence on government and personal lifestyle choices.

**Guiding Question:**  
Would you like to try revising your thesis now using these hints? Aim for one strong sentence that previews your two main arguments and uses confident wording!  

Take your time—share your revised thesis statement when you’re ready.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:10:18.437Z

**You:** My revised thesis : While individual climate actions are less impactful than government policies, citizens can drive meaningful change both by pressuring politicians and adopting greener lifestyles.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:18:43.924Z

**Assistant:** Great job! Your revised thesis is much clearer, more confident, and effectively previews the two main points you’ll discuss: influencing government and personal green choices.

**What’s working well:**
- It’s one strong, focused sentence.
- “Citizens can drive meaningful change both by pressuring politicians and adopting greener lifestyles” clearly sets up your essay’s direction.
- The language is assertive and academic.

**A few small suggestions to make it even stronger:**
- Consider being explicit about the comparison (individual actions vs. governments/companies).
- Make sure it answers the essay prompt directly.

**Guiding question:**  
Would you like to make any final tweaks based on this feedback, or are you happy with your current version? (You could, for example, specify “Although individual actions are less influential than those of governments and companies...”) Let me know if you want to revise a bit more before we move to Step 2!

If you’re satisfied, please let me know which body paragraph you’d like to revise next (the first or second one).

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:18:49.695Z

**You:** I am satisfied with my thesis, I would like to revise the second body paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:20:22.941Z

**Assistant:** Excellent choice! Let's start Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision for your second body paragraph.

**Current Topic Sentence:**  
“On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.”

**Feedback:**
- This sentence introduces the idea of personal green actions, which matches your thesis.
- However, to make the connection to your thesis even clearer, try to emphasize the role and potential impact of these choices, while acknowledging they are less influential compared to government/company action.
- Aim for a more academic tone and a direct link to your thesis statement’s comparison.

**Suggestions:**  
- Rephrase to show that while these actions are less influential, they still contribute to climate change solutions.
- Include a transition that shows contrast with the previous paragraph about government influence.

**Guiding question:**  
Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now to make it connect more strongly to your thesis?  
For example, you can start with: “Although individual lifestyle changes have less overall impact than government policies, they remain an important part of addressing climate change.”

Whenever you’re ready, write your revised topic sentence and I’ll help you refine it further!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:20:33.599Z

**You:** Here is my revise topic sentence : On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, such as recycling, conserving water, or walking instead of driving.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:27:53.390Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your revised topic sentence!

**Your revision:**  
"On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, such as recycling, conserving water, or walking instead of driving."

**Feedback:**  
- Your sentence is clearer and more specific about the green actions individuals can take.
- However, it would be even stronger if you made the link to your thesis explicit: that these actions are less influential than those of governments or companies, but still play a role.
- Also, try to include a transition that highlights the contrast and keeps the academic tone.

**Guiding questions:**  
- Can you add a phrase to show these actions are less influential, but still meaningful?
- For example, how could you clarify that these personal changes contribute to the overall effort, even if their impact is smaller?

Would you like to try revising the sentence one more time to directly link it to your thesis and show its significance—despite being less impactful? Give it a try!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:27:59.593Z

**You:** I can add : While less influential than government action, these personal choices still play a meaningful role in the collective fight against climate change: they set a positive example for others and signal to companies that consumers demand eco-friendly products

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:32:47.097Z

**Assistant:** Excellent work! That’s a much stronger, clearer topic sentence. Here’s what works well:

- **Direct comparison:** You clearly state these actions are “less influential than government action,” which ties right back to your thesis and contrasts with your first body paragraph.
- **Main idea:** “These personal choices still play a meaningful role in the collective fight against climate change” tells the reader what the paragraph will discuss.
- **Preview of support:** Mentioning the positive example and signaling consumer values sets up the reasons/evidence you will explain.

**Questions for you:**
- Are you happy with this topic sentence, or would you like to make any further tweaks?
- Would you like the signal phrase (“they set a positive example...”) to stay in the topic sentence, or save these supporting ideas for the following sentences?

If you’re satisfied, we can move to Step 3—revising the rest of this paragraph for unity and coherence. Ready to continue?

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:32:54.624Z

**You:** Yes let's move to step 3

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:33:21.318Z

**Assistant:** Perfect! Let's start Step 3 — Revising the rest of your chosen paragraph for unity and coherence.

Here’s your improved topic sentence for Paragraph 2:
**"Although personal green lifestyle choices are less influential than government action, these personal choices still play a meaningful role in the collective fight against climate change."**

Let’s look at your supporting sentences:

> "If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem."

**Feedback & Guiding Questions:**

1. **Unity:**  
All points should clearly support the topic sentence: personal actions matter, even if their effect is limited.
- Are you staying focused on personal green choices—how they help, and what limits their impact?

2. **Coherence:**  
Make sure each idea flows logically to the next.
- Do your sentences clearly connect, using transitions such as “for example,” “however,” or “as a result”?

3. **Expansion/Clarification:**  
- Do you fully explain how individuals’ choices influence companies or set examples?
- Can you clarify how limited participation affects the overall impact?

**Guiding Questions for Revision:**  
- Can you explain more specifically how individual actions send a message to companies?
- How might some people’s reluctance to change limit the effectiveness of personal choices?
- Would you like to add a sentence to summarize why these actions still matter, even if not everyone participates?

**Encouragement:**  
Would you like to revise one or two supporting sentences now, aiming for clear explanations and smooth transitions? You could try rewriting a sentence about how personal choices signal demand for green products, or a sentence about the challenge when few people participate.

Just choose a sentence or idea to improve, and I’ll help you polish it further!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:33:27.486Z

**You:** If I revised the paragraph I would say: On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, such as recycling, conserving water, or walking instead of driving. While less impactful than government policies, these actions still matter: they set a positive example for others and signal to companies that consumers demand eco-friendly products. For instance, when many people support sustainable businesses, those companies often adopt greener practices to remain profitable. However, this approach is limited when people prioritize convenience over environmental concerns. When only minority adopts these habits, their collective impact remains insufficient to meaningfully handle climate change.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:48:49.712Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your revision—your paragraph is much improved in unity and coherence! And great job balancing explanation, example, and addressing limitations.

Just as a reminder, I won’t rewrite full sentences for you, but I’ll guide you with focused comments and suggestions!

**What’s working well:**
- Your ideas all support your topic sentence: personal choices do matter, even if less than government action.
- You explain positive effects (example-setting, influencing companies).
- You also address limits (convenience, low participation).

**A few focused suggestions to strengthen your paragraph:**  

1. **Transitions for Coherence:**  
- Make sure transitions (“for instance,” “however,” “when only a minority...”) are clear and help the reader follow your logic.
- Do you want to connect your positive points and limitations more smoothly? For example, you might use “Nevertheless,” or “Despite these benefits...” to show contrast.

2. **Clarifying Evidence/Explanation:**  
- Would you like to expand slightly on **how** individuals signal demand to companies? How does consumer behavior actually encourage businesses to change?
- Is there any specific example you could briefly mention? (E.g., reusable bags, electric cars, eco-friendly products)

3. **Concluding Sentence:**  
- To emphasize your paragraph’s relevance, consider ending with a sentence showing why these actions, even if limited, remain important as part of the overall solution.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Would you like to try improving a transition between your example and the limitations?
- Can you clarify one explanation, such as how “sustainable businesses...adopt greener practices” in response to consumers?
- Is there a single sentence you could add at the end that reinforces the value of personal actions, even if small?

**Encouragement:**
Would you like to select one sentence to revise or add, using these ideas?  
You’re doing excellent work—one clear, expanded sentence or transition will make your paragraph even stronger!

Let me know which sentence or idea you want to work on next, and I’ll help you polish it!

*Time:* 2025-11-11T11:48:58.002Z

**You:** I am ready to revise the entire essay here is my proposition : "Climate change represents one of the most urgent challenges of our time, and many argue that individual actions pale in comparison to the influence of governments and corporations. While individual efforts alone cannot solve this crisis, citizens can drive meaningful progress both by pressuring governments to enact robust environmental policies and by adopting greener lifestyles that collectively shape market behaviour.

*Time:* 2025-11-11T12:08:59.828Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your revised essay draft! I’m impressed with your commitment to improving your academic writing, and your version shows much stronger structure and vocabulary. Before revising the entire essay, let's stick to the structured three-step revision process, focusing deeply on each essential part: thesis statement, one topic sentence, and the supporting sentences in that paragraph. This method encourages careful, targeted improvement.

---

**Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**

Your thesis statement is currently:

> “Climate change represents one of the most urgent challenges of our time, and many argue that individual actions pale in comparison to the influence of governments and corporations. While individual efforts alone cannot solve this crisis, citizens can drive meaningful progress both by pressuring governments to enact robust environmental policies and by adopting greener lifestyles that collectively shape market behaviour.”

**Feedback:**

- **Clarity:** Your thesis is very clear and shows your awareness of the topic. The contrast between individual actions and the power of governments/companies is explicit and answers the essay prompt directly.
- **Strength & Focus:** You use precise, confident language, and the main points (pressure on government, greener lifestyles) are clearly stated.
- **Preview of Structure:** Your thesis previews your two major arguments.

**Suggestions for Enhancement:**
- Consider briefly stating that individual actions are “secondary but still significant.” This would emphasize their supportive (not equal) role.
- The phrase "collectively shape market behaviour" is strong—could it be more explicit about how green lifestyles can impact businesses or companies?

**Guiding Question:**  
Would you like to refine your thesis further by adding a phrase that stresses the supporting (not primary) role of individual actions, or do you feel confident about your current version? Let me know if you’d like to adjust it, or if you are ready to move to Step 2!

---

**Step 2: Topic Sentence Revision**

Let’s confirm which body paragraph you'd like to work on. Previously, you selected the paragraph about personal green lifestyle changes.

**Current topic sentence:**

> “On the other hand, personal lifestyle changes such as recycling, conserving water, or reducing car use also play a meaningful, secondary, role.”

**Feedback:**

- **Connection to Thesis:** This topic sentence connects to your thesis and provides a clear transition from government action to individual choices.
- **Strength:** Adding "secondary" helps set up hierarchy between government and individual impacts.
- **Academic Tone:** Much improved.

**Suggestions for Enhancement:**
- Consider clarifying the significance even further: why is this secondary role still relevant? You might add a phrase such as "by establishing social norms and influencing consumer markets."
- Could you think about including a transition word like "Although" or "While" to contrast more sharply with the previous paragraph?

**Guiding Question:**  
Would you like to try revising this topic sentence to highlight the contrast and clarify the value of individual actions despite their lesser influence? Let me know your revision!

---

**Step 3: Revising Supporting Sentences in Chosen Paragraph**

Here are the supporting ideas you’ve used:

> "While less influential than government action, these choices set social precedents and signal consumer demand for sustainable products. When large numbers of citizens support eco-conscious businesses, companies often adopt greener practices to maintain profitability. Yet this strategy falters when convenience outweighs environmental concerns for most people, and when only a minority participates, the collective impact remains insufficient to meaningfully address the climate problem."

**Feedback and Guiding Questions:**

1. **Unity:** Each supporting sentence relates to your topic sentence about personal choices; nice job!
2. **Coherence & Flow:** Your paragraph moves smoothly from positive potential to limitations.
3. **Explanation:** Good job explaining HOW consumer choices influence companies. You might clarify with a brief example (reusable bags, electric cars, organic food) to make it more vivid.
4. **Transitions:** You use "while," "when," and "yet" well for contrast.

**Prompts for Improvement:**
- Would you like to add a sentence to explain exactly how consumers’ preference for green products has led to actual market changes (maybe mention an example)?  
- Could you clarify how insufficient participation limits the overall impact—even if many people take action, why might it “remain insufficient”?
- Would you like to finish with a sentence that restates why personal choices still add meaningful value, even if limited?

**Encouragement:**  
Would you like to revise one supporting sentence (for example, the one about consumer demand leading to company changes) or insert a real-world example to clarify your ideas further?  
Let me know which idea or sentence you want to work on next—you’re doing excellent, focused work!

**Final Reminder:**  
Keep your revisions targeted: thesis, topic sentence, supporting sentences (not the whole essay at once).  

Once you're happy with your revised paragraph, you can apply these techniques to the rest of your essay, but for now, let’s stay focused and make your chosen paragraph as strong, clear, and unified as possible!

**Assistant:** Excellent question! For your revision process **before submitting**, here is the validation checklist:

**You MUST validate each step in order:**  
1. **Thesis Statement Revision:**  
   - Confirm you are happy with your thesis statement and that it clearly answers the prompt, previews your main points, and uses confident, academic language.
   - Respond: “I am satisfied with my revised thesis” (or make final tweaks if needed).

2. **Topic Sentence Revision (chosen body paragraph):**  
   - Review your improved topic sentence for the selected paragraph.
   - Confirm it is clearly linked to your thesis, sets up the paragraph’s focus, and uses strong language.
   - Respond: “I am satisfied with my revised topic sentence.”

3. **Supporting Sentences in Paragraph Revision:**  
   - Review the supporting details and coherence in the paragraph.
   - Make sure transitions, evidence/examples, and explanations are unified and connected to your topic sentence.
   - Respond: “I am satisfied with my revised paragraph.”

**Validation Sequence:**  
You should validate each step (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph content) **in order**.  
**Do NOT submit** unless you’ve confirmed satisfaction with each.

**Summary Table for Validation:**

| Step                                    | Action Required                             |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1. Thesis Statement Revision             | Validate revision before going to Step 2    |
| 2. Topic Sentence Revision (chosen para) | Validate revision before Step 3             |
| 3. Paragraph Revision                    | Validate revision before final submission   |
