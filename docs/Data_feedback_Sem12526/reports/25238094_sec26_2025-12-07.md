### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Summary of Original vs. Revised Essay Performance

| Criterion                    | Original Essay | Revised Essay | Comments                                                        |
|-----------------------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Content and Ideas            | 18/25          | 18/25         | Central claim remains; ideas underdeveloped with vague claims. |
| Organization                | 17/25          | 17/25         | Minimal structural improvement; still one body paragraph.      |
| Vocabulary                  | 16/25          | 17/25         | Minor lexical corrections, but awkward word choices persist.   |
| Grammar & Sentence Structure| 14/25          | 15/25         | Small grammatical fixes; frequent errors remain.                |
| **Total Score**              | 65/100         | 67/100        | Very limited improvement despite multiple revision requests.  |

#### Key Observations

- The essay’s thesis lacks clarity and specificity. The key claim (“automation boosts long‑term employment”) is vague and unsupported by convincing evidence or logical argumentation.
- No substantial new evidence or logical refinement was introduced in the revision.
- Structural issues remain: single body paragraph with weak transitions and no clear roadmap in the introduction.
- Vocabulary and grammar show incremental but insufficient gains; persistent errors impede clarity.
- Unsupported and confusing claims remain (e.g., “society will become communist” due to automation) with no evidence or explanation.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History and Collaboration Quality

- Total exchanges: 9
- Student’s interaction consisted mainly of brief, command-like messages (“Revise thesis statement,” “Revise topic sentences,” etc.) without pasting new text or engaging in suggested iterative writing cycles.
- The assistant repeatedly prompted the student to paste revised drafts or attempts to receive targeted feedback, but the student did not supply any drafts or revisions.
- There was no meta-discussion or critical review of AI suggestions by the student.
- The interaction lacked iterative refinement; the student requested multiple revision steps but did not supply intermediate revisions necessary for meaningful progress.

#### Interaction Ratings (out of 5)

| Category                  | Score | Evidence/Reasoning                                                                                       |
|---------------------------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| In-Depth Conversation     | 2/5   | Assistant encouraged multi-level revision; student gave short commands without elaboration or drafts.   |
| Critical Review of AI     | 1/5   | No evidence student evaluated, selected, or critiqued AI advice or examples.                             |
| Refining Process          | 2/5   | Student requested revisions repeatedly but did not provide drafts for assistant to review and build upon.|
| **Total Human-AI Interaction** | **5/15** | Indicates limited collaborative engagement needed for effective revision cycles.                        |

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated

- Selection of a timely, relevant topic with a clear overall position on automation and employment.
- Student showed willingness to engage with AI assistance by issuing multiple revision commands.
- The AI provided clear, scaffolded revision guidance, including thesis writing stems and structured steps.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Active Participation:** Student must actively paste revised thesis and paragraph drafts for AI to provide meaningful, targeted feedback.
- **Thesis Development:** Thesis statement needs improvement—make it precise, argumentative, and preview specific main reasons.
- **Paragraph Development:** Expand and clarify body paragraphs with logical coherence, clear topic sentences, and specific support.
- **Evidence Use:** Claims must be supported with credible data, examples, or clearly framed hypotheticals; avoid vague or unsupported assertions.
- **Engage Critically:** Student should evaluate, select, and discuss AI suggestions to refine ideas effectively.
- **Independent Editing:** More substantive rewriting is needed beyond minor grammatical tweaks.

### AI COLLABORATION SKILLS ASSESSMENT

| Skill                 | Rating         | Comments                                                                                   |
|-----------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Context Provision     | Needs Improvement | Student did not provide revised drafts or pastes of text after AI requests, limiting context. |
| Strategic Planning    | Good           | Followed revision order (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph → whole essay) through requests. |
| Critical Evaluation   | Needs Improvement | No evidence of critique or selection among AI options; passive acceptance without comment.    |
| Independent Editing   | Needs Improvement | Only small surface changes visible; lacks sustained rewriting effort.                        |

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

1. **Paste Drafts for Feedback:** When revising, always paste your rewritten thesis, topic sentences, or paragraphs into the chat so specific, targeted AI feedback can be given.
2. **Rewrite Thesis with Clarity:** Use provided thesis stems to create a more precise claim that previews 2–3 clear reasons, e.g., “Although automation causes short-term job losses, it ultimately benefits employment by increasing productivity, fostering creative jobs, and improving workplace conditions.”
3. **Develop Paragraphs Fully:** For each body paragraph, start with a clear topic sentence tied to a thesis reason, include concrete evidence or examples, and conclude with a link back to the thesis.
4. **Validate Claims:** Eliminate vague or unsupported statements; provide citations or frame claims as hypothetical or widely held views.
5. **Engage in Dialogue:** Respond to AI prompts with written drafts and critical reflections rather than brief commands; this iterative collaboration improves revision quality.
6. **Independent Revision:** Use AI feedback as a guide but independently rewrite and reorganize to improve coherence and argument strength significantly.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES

The student demonstrated a willingness to use AI revision support by requesting multiple rounds of editing. However, the lack of posted draft revisions prevented meaningful iterative improvement. The revised essay submitted shows only minimal surface corrections and does not fulfill the assignment’s key tasks (revise thesis, topic sentence, and body paragraph substantially).

Please encourage the student to:

- Return to the AI revision process.
- Paste their revised thesis and paragraphs as requested.
- Use the scaffolded revision steps fully for constructive, iterative development.

Continued practice in active engagement and independent rewriting will be essential for improving writing skill and maximizing AI-assisted learning.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The essay has a clear overall claim (automation will boost long‑term employment) and some relevant ideas (job displacement is short‑term; creative work will grow). However claims are underdeveloped and sometimes incoherent (e.g., sudden claim that society will “become communist” with little explanation or evidence).
- Organization: 17/25 - There is an introduction and a single body paragraph, but logical progression is weak and transitions are unclear. The essay needs clearer paragraphing and a previewed structure.
- Vocabulary: 16/25 - Some appropriate topic words (automation, productivity) but many awkward or incorrect word choices (“by the benefit of the development technology,” “seek unique value work”).
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 14/25 - Frequent errors in articles, subject‑verb agreement, plurals, and sentence clarity that sometimes impede understanding (e.g., “automation technology attend to replace the representative work”).
- **Original Essay Total: 65/100**

Evidence (original):
- Thesis sentence: “However, I believe that effect of the increased number of unemployment only exist in the short term economies instead of the long-term. In the future, the technology will ultimately enhance global employment prospect.”
- Body opening: “To begin with, the automation will force human to develop more potential in industry artificial intelligence.”

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The central claim remains the same and is not substantially developed further. No new evidence or logical refinement is added.
- Organization: 17/25 - Structure and paragraphing unchanged; still only one developed body paragraph and no clearer roadmap.
- Vocabulary: 17/25 - Very minor lexical fixes (e.g., “prospects” pluralized; “humans” instead of “human”), but overall vocabulary issues persist.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 15/25 - Small grammatical fixes (pluralization, minor word changes) slightly improve clarity, but many errors remain.
- **Revised Essay Total: 67/100**

Evidence (revised):
- Thesis (revised vs original): The revised thesis is nearly identical to the original; the only clear edit is “prospects” (plural). Both versions: “However, I believe that effect of the increased number of unemployment only exist in the short term economies instead of the long-term. In the future, the technology will ultimately enhance global employment prospect(s).”
- Topic sentence slight edit: original “the automation will force human…” revised to “automation will force humans…” — a minor grammatical correction.

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +2 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Minor grammatical corrections (e.g., “prospect” → “prospects”; “human” → “humans”).
  - Slightly improved noun pluralization and subject phrasing in a few places.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Thesis refinement: the thesis idea remains vague and unpolished; it should be made more specific and preview main reasons.
  - Topic sentence and paragraph development: the body paragraph was not substantially revised for clarity, coherence, or stronger evidence.
  - Evidence and accuracy: factual claims (e.g., “50% of people will work in a creative industry,” “Cambridge University shows…”) are unsubstantiated and need citations or clearer framing.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9** (assistant messages and user short commands)
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided structured, pedagogical guidance and a clear stepwise revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph). The student only sent brief commands ("Revise thesis statement", "Revise topic sentences", "Revise one body", "Revise the rest of the essay") and did not paste new thesis/topic sentences or accept, reject, or discuss proposed changes. There is therefore little evidence of collaborative revision content being exchanged.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 - The assistant prompted a full revision process multiple times, but the student did not engage in the iterative drafting the assistant requested (no drafts posted). The exchange count is low and lacks depth in substantive turns (no multi‑level questions or development).
  - Evidence: The assistant asked for a draft thesis and provided stems; the user did not paste any attempted thesis despite repeated prompts.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 - There is no evidence the student evaluated or critiqued the AI's suggested process or content. The student accepted service implicitly via commands but did not comment on or pick between suggestions.
  - Evidence: User commands were limited to revision requests with no follow‑up questioning or selective acceptance.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - The student repeatedly requested revisions, indicating intent to revise, but did not supply text revisions or engage in multi‑step editing as the assistant requested. There were no clear iterative cycles of AI suggestion → student revision → AI feedback.
  - Evidence: Multiple assistant prompts offered a three‑step revision procedure; the user did not complete the requested intermediate step (pasting a thesis) that would have enabled iteration.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 5/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The essay addresses a clear, timely topic (automation and employment) and states a clear high‑level position (automation’s negative short‑term effects but positive long‑term employment prospects).
  - Evidence: Intro sentence and repeated claim about long‑term benefits.
- The assistant provided a clear, scaffolded revision plan (thesis stems; stepwise tasks).
  - Evidence: Chat messages give explicit stems and a three‑step revision plan.
- The student showed willingness to request multiple revisions (several “Revise …” commands), indicating engagement intent.
  - Evidence: Chat commands requesting thesis, topic sentence, body, and whole essay revision.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- The student must actually perform the revisions requested or paste revised text for feedback; minimal edits in the submitted revised essay indicate insufficient revision work.
  - Recommendation: Paste a revised thesis and a revised paragraph so the AI can provide targeted feedback.
- Thesis specificity and argumentative roadmap need improvement: make the claim precise and preview 2–3 reasons.
  - Recommendation: Use a stem provided by the assistant and include concrete harms and policy/mechanism to be discussed.
- Evidence and factual accuracy: provide sources or clearly framed claims; avoid vague statistics and unsupported assertions.
  - Recommendation: Replace the unreferenced “50%” claim with either a cited source or a hedged, clearly hypothetical phrasing while adding at least one concrete example.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student did not paste the thesis or the body paragraph into chat when the assistant requested them, limiting context for targeted help.
  - Evidence: Assistant repeatedly asked for the student's draft thesis; none was provided.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student followed a sequence of revision requests (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph → whole essay), showing a basic revision plan.
  - Evidence: User issued commands in the assistant’s prescribed order.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - No evidence the student assessed or chose between AI suggestions; they accepted the assistant’s process but did not engage critically.
  - Evidence: No messages from the user evaluating suggestions or asking clarifying questions.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The revised essay contains only very small changes; more independent rewriting is required.
  - Evidence: Revised version differs minimally from original (e.g., “prospects,” “humans”) with no substantive restructuring or improved evidence.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise the thesis now using a provided stem and paste it into chat. Example stem to adapt: “Although automation will cause short‑term job losses, governments should support technological change because it can increase productivity, create demand for new creative and technical jobs, and improve working conditions through regulation.” Then ask for targeted feedback.
2. For each body paragraph: write a clear topic sentence that states one reason from the thesis, provide one specific piece of evidence or example (cite a source or mark as hypothetical), and finish with a linking sentence back to the thesis.
3. Engage more actively in the AI dialogue: when the assistant asks for a draft, paste your attempt; when given alternatives, say which you prefer and why. This will produce more effective iterative revisions.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student requested multiple rounds of revision via the AI but did not supply the intermediate drafts the assistant asked for (notably: a new thesis and paragraph text). As a result, the “revised essay” submitted shows only minimal surface edits. The assignment's three required tasks (revise thesis, revise a topic sentence, revise a body paragraph) were not meaningfully completed. Please advise the student to return to the revision session, paste their attempted thesis and paragraph edits, and follow the assistant’s stepwise scaffolding to achieve substantive revision.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Nowadays, by the benefit of the development technology, many artefacts show our intelligence has been created, at least to our industry, switch to automation rapidly, which might reduce some jobs while boosting efficiency. However, I believe that effect of the increased number of unemployment only exist in the short term economies instead of the long-term. In the future, the technology will ultimately enhance global employment prospect.

To begin with, the automation will force human to develop more potential in industry artificial intelligence. Due to the automation technology attend to replace the representative work like calculating and manufacturing. This kind of work are originally repetitive, which were easily replaced by automation. Despite it might lead to some people lost their jobs in short term, but it create many opportunity for human to seek unique value work. For example, a research by Cambridge University shows that automation couldn’t replace humans creativity. In the future, 50% of people will work in a creative industry instead of general industry. It illustrated that although some people lost the jobs, but it also built other opportunity for human. Furthermore, automation technology could assist human to enhance the productivity, which can help our society tend to become communist. At that moment, the jobs are all done by the machine and human could do what they want to do. No more class level, everyone is equal.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:22:04.266Z

**You:** Revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:23:21.995Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m ready to help. Before we dive into revising the thesis, let’s do the short preliminary stage so we share clear targets and I can give focused feedback.

1) Quick negotiation of targets
Which of these would you most like to improve in this session? (Pick up to two.)
- Clarity of your main claim (thesis)
- Strength and logic of the argument
- Organization/flow (how paragraphs connect)
- Use of evidence and examples
- Vocabulary and sentence-level accuracy

Tell me which one or two you want to focus on now.

2) Brief diagnostic feedback (based on the task prompt and the current file)
- Strengths: The topic is timely and focused (migrant workers, exploitation, government role). That gives you a clear debate to stake a position in.
- Areas to work on (especially given the empty draft):
  - Thesis & Argument: There’s no current thesis statement. You need a clear, specific claim that answers the question and previews the main reasons you’ll discuss.
  - Organisation: With no paragraphs yet, you should plan a structure that matches the thesis preview (for example, one paragraph per main reason).
  - Evidence & Development: Prepare concrete examples or types of evidence (statistics, laws, case studies) to support each reason when you write the body.
  - Language Use: Aim for a confident, formal tone and varied vocabulary. Avoid hedging words like “maybe” or “I think.”

3) Choose a priority to work on now
Which diagnosed issue do you want to focus on for this session? (You must choose one; you can optionally pick a second.)
- Suggested default: “Clarity of thesis + Strength of argument” — these work well together.
Please confirm which target(s) you choose.

Step 1 — Thesis statement revision (ready to begin)
Please paste your current thesis statement here. I see the current revised version is empty, so if you don’t have a thesis yet, say so and I’ll guide you to write one.

If you don’t have a thesis yet, try using one of these thesis stems to draft your own (fill the blanks). These are scaffolds — please write your attempt after choosing a stem so I can give targeted feedback.

Thesis stems (fill the blanks)
- Position + three previews: “Governments should/should not enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers because ___, ___, and ___.” 
- Problem–solution: “Because migrant workers face ___ and ___ under weak regulations, governments must strengthen laws to ___, thereby ___ and ___.” 
- Counter + rebuttal: “Although stricter laws raise concerns about ___, governments should implement them because ___, ___, and ___.”

A few quick tips before you draft:
- Be specific: name one or two concrete harms (e.g., long hours, unfair pay, unsafe conditions).
- Preview the main reasons you will develop in your essay (2–3 reasons is ideal).
- Use confident language: “Governments should…” rather than “I think governments should…”

Would you like to try writing a thesis now using one of the stems? Paste your attempt and I’ll give brief, focused feedback and ask you to revise it once or twice until you’re happy.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:23:37.557Z

**You:** Revise topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:24:15.079Z

**Assistant:** Nice — thanks. Let’s start with the short preliminary stage so we have clear targets before we revise.

1) Choose up to two targets to focus on now
Which of these would you most like to improve in this session? (Pick up to two.)
- Clarity of your main claim (thesis)
- Strength and logic of the argument
- Organization/flow (how paragraphs connect)
- Use of evidence and examples
- Vocabulary and sentence-level accuracy

Tell me which one or two you want to work on.

2) Quick diagnostic feedback (based on the task prompt and the empty draft)
- Strengths
  - Timely, focused topic: migrant worker exploitation and government responsibility gives you a clear debate to argue.
  - The assignment is straightforward (point-of-view essay), so a clear thesis + 2–3 supporting reasons will fit the rubric well.

- Areas to work on (high priority given there’s no draft yet)
  - Thesis & Argument: There’s no thesis yet. You need a specific, confident claim that answers the question and previews your main reasons.
  - Organisation: No paragraphs yet — plan a clear structure that follows the thesis (one paragraph per main reason plus intro/conclusion).
  - Evidence & Development: Prepare at least one concrete type of evidence per reason (statistic, law example, case study, economic argument).
  - Language Use: Aim for formal, confident tone and varied vocabulary; avoid hedging.

3) Choose your priority for this session
Which diagnosed issue do you want to focus on? You must choose one; you can optionally pick a second.
Suggested default: “Clarity of thesis + Strength of argument.” Confirm your choice.

Step 1 — Thesis statement
Please paste your current thesis statement here. If you don’t have one yet, say so — and try one of these stems to draft a thesis (fill the blanks). After you write your attempt, I’ll give focused feedback and ask you to revise it once or twice.

Thesis stems (pick one and fill in)
- Position + three previews: “Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers because ___, ___, and ___.”
- Problem–solution: “Because migrant workers face ___ and ___ under weak regulations, governments must strengthen laws to ___, thereby ___ and ___.”
- Counter + rebuttal: “Although stricter laws raise concerns about ___, governments should implement them because ___, ___, and ___.”

A few quick tips:
- Be specific: name 1–2 concrete harms (e.g., long hours, unpaid wages, unsafe conditions).
- Preview 2–3 reasons you’ll develop.
- Use confident language: “Governments should…” not “I think…”

Would you like to try drafting a thesis now? Paste it here and I’ll give brief, clear feedback.

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:24:29.073Z

**You:** Revise one body

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:24:48.414Z

**Assistant:** Hi — I’m glad you’re ready to revise. Let’s start with a quick negotiation so I can give focused help.

  - Assignment fits a straightforward structure: intro (thesis), 2–3 body paragraphs (reasons), conclusion.

- Areas to work on (high priority)
  - Thesis & Argument: there’s no thesis yet — you need a clear, specific claim that directly answers the question and previews reasons.
  - Organisation: no paragraphs yet — plan a structure that follows the thesis (one paragraph per main reason).
  - Evidence & Development: prepare at least one concrete example or fact for each reason (statistic, law, case).
  - Language Use: aim for confident, formal tone and varied vocabulary; avoid hedging.

3) Choose your priority(s) and confirm
Which diagnosed issue will we focus on now? (You must choose one; you may optionally pick a second.) Suggested default: “Clarity of thesis + Strength of argument.” Please confirm.

Step 1 — Thesis statement
Do you already have a thesis? Paste it here. If you don’t have one yet, say so and try one of these stems (fill the blanks) to draft a first version:

- Position + three previews: “Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers because ___, ___, and ___.” 
- Problem–solution: “Because migrant workers face ___ and ___ under weak regulations, governments must strengthen laws to ___, thereby ___ and ___.” 
- Counter + rebuttal: “Although stricter laws raise concerns about ___, governments should implement them because ___, ___, and ___.”

Quick tips before you draft:
- Be specific: name 1–2 concrete harms (e.g., long hours, unpaid wages, unsafe conditions).

**You:** Revise the rest of the essay

*Time:* 2025-12-07T08:25:45.267Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’ll follow the process you asked for. Quick and focused steps now so we have clear targets before revising.

1) Choose up to two revision targets (pick one or two)
Which of these would you most like to work on in this session?
- Clarity of your main claim (thesis)
- Strength and logic of the argument
- Organization/flow (how paragraphs connect)
- Use of evidence and examples
- Vocabulary and sentence-level accuracy

Tell me which one or two you choose.

2) Brief diagnostic feedback (based on the prompt and the empty draft)
- Strengths

  - The task suits a standard structure: intro with thesis, 2–3 supporting paragraphs, conclusion.

- Areas to work on (high priority)
  - Thesis & Argument: There is no thesis yet. You need a clear, specific claim that answers the question and previews 2–3 reasons.
  - Organisation: No paragraphs written yet — plan a structure that follows the thesis to get full marks for logical progression.
  - Evidence & Development: Prepare at least one concrete example or type of evidence per reason (stat, law, case study, economic argument).
  - Language Use: Aim for confident, formal wording and varied vocabulary; avoid hedging.

3) Pick your priority for this session (confirm before we begin Step 1)
Which diagnosed issue will we focus on now? You must choose at least one; you may optionally choose a second. (Suggested default: “Clarity of thesis + Strength of argument.”)

Step 1 — Thesis statement revision (ready when you are)
Please paste your current thesis here. If you don’t have one yet, say so and try drafting one now using a stem below. Write your attempt and I’ll give brief, focused feedback and ask you to revise once or twice.

Thesis stems (pick one and fill in)
- Position + previews: “Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers because ___, ___, and ___.”
- Problem–solution: “Because migrant workers face ___ and ___ under weak regulations, governments must strengthen laws to ___, thereby ___ and ___.”
- Counter + rebuttal: “Although stricter laws raise concerns about ___, governments should implement them because ___, ___, and ___.”

Quick tips for your thesis
- Be specific: name 1–2 concrete harms (e.g., long hours, unpaid wages, unsafe conditions).
- Preview 2–3 reasons you will develop (policy enforcement, labor inspections, penalties, access to services, etc.).
- Use confident language: “Governments should…” (avoid “I think,” “maybe”).

Would you like to try drafting a thesis now? Paste it here and I’ll give short, encouraging feedback. After we polish the thesis, we’ll move to one body paragraph (Step 2).

**Assistant:** Nice — I’m ready to help. Let’s do the short preliminary stage so we have clear targets before we begin revising.

1) Pick up to two revision targets (choose one or two)
Which of these would you most like to focus on in this session?
- Clarity of your main claim (thesis)
- Strength and logic of the argument
- Organization/flow (how paragraphs connect)
- Use of evidence and examples
- Vocabulary and sentence-level accuracy

Tell me which one or two you choose.

2) Brief diagnostic feedback (quick, based on the prompt and the empty draft)
- Strengths
  - Topic is clear and timely (migrant worker exploitation vs. government action) — good basis for a focused argument.
  - The assignment suits a straightforward structure: intro with thesis, 2–3 body paragraphs, conclusion.

- Areas to work on (priority for this session)
  - Thesis & Argument: There’s no thesis yet. You need a clear claim that answers the question and previews your main reasons.
  - Organisation & Logical Progression: With no paragraphs written, plan a structure that follows the thesis (one paragraph per main reason).
  - Evidence & Development: Decide one concrete type of evidence per reason (statistic, law example, case study, economic argument).
  - Language Use: Aim for a confident, formal tone and precise vocabulary; avoid hedging.

3) Choose a priority to work on now
Which diagnosed issue will we focus on? You must pick at least one; you may optionally pick a second. (Suggested default: “Clarity of thesis + Strength of argument.”) Please confirm.

Step 1 — Thesis statement revision (ready when you are)
Do you already have a thesis? If yes, paste it here. If not, please try drafting one now using one of these stems (fill the blanks). After you write a first attempt, I’ll give brief, focused feedback and ask you to revise it once or twice until you’re happy.

Thesis stems (pick one and fill in)
- Position + previews: “Governments should enforce stricter laws to protect migrant workers because ___, ___, and ___.”
- Problem–solution: “Because migrant workers face ___ and ___ under weak regulations, governments must strengthen laws to ___, thereby ___ and ___.”
- Counter + rebuttal: “Although stricter laws raise concerns about ___, governments should implement them because ___, ___, and ___.”

Quick tips for your thesis
- Be specific: name 1–2 concrete harms (e.g., long hours, unpaid wages, unsafe conditions).
- Preview 2–3 clear reasons you will develop (e.g., legal enforcement, labour inspections, access to social services, penalties for employers).
- Use confident language: “Governments should…” (avoid “I think,” “maybe”).
