            ## Contribution Analysis

            ### Summary of Student Performance and Recommendations Based on Chat History

---

#### Observations:

- The student was able to identify and share their thesis statement multiple times.
- However, they repeatedly submitted almost the exact original thesis statement without noticeable revision.
- When prompted to rewrite it in a more confident and structured way, the student did not produce a new version despite encouragement and examples.
- Instead, the student shifted focus by submitting what appears to be their conclusion paragraph rather than working on the thesis statement revision.
- The student’s engagement remained at recognition and restatement rather than active revision and implementation of AI guidance.

---

#### Key Issues Noted:

- **No meaningful revision:** The student did not rewrite the thesis statement to address clarity, confidence, or preview of main points as advised.
- **Avoidance of revision tasks:** Despite multiple prompts, the student continued to post the original thesis or unrelated concluding paragraphs.
- **Minimal critical engagement:** The student did not reflect on the AI feedback or iterate their work.
- **Early drafting stage:** The work is not yet ready for rubric-grade assessment as key revision steps remain incomplete.

---

#### Recommendations to Support Improvement:

1. **Explicit Task Focus:** Clarify that the goal of the task is to rewrite the thesis statement (not conclusion) with confidence and preview of main points. Suggest the student draft just one sentence at a time and explain why they chose their wording.
2. **Scaffolded Examples:** Provide step-by-step examples with fill-in-the-blank templates so the student can practice more easily.
3. **Encourage Reflection:** Ask the student to state what was changed and why after each revision attempt, fostering deeper engagement with AI feedback.
4. **Gradual Progression:** Once the thesis revision is demonstrated, prompt the student to move systematically through revising topic sentences and body paragraphs.
5. **Motivation:** Gently encourage the importance of actively trying new drafts and how iterative revisions improve quality, stressing no “perfect first draft” expected.

---

Please ensure the student attempts **at least one clear, revised thesis statement** that:

- Answers the essay question confidently,
- Mentions both key points (influencing governments and personal lifestyle choices),
- Avoids uncertain language like “I partly agree” or “I think.”

This is essential before advancing in the training.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:39:31.964Z

**You:** partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:43:14.544Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s start with **Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision.**

Please share your current thesis statement.  
I see you wrote:  
> I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

Here are some feedback points to help make it stronger:

**Clarity**: Your thesis is mostly clear, but it could more directly answer the essay question about individual actions versus government/company actions.

**Focus & Preview**: Try to briefly mention your two main ideas—citizen influence on governments and personal lifestyle choices—so your reader knows how your essay will be organized.

**Language**: Avoid phrases like “I partly agree,” which sound a bit uncertain. Instead, use more confident language.

**Structure Example** (for guidance only – please try revising yourself):
- State your overall opinion confidently, then mention your two main points.

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement again! 

Let’s work together to strengthen it using the feedback above. Here are a few guiding questions to help you revise:

1. Can you start with a clear, direct answer—do you believe individuals matter or not in the fight against climate change?
2. Can you briefly mention the two main points you will discuss (influence on government AND personal choices)?
3. Can you use confident, precise language and avoid “I partly agree” or “I think”?

Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now? If you’re unsure, you could start by rewriting the first part of the sentence confidently. 

Feel free to post your revision when ready, and we’ll look at it together!

**You:** Fpartly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:56:59.034Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your thesis statement again!

Let’s take a look together:

> "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

**Feedback:**
- Your thesis mentions both main points (government influence and personal lifestyle).
- However, it starts with "I partly agree," which sounds less confident and isn’t a direct answer to the essay question.
- Try to be clear: Should individuals’ actions be considered important or not?
- Preview both points in a direct way, showing what your essay will focus on.
- Use confident, precise language.

**Guiding Prompt:**
How about starting with a sentence that clearly states your view on the role of individual actions in climate change, and then mentioning both main arguments you’ll develop?

Would you like to try revising it so it sounds more decisive and previews your essay’s structure? For example, you could use phrasing like:  
"Although individuals may not have as much impact as governments or companies, their actions—especially in influencing policy and making personal lifestyle choices—remain valuable in addressing climate change."

**But please try writing your own revision first!**  
Whenever you’re ready, post your revised thesis and I’ll give you feedback.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:57:02.004Z

**You:** For me,I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:57:32.611Z

**Assistant:** Thank you so much for sharing your revised thesis statement again! I see you’re using:  

> For me, I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

You’ve clearly included your two main points, which is great! Here are some quick feedback notes to help your thesis become even stronger:

**Strengths:**
- You mention both key arguments (influencing government and personal choices).
- You show understanding of the topic and both sides.

**Suggestions for revision:**
1. Try to avoid “For me,” “I partly agree,” or “I also think”—these weaken the statement. Aim for a more confident tone!
2. Combine your ideas more concisely. A strong thesis is often one clear, direct sentence.
3. Make your own viewpoint clear: Are individual actions important, and in what ways?
4. Briefly hint at the structure (government influence AND lifestyle choices).

Here are some **helpful prompts** you could try (please do not copy, but use them to inspire your revision):

- “Individual actions may be less powerful than those of governments and companies, but __________ and __________ make them important in the fight against climate change.”
- “While governments and companies play the biggest roles, individuals are crucial because of their influence on policy and their personal environmental choices.”
- “Despite the greater impact of large organizations, individuals contribute to climate change solutions by pressuring governments and adopting greener lifestyles.”

**Would you like to try writing your own decisive thesis statement now, avoiding phrases like ‘I partly agree’ or ‘I also think’?**  
Remember:  
- Start confidently.
- Briefly mention “influencing government” AND “lifestyle choices”.

Share your new version here, and let’s keep moving!

*Time:* 2025-11-13T06:57:39.382Z

**You:** In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T07:17:19.815Z

**Assistant:** Great job engaging with the revision process so far!

Let’s focus in on your **thesis statement** before we move forward.

Your latest thesis statement is:

> In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Feedback:**
- This is actually a concluding paragraph, not a thesis statement.
- Remember: the thesis goes at the end of your introduction and should **confidently state your main opinion and preview the structure of your essay**.
- The thesis should clearly answer: What is your position on the importance of individual actions versus governmental/corporate actions on climate change? Also, what are the main points you’ll discuss?

**Let’s Try Again:**
- Begin with a confident answer to the essay’s main question.
- Briefly mention both the role of influencing government and lifestyle choices.

**Would you like to try writing a thesis statement here (just one or two sentences) that meets these goals?**

You could follow this model:
- “Although individual actions are less impactful than those of governments and companies, they are still important in the fight against climate change due to citizens’ ability to influence political decisions and the positive example set by personal green lifestyle choices.”

**But please write your own version!**  
Post just your thesis statement now, and we’ll check if it’s focused, confident, and effective before moving to Step 2. 

Let me know if you’d like further hints or examples!
