            ## Contribution Analysis

            It looks like you have identified the thesis statement as requested, which is a good first step. However, you haven’t yet submitted a revised version based on the feedback provided. To move forward and complete the training task successfully, I recommend trying the following:

1. **Revise your thesis statement** to make it clearer and more confident. For example, instead of “I partly agree,” you could say “Both government action and individual choices are essential in combating climate change.”  
2. **Make sure the thesis previews your two main points** (influencing government and personal lifestyle choices) in a concise, strong way.  
3. After revising, share your new thesis statement here so we can discuss and improve it further.

Once you complete this step, we can proceed to revising a topic sentence and a body paragraph. This iterative process will help build your revision skills and complete your training.

Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now? If you want, I can help you by giving a model revision first—just ask!

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student has not yet demonstrated full engagement with the training task. Recommend targeted follow-up to encourage completion of revision steps and promote active collaboration with AI guidance.
- Additional support may be required to build confidence in revision and critical review stages.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-13T01:48:04.342Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-13T02:03:05.581Z

**Assistant:** Great! Let’s start the revision process together.  
**Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision**

Thank you for sharing your current thesis statement:

*I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.*

Here are some feedback points to help you strengthen it:

- **Clarity:** Your position is clear (“partly agree”), but the sentence is a bit long and complex. Consider making it more direct.
- **Strength:** Words like “I believe” and “I also think” can make your thesis sound less confident. Try to use more decisive language.
- **Focus:** Summarizing your two main arguments briefly (influencing government and individual lifestyle choices) is good, but you can also indicate that both are necessary or mention which is more important.

**A strong thesis should:**
1. Directly answer the essay question (“Do individuals matter as much as governments/companies?”)
2. Preview your main points (influencing government, personal lifestyle choices)
3. Use confident, precise language (avoid “I think,” “maybe,” “I believe”)

**Here are some guiding prompts:**
- How could you express your position without phrases like “I believe”?  
- Can you use words like “crucial,” “significant,” or “essential” to show emphasis?
- Do you want to state which factor is more impactful, or do you want to show balance between the two?

Would you like to try revising your thesis statement now, based on this feedback? I’m happy to review your new version!
