### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- **Content and Ideas:** 19/25  
  *Justification:* The essay addresses the exploitation of migrant workers and calls for stricter government regulation. Key ideas are thematically relevant, but development is uneven and lacks some analytical depth—ideas are presented in basic terms with limited critical analysis.
- **Organization:** 16/25  
  *Justification:* The essay follows a general introduction-body-conclusion structure, but paragraphing is weak, topic sentences are unclear, and transitions are limited. Logical progression is affected by repetition and lack of unity.
- **Vocabulary:** 16/25  
  *Justification:* Range is limited. Frequent word choice errors (“exploitaten,” “norkers,” “guaranteed and certified”) and repetition. Some thematic vocabulary present, but precision and accuracy need improvement.
- **Grammar and Sentence Structure:** 15/25  
  *Justification:* Frequent problems with subject-verb agreement (“migrants workers,” “is working”), article use, spelling, and word order. Sentence fragments/significant run-ons affect clarity.
- **Original Essay Total:** **66/100**

---

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- **Content and Ideas:** 23/25  
  *Justification:* Ideas are now clearly stated, expanded, and more relevant to the thesis; analysis links exploitation factors to policy recommendations, with a stronger sense of urgency and solution-focused argument.
- **Organization:** 23/25  
  *Justification:* Paragraphs have clear topic sentences and supporting details; logical flow is much improved, with transitions and unity in each section, especially introduction and conclusion.
- **Vocabulary:** 22/25  
  *Justification:* Word choice is much more accurate and specific to topic (“exploitation,” “minimum wage,” “ethical conditions,” “certified as exploitation-free”). Minor slips remain but no major confusion.
- **Grammar and Sentence Structure:** 21/25  
  *Justification:* Sentence structure has improved greatly; most key sentences are accurate, some complex sentences are used, occasional small grammar errors (“panelties”/“penalties,” article use), but clarity is consistently high.
- **Revised Essay Total:** **89/100**

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Migrants workers are now facing exploitaten that affects their life seriously. The goverments should enforce stricter laws
and regulations to safeguard their human rights.
Many factories preferring to employ migrants norkers as there are inadequate local labour willing to work in production factories. Especially developed nations such as The United Stated, the majority of educated local people is working in the company that can earn higher salary instead of working in factories that only can earn lower salary. Meanwhile, many uneducated migrants who are seeking
jobs to stay afloat had been most of factories ‘ target.

However, many migrants workers are facing significant exploitation in the factories that affect their physical and mental health. For instance, migrants workers have to work in poor conditions like extreme temperature without taking break. Although they work for  long hours, their salary are still lower than the average, even are not sufficient to meet their basic needs, they may feel depressed and anxious if not working hard at all the times. It is obvious that, their human rights are exploited that without any fair pay and compensation, which affect their health and well-being seriously.

It is believed that the problem will be more serious due to weak regulation. Unless government enforce stricter regulations, most of the company that operating production chain will continue to exploit migrant workers’ rights.

It is suggested that the government should implement a set of policy to protect migrant workers’ human rights and compensation. Ensuring they have fair pay that only accept selling the products that made in an ethical producing process. The regulation is that companies must guaranteed and certified the products are made from the workers who are safeguarded and fair payed.

To sum up, government is the most important role to support the migrant workers and protecting their human rights.

Revised:
Migrant workers are now facing exploitation that affects their lives seriously. The governments should enforce stricter laws and regulations to protect their human rights and stop the abuse by ensuring fair pay and fair compensation.
Many factories prefer to employ migrant workers as there is inadequate local labour willing to work in low-paid production jobs , creating a situation where exploitation is common. In developed countries like the United States, most educated local people choose better paying jobs instead of hard and low paying factory work. Employers know that migrant workers have limited choices and are powerless , often offering low wages and harsh conditions. As a result,exploitation is widespread and serious. Stricter laws are necessary to protect their rights from such abuse.
However, many migrant workers are facing significant exploitation in the factories that affect their physical and mental health. For instance, migrant workers have to work in dangerous conditions like extreme temperatures without taking breaks or safety protection. Although they work for  long hours, their wages are still lower than the average, and are not sufficient to meet their basic needs. They may feel depressed and anxious if not working hard at all times. It is obvious that their basic human rights are being violated through unfair pay, lack of rest, and unsafe workplaces. 
It is believed that the problem will be serious due to weak regulation. Unless the government enforces stricter regulations, offer fair pay and fair compensation, the exploitation will worsen. Most companies will continue to ignore migrant workers’ rights and focus on lowering the costs .
It is suggested that the government should implement a set of policies to protect migrant workers’ human rights and compensation. Require companies to prove their products are made in ethical conditions .Only allow selling the products certified as “exploitation-free,” and proof of fair wages ,fair compensation and safe conditions. Otherwise, they should face panelties. Also, government should set a minimum wage for migrant workers to force companies to offer a fair wage for workers.
To sum up, government plays the most important role in supporting the migrant workers and protecting their human rights.Governments should enforce strict minimum wages and punish abusers severely. It is believed that those actions will end the injustice against migrant workers.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-20T02:53:28.029Z

**You:** I want to improve organization and grammar

*Time:* 2025-11-20T02:56:00.766Z

**Assistant:** Thank you for sharing your goals and the essay draft! Let’s start our structured revision process step by step:

---

**Preliminary Stage — Negotiating Targets and Diagnosing the Essay**

**1. Negotiate Targets**

You told me you want to improve:  
- **Organization**  
- **Grammar**

Is that right? Is there anything you’d like to add or focus on in particular within those areas (such as paragraph structure or sentence clarity)?  
*Please confirm or clarify your targets before we move to the next step!*

**2. Diagnostic Feedback (Based on Rubric)**

Here’s my brief diagnosis, looking at your draft and our rubric:

- **Content & Ideas:** Your essay is relevant and covers the issue well. Your viewpoint is present but could be developed with more clarity and depth.
- **Organization & Logical Progression:** The essay structure is present (introduction, body, conclusion) but some paragraphs need clearer topic sentences and logical transitions.
- **Vocabulary:** There are some errors and repetition. Most words are adequate for the topic.
- **Grammar & Sentence Structure:** There are frequent errors (e.g., verb tense, agreement, spelling). Some sentences are confusing or incomplete.

**Strengths:**  
- Good awareness of the issue.
- Your main ideas are relevant to the topic.

**Areas to Improve (matching your focus):**  
- Paragraph organization (stronger topic sentences, unity, transitions)  
- Grammar (sentence structure, verb agreement, spelling, clarity)

**3. Student Priority Selection**

You said you want to focus on **organization and grammar**.  
Would you like to focus more on paragraph structure (topic sentences, transitions) or on sentence-level grammar first?  
Or should we balance both as we go?

*Please let me know your preferred focus within "organization and grammar" or confirm that we're ready to begin!*

---

**Once you confirm, I’ll start Step 1: Thesis Statement Revision.**

*Time:* 2025-11-20T02:56:06.877Z

**You:** we balance both

*Time:* 2025-11-20T02:57:15.026Z

**Assistant:** Great! Thanks for confirming—we’ll balance both **organization** and **grammar** as we work through the revision steps. Our focus will be on:

- Improving paragraph structure and logical flow (organization)
- Fixing grammar, spelling, and sentence clarity (grammar)

Let’s begin the structured revision!

---

### **Step 1 — Thesis Statement Revision**

**Your current thesis statement:**  
Migrants workers are now facing exploitaten that affects their life seriously. The goverments should enforce stricter laws and regulations to safeguard their human rights.

**Feedback:**
- **Clarity:** There are some spelling errors (“exploitaten” should be “exploitation”; “migrants workers” should be “migrant workers”; “goverments” should be “governments”).
- **Strength & Focus:** It clearly states the problem and the solution, but the sentence could be stronger and more precise.
- **Preview:** It doesn’t quite preview the main points you will cover in your essay.

**Suggestions for improvement:**
- Make sure your thesis clearly answers the essay question.
- Preview the main arguments (e.g., how exploitation happens, why stricter laws are needed, role of government).
- Use confident language, no hedging.

**Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement now, or would you like a hint or example first?**  
If you want a hint, you could try this structure:  
*“Because migrant workers are facing serious exploitation, governments must enforce stricter laws to protect their rights by improving working conditions and ensuring fair pay.”*

Once you update your thesis, please share it here, and we’ll keep moving forward!

---

*Take your time. Let me know your revised thesis statement, and I’ll help you refine it if needed!*

*Time:* 2025-11-20T02:57:20.254Z

**You:** Migrant workers are now facing exploitation that affects their life seriously. The governments should enforce stricter laws and regulations to protect their human rights and stop the abuse by ensuring fair pay and fair compensation.

*Time:* 2025-11-20T03:05:25.847Z

**Assistant:** Excellent job! Your revised thesis is much clearer—you corrected the main errors and added more focus to “fair pay” and “fair compensation.” Let’s look at how it matches our goals for **organization** and **grammar**:

**Your revised thesis:**  
Migrant workers are now facing exploitation that affects their life seriously. The governments should enforce stricter laws and regulations to protect their human rights and stop the abuse by ensuring fair pay and fair compensation.

**Quick feedback:**

- **Clarity:** Much improved. “Migrant workers” and “exploitation” are correct.
- **Strength:** Confident language.
- **Focus:** Specifies the need for laws, human rights protection, and fair pay/compensation.
- **Preview of Main Points:** Mentions two main solutions—protecting rights and fair pay/compensation.

**Final touch for grammar and sentence structure:**
- “Their life” → “their lives”
- Combining the sentence for stronger thesis unity.

**Here’s a suggested revision (not a requirement):**  
Migrant workers are now facing serious exploitation that affects their lives. Governments should enforce stricter laws and regulations to protect their human rights and stop abuse by ensuring fair pay and compensation.

**Would you like to try combining your ideas into one sentence for a smoother thesis?**  
Or, are you happy with how it is now?

*Let me know if you want to revise it further. If you’re satisfied, we’ll move on to Step 2—Topic Sentence Revision!*

*Time:* 2025-11-20T03:05:30.713Z

**You:** Let’s move on to step 2

*Time:* 2025-11-20T03:07:01.580Z

**Assistant:** ### **Step 2 — Topic Sentence Revision**

Now, let’s choose **one body paragraph** to work on.  
Would you like to focus on your first full body paragraph (about why factories employ migrant workers and the situation in developed nations), or on the second (details about exploitation affecting health and pay)?

**Let’s use your first body paragraph for this revision:**

**Current topic sentence of the first body paragraph:**  
Many factories preferring to employ migrants norkers as there are inadequate local labour willing to work in production factories.

**Feedback:**
- **Grammar:** Needs correction ("preferring" should be "prefer", "migrants norkers" should be "migrant workers", "labour" is correct British spelling, but the whole clause needs revision).
- **Connection to thesis:** The sentence should clearly connect to your thesis, showing why exploitation happens (e.g., through employment trends or the demand for migrant workers).
- **Clarity & Focus:** Needs to state the main idea of the paragraph confidently.

**Model/Hints:**  
A strong topic sentence might look like:  
*"Many factories prefer to employ migrant workers because there are not enough local people willing to work in low-paid production jobs."*

Or, to connect more directly to your revised thesis:  
*"Factories often hire migrant workers due to a shortage of local labor, but this high demand can lead to increased exploitation."*

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence now?**  
You can use the hints above or write your own version!

---

*When you’re ready, share your revised topic sentence and we’ll review it together before moving to step 3!*

*Time:* 2025-11-20T03:07:05.519Z

**You:** Many factories prefer to employ migrant workers as there is inadequate local labour willing to work in low-paid production jobs .Meanwhile, they know migrant workers have few choices, so factories pay very little.

*Time:* 2025-11-20T03:16:50.693Z

**Assistant:** Excellent effort! You’ve revised your topic sentence to be much clearer and better connected to your thesis. Let’s review your version:

**Your revised topic sentence:**
> Many factories prefer to employ migrant workers as there is inadequate local labour willing to work in low-paid production jobs. Meanwhile, they know migrant workers have few choices, so factories pay very little.

**Feedback:**

- **Strengths:**  
  - You clearly explain why factories employ migrant workers (shortage of local labor, low-paid jobs).
  - You relate this directly to exploitation (factories pay less because migrants have few choices).
- **Grammar & Sentence Clarity:**  
  - Solid improvements!  
  - Small grammar point: Instead of “inadequate local labour,” you could say “there is not enough local labor.”  
  - Combining into one clear topic sentence would strengthen paragraph unity.

**Revision suggestion for unity and clarity (try editing this yourself):**  
“Many factories prefer to employ migrant workers because there are not enough local people willing to work in low-paid production jobs, and employers know that migrants have few choices, so they pay them very little.”

**Would you like to try combining your ideas into one strong topic sentence?  
Or, are you happy with your current version?**

If you’re ready, let’s move on to Step 3: revising the rest of the paragraph.

---

## **Step 3 — Revising the Rest of Your Chosen Paragraph**

Here’s the current body paragraph after your topic sentence:

> Many factories prefer to employ migrant workers as there is inadequate local labour willing to work in low-paid production jobs. Meanwhile, they know migrant workers have few choices, so factories pay very little. Especially developed nations such as The United Stated, the majority of educated local people is working in the company that can earn higher salary instead of working in factories that only can earn lower salary. Meanwhile, many uneducated migrants who are seeking jobs to stay afloat had been most of factories’ target.

**Let’s improve:**
- **Grammar:** Watch out for verb tense, agreement, and word order.
- **Clarity:** Make sure every sentence directly supports your topic sentence.
- **Unity:** Remove repetition and stay focused on one idea per sentence.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Do your details clearly explain *why* migrants get exploited?
- Is each sentence clear and connected?
- Can you join short, choppy sentences for smoother flow?

**Try revising these sentences so the logic and grammar are clear. For example:**

- “In developed nations such as the United States, most educated local people work in companies that offer higher salaries, while factories offer lower wages.”
- “Because of this, many migrants who lack education and need jobs become the main targets for factory employment.”

Would you like to try rewriting these two sentences on your own, using the hints above?  
Let me know your revised versions, and I’ll give feedback!

---

When you’re ready, please post your full revised body paragraph (including your improved topic sentence and supporting sentences). I will give you encouragement and focused feedback to help you polish it further!

**Current Fully Revised Essay (so far):**

> Migrant workers are now facing serious exploitation that affects their lives. Governments should enforce stricter laws and regulations to protect their human rights and stop abuse by ensuring fair pay and compensation.

> Many factories prefer to employ migrant workers because there are not enough local people willing to work in low-paid production jobs, and employers know that migrants have few choices, so they pay them very little. In developed nations such as the United States, most educated local people work in companies that offer higher salaries, while factories offer lower wages. As a result, many migrants who lack education and need jobs become the main targets for factory employment.

**Great work! Take your time and let me know if you need a hint or want to try drafting the next sentences yourself.**

*Time:* 2025-11-20T03:16:59.671Z

**You:** How can I improve the content, make it more relevant to thesis statements

*Time:* 2025-11-20T03:19:45.508Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let’s focus on making your **body paragraph content** more relevant and tightly connected to your thesis statement, so your essay is organized and your argument is strong.

### **How to Improve Content Relevance to the Thesis**

Your **thesis statement** (revised):
> Migrant workers are now facing serious exploitation that affects their lives. Governments should enforce stricter laws and regulations to protect their human rights and stop abuse by ensuring fair pay and compensation.

**What does your thesis promise?**
- Migrant workers are exploited.
- Governments must act (laws, human rights, fair pay, compensation).

**Your first body paragraph should:**
- **Show why migrant workers end up in exploitative jobs.**
- **Explain how employment trends lead to the exploitation problem.**
- **Set up WHY government action is needed (connect cause to solution).**

---

### **Revision Strategies and Guiding Questions**

Ask yourself:
- Does every sentence help explain *why* exploitation happens, or how?
- Are you linking facts about factory demand and local workers to the exploitation problem?
- Do you mention why laws/regulation matter, or set up the next argument?

#### **Here’s a model structure for your body paragraph:**

1. **Topic Sentence (clear connection to thesis):**
    - *Factories often employ migrant workers because there is a shortage of locals willing to take low-paid jobs, creating a situation where exploitation is common.*

2. **Supporting Idea 1:**
    - *Explain the circumstances (developed countries, educated people choose better-paying jobs).*

3. **Supporting Idea 2:**
    - *Describe what happens to migrants (they accept low pay, few choices, targeted by factories).*

4. **Supporting Idea 3 (direct link to thesis):**
    - *This unequal situation allows employers to ignore workers’ rights, showing why government action is needed.*

#### **Model example (for inspiration, not copying):**
> Many factories prefer to hire migrant workers because there are not enough local employees willing to work in low-paid, difficult jobs. In rich countries like the United States, most local workers are highly educated and can find better jobs outside factories. As a result, factories target migrants who have limited options and urgently need work, often offering poor wages and harsh conditions. This demand for cheap labor creates the perfect conditions for exploitation—showing why strong laws are necessary to protect workers’ rights.

---

### **Your Turn: Add Relevant Content**
Try to revise your body paragraph so it:
- Explains the link between employment patterns and exploitation.
- Sets up the need for government protection (as promised in your thesis).
- Uses clear and logical sentences.

You could add a *final sentence* like:
> This cycle of unfair treatment will continue unless governments set stricter rules to protect migrant workers.

---

**Would you like to try rewriting the full body paragraph (using your ideas + the structure above)?**

Or would you prefer a sentence-by-sentence approach with guided prompts?

Let me know how you’d like to proceed—or post your revised paragraph and I’ll give focused, encouraging feedback!

---

**Remember:**  
- Every detail should support your thesis argument.  
- Explain “why” and “how” exploitation happens—not just “what.”  
- End the paragraph linking back to government responsibility.

**Ready to try?** Would you like a prompt for your next sentence, or do you want to write your own first draft?

I’m here to guide you step-by-step!

**A few small suggestions for grammar/clarity:**
- “Meanwhile, they know migrant workers have limited choices and are powerless, often offering low wages and harsh conditions.”  
  Could be made clearer by specifying “employers” rather than “they.”
- A comma after “As a result,” for smooth reading.

**Here’s the paragraph with suggested minor edits (for your review):**

> Many factories prefer to employ migrant workers as there is inadequate local labour willing to work in low-paid production jobs, creating a situation where exploitation is common. In developed countries like the United States, most educated local people choose better-paying jobs instead of hard and low-paying factory work. Employers know that migrant workers have limited choices and are powerless, so they often offer low wages and harsh conditions. As a result, exploitation is widespread and serious. Stricter laws are necessary to protect their rights from such abuse.

**Great work! Would you like feedback or support on the next body paragraph, transitions, or your conclusion?  
Or do you want to practice these revision steps yourself now?**

Let me know how you'd like to continue! You’re on track for strong organization and grammar on your rubric.

*Time:* 2025-11-20T03:34:01.842Z

**You:** Any improvement on paragraph 3

*Time:* 2025-11-20T03:37:13.593Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Let's focus on improving your **third body paragraph** (“It is believed that the problem will be more serious due to weak regulation...”) to strengthen organization, clarity, and grammar. Our goal will be to ensure this paragraph:

- Clearly develops your argument (why weak regulations worsen exploitation)
- Flows logically from the previous paragraph and toward your recommendations
- Maintains strong grammar and sentence structure

---

**Your original third paragraph:**
> It is believed that the problem will be more serious due to weak regulation. Unless government enforce stricter regulations, most of the company that operating production chain will continue to exploit migrant workers’ rights.

---

### **Step-by-step revision**

1. **Topic Sentence:**  
   State clearly why the exploitation will get worse (connect to regulation/laws).

2. **Supporting Detail(s):**  
   Explain how weak or missing regulations allow companies to continue abusing migrant workers.

3. **Transition:**  
   Prepare to move into solutions/recommendations (your next paragraph).

---

#### **Guiding prompts:**
- Why is weak regulation a problem?
- How does it let companies continue exploitation?
- What is the potential consequence if nothing changes?

---

### **Suggested structure and hints:**

**Topic sentence idea:**  
Because current laws are weak or not enforced, exploitation of migrant workers will likely become an even more serious problem.

**Supporting detail:**  
Without strong government regulations, companies can easily ignore workers' rights and focus only on profit.

**Consequence/transition:**  
This means exploitation may become even more common unless stronger laws are implemented.

---

### **Now, would you like to try rewriting this paragraph yourself, using the structure and prompts above?**

Or, would you like a full example for inspiration first?

---

#### **If you'd like a model example (not for direct copy, just guidance):**

> The exploitation of migrant workers is likely to become worse if there are no strict regulations to stop it. When governments do not enforce strong laws, many companies are able to ignore workers' rights and focus only on lowering costs. As a result, the abuse of migrant workers may continue or even increase, making government action even more urgent.

***Would you like to try writing your own version now? If so, send it when you’re ready, and I’ll review and encourage you!*** 

If you’d like to go sentence-by-sentence, just tell me—whatever supports your learning best!

*Time:* 2025-11-20T03:37:21.066Z

**You:** It is believed that the problem will be serious due to weak regulation. Unless the government enforces stricter regulations, offer fair pay and fair compensation, the exploitation will worsen. Most of the companies that operate the production chain will continue to ignore migrant workers’ rights and focus on lowering the costs .

*Time:* 2025-11-20T04:03:47.396Z

**Assistant:** Excellent effort! Your revised paragraph is much clearer, better organized, and more closely connected to your thesis and previous arguments. Let’s review and give focused, encouraging feedback:

---

**Strengths:**
- **Topic sentence** directly states that weak regulation is a key contributor to the worsening problem.
- **Supporting details** explain consequences (“offer fair pay and compensation” as a solution, “ignore migrant workers’ rights” as a risk).
- You include reasons for company behavior (“focus on lowering the costs”) that make the argument logical.
- Sentences are more accurate and free of major errors!

**Small suggestions for grammar and clarity:**
- "It is believed that" is often unnecessary; you can be more direct for academic writing.
- Consider combining and streamlining for smoother flow.
- “Offer fair pay and fair compensation” fits more in the solutions paragraph—focus here on the *consequences of not enforcing regulations.*
- “Most of the companies that operate the production chain” can be simplified to “most companies.”

---

### **Here’s your paragraph with suggested minor edits (please review and adjust as you like):**

> The exploitation of migrant workers will become even more serious if regulations remain weak. Unless the government enforces stricter laws, most companies will continue to ignore migrant workers’ rights and focus on lowering costs, which leads to ongoing and increased abuse.

---

**Would you like to adjust your sentences to sound more academic and confident, as above? Or are you satisfied with your current version?**

**You:** I want to revise this paragraph: It is suggested that the government should implement a set of policy to protect migrant workers’ human rights and compensation. Ensuring they have fair pay that only accept selling the products that made in an ethical producing process. The regulation is that companies must guaranteed and certified the products are made from the workers who are safeguarded and fair payed.

*Time:* 2025-11-20T04:06:18.512Z

**Assistant:** Excellent! Let’s work together to **revise your solution/recommendation paragraph** so it is clear, organized, and uses strong grammar.

---

## **Step-by-Step Revision**

**First, let’s diagnose the paragraph:**

**Original Paragraph:**
> It is suggested that the government should implement a set of policy to protect migrant workers’ human rights and compensation. Ensuring they have fair pay that only accept selling the products that made in an ethical producing process. The regulation is that companies must guaranteed and certified the products are made from the workers who are safeguarded and fair payed.

**Strengths:**
- Your main idea (the government needs to act) is clear.
- You mention ethical production and fair pay, which are relevant solutions.

**Areas to Improve:**
- **Grammar and clarity:** Watch for subject-verb agreement and word choice (“a set of policy → a set of policies”).
- **Organization and flow:** Connect your sentences for logical progression.
- **Sentence structure:** Avoid fragments; use complete sentences.

---

## **Guided Questions**

- What specific policy actions should the government take?
- How do these actions protect human rights and ensure fair pay?
- How can companies show products are made ethically?

---

## **Revision Strategy**

**Model Structure:**
1. **Topic sentence:** State your recommendation clearly.
2. **Detail:** Explain fair pay and protection measures.
3. **Detail:** Describe how regulations ensure ethical production.
4. **Concluding sentence:** Summarize the importance of strict policies.

---

### **Sentence Prompts**

**Try revising using these prompts:**

- The government should create strict policies to protect migrant workers’ rights and guarantee fair pay and compensation.
- Regulations should require companies to prove that their products are made under ethical conditions.
- Companies must be certified to show their workers are safe and fairly paid.

---

**Would you like to try rewriting the paragraph with these ideas? You can start with a draft or write one sentence at a time!  
Let me know how you’d like to proceed—or share your revised version and I’ll review it and give feedback.**

---

### **Example (for inspiration, not for direct copying):**

> The government should introduce strict policies that protect the human rights of migrant workers and guarantee fair pay and compensation. These regulations must ensure that companies only sell products made under ethical working conditions. Companies should be required to certify that their products are made by workers who receive fair wages and are safeguarded from abuse.

**Keep up the excellent work! Your organization, grammar, and argument are all getting stronger with every step.**

*Time:* 2025-11-20T04:06:25.625Z

**You:** I add more details for the suggestions,

It is suggested that the government should implement a set of policies to protect migrant workers’ human rights and compensation. Require companies to prove their products are made in ethical conditions .Only allow selling the products certified as “exploitation-free,” and proof of fair wages ,fair compensation and safe conditions. Otherwise, they should face panelties. Also, government should set a minimum wage for migrant workers to force companies to offer a fair wage for workers.

*Time:* 2025-11-20T04:17:06.863Z

**Assistant:** Fantastic work! Your revised solution/recommendation paragraph is much clearer, more detailed, and better organized. Let’s review your improvements and fine-tune for grammar and academic style:

---

**Feedback — Strengths:**  
- **Organization:** You present a clear sequence: policies, proof, certification, penalties, minimum wage.
- **Detail:** Specifies required actions and consequences (certification, fair wages, penalties).
- **Grammar:** Much improved, only a few minor errors!
- **Clarity:** Direct, confident statements—great for academic style.

**Minor suggestions for grammar and clarity:**
- “panelties” — spelling: **penalties**
- “proof of fair wages ,fair compensation and safe conditions” — consider parallel structure and punctuation.
- “a set of policies to protect migrant workers’ human rights and compensation.” — match with later focus on fair pay/wages.
- Use complete sentences (rather than fragments) for strong paragraph unity.

---

### **Here’s your paragraph after minor edits for clarity, grammar, and flow:**

> The government should implement a set of policies to protect migrant workers’ human rights and guarantee fair compensation. Companies must be required to prove that their products are made under ethical conditions. Only products certified as “exploitation-free”—with evidence of fair wages, fair compensation, and safe working conditions—should be allowed for sale. Otherwise, companies should face penalties. In addition, the government should set a minimum wage for migrant workers to force companies to pay fairly.

**Assistant:** Of course! Let’s focus on **your conclusion** and how to make it both **stronger** and **more impactful**—this will help your essay leave a lasting impression and score higher for organization and content on your rubric.

---

## **Your Current Conclusion**

> To sum up, government is the most important role to support the migrant workers and protect their human rights.

---

## **Feedback on Your Conclusion**

### **Strengths**
- You restate the importance of government action.
- The sentence is direct and summarizes your main argument.

### **Areas to Improve**
- **Clarity & Grammar:**  
  - “government is the most important role” → should be “the government has the most important role” or “plays the most important role”
- **Impact:**  
  - A strong conclusion does more than repeat the main point.  
  - It often summarizes your key arguments, highlights urgency or significance, and leaves the reader with a recommendation, prediction, or call to action.
- **Vocabulary:**  
  - Including “protect their human rights” is good; maybe add “by enforcing strict laws and fair pay.”
- **Tone:**  
  - Try to be confident and direct. Academic writing benefits from a clear, assertive final statement.

---

## **Making Your Conclusion More Impactful**

### **Strategies**
- Briefly summarize your key argument(s) (“Migrant workers face exploitation; urgent government action is essential”)
- Clearly state *why* this matters (“for their health, dignity, and social fairness”)
- Offer a call to action or prediction (“If strict policies are not enforced, exploitation will continue”)
- Use topic-specific vocabulary (“human rights,” “fair compensation,” “ethical employment”)

---

### **Prompts/Questions for Revision**
- Why do governments need to take action?  
- What will happen if they don’t?
- What is your final recommendation or hope for the future?

---

### **Suggested Conclusion Example Structures**
1. **Summary + Call to Action**  
   > In conclusion, migrant workers face serious exploitation, and government intervention is essential to protect their human rights and ensure fair treatment. Without strict regulations and enforcement, the abuse of migrant workers will continue. Strong policies are necessary to guarantee ethical employment and fair compensation for all.

2. **Summary + Prediction**  
   > If governments do not take decisive action by creating and enforcing strict laws, the exploitation of migrant workers will become even more serious. Protecting their rights is crucial for a fair and humane society.

3. **Summary + Emphasis on Significance**  
   > Protecting migrant workers from exploitation is not only a matter of law, but of human dignity. Governments must play a leading role in ensuring justice and fairness for those most vulnerable in our workforce.

## **Final, Fully Revised Essay**

Migrant workers are now facing serious exploitation that affects their lives. Governments should enforce stricter laws and regulations to protect their human rights and stop abuse by ensuring fair pay and compensation.

Many factories prefer to employ migrant workers as there is inadequate local labour willing to work in low-paid production jobs, creating a situation where exploitation is common. In developed countries like the United States, most educated local people choose better-paying jobs instead of hard and low-paying factory work. Employers know that migrant workers have limited choices and are powerless, so they often offer low wages and harsh conditions. As a result, exploitation is widespread and serious. Stricter laws are necessary to protect their rights from such abuse.

The exploitation of migrant workers will become even more serious if regulations remain weak. Unless the government enforces stricter laws, most companies will continue to ignore migrant workers’ rights and focus on lowering costs, which leads to ongoing and increased abuse.

The government should implement a set of policies to protect migrant workers’ human rights and guarantee fair compensation. Companies must be required to prove that their products are made under ethical conditions. Only products certified as “exploitation-free”—with evidence of fair wages, fair compensation, and safe working conditions—should be allowed for sale. Otherwise, companies should face penalties.

To sum up, government plays the most important role in supporting migrant workers and protecting their human rights. Governments should enforce strict minimum wages and punish abusers severely. These actions will help end the injustice against migrant workers.
