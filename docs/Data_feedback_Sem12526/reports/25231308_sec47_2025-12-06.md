            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing your essay and the previous feedback. To help you continue improving, here is a suggested revision of your thesis statement that is clear, concise, and previews the two main points:

"While individual actions alone cannot solve climate change, they are important because citizens can influence government policies, and personal lifestyle choices can help shift social norms and market demand."

Please try rewriting your thesis using this model or your own wording, focusing on clarity and previewing both points. Once you share your new thesis here, I’ll provide specific feedback and help you move forward with the next revision steps.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - Clear, relevant stance (partial agreement). The essay presents two main ideas (influence government; personal lifestyle choices) with examples, but development is somewhat general and lacks concrete, specific evidence beyond broad examples.
- Organization: 20/25 - Logical paragraphing (introduction, two body paragraphs, conclusion). Some sentence-level coherence issues and a few weak transitions reduce flow.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Adequate, everyday vocabulary appropriate for the topic but limited variety and few topic-specific terms (e.g., policy instruments, emissions targets, collective action) that would strengthen the essay.
- Grammar: 16/25 - Frequent grammar and usage errors that sometimes affect clarity (e.g., "maybe just listen a little", "so is not always working well", missing articles, subject-verb and tense issues).
- **Original Essay Total: 75/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - Content is unchanged but slightly weakened by duplication of the thesis lines at the start; no additional evidence or development added.
- Organization: 18/25 - Duplicate sentences in the opening paragraph disrupt the introduction’s clarity and organization; body paragraphs remain the same, so overall structure is similar but less tidy.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary remains at the same level as the original; no notable enhancement.
- Grammar: 16/25 - Grammar errors persist; duplication suggests editing oversight. Errors that existed in the original remain uncorrected.
- **Revised Essay Total: 72/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -3 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None substantive — the revised draft did not implement the targeted thesis revision suggested by the AI coach.
  - Structure of body paragraphs was retained, preserving the basic argumentative framework.
  - The essay consistently identifies two relevant roles for individuals (influencing policy and changing personal behavior).
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Revision of the thesis statement was not completed (repetition in the revised draft shows the original thesis was not reworked).
  - Topic sentences and body paragraphs were not meaningfully revised for clarity, evidence, or sentence-level grammar.
  - Grammar, word choice precision, and transition use were not addressed.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 3** (assistant welcome/guidance; student pasted essay; assistant provided detailed feedback on thesis and asked the student to rewrite it).
- **Conversation Quality:** Sparse. The assistant provided targeted guidance about revising the thesis and a clear checklist. The student pasted the draft but did not submit a revised thesis or continue the iterative exchange.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 - The chat shows an initial coaching prompt and the student posting the essay, followed by the assistant’s detailed guidance. There was no extended back-and-forth, no follow-up revisions from the student in the chat history, and overall depth is minimal.
  - Evidence: Assistant asked, "Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?" and later gave a checklist and invited the student to rewrite the thesis. The student did not provide the requested revision in chat.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 - The student did not demonstrate evaluation or selective acceptance/rejection of AI suggestions in the chat. There is no evidence of the student questioning or justifying choices.
  - Evidence: After receiving instructions and a checklist, the student did not respond with a revised thesis or comments.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 - No iterative revisions are visible in the chat; the revised essay file shows duplication rather than a purposeful revision. The refining cycle was not completed.
  - Evidence: Assistant waited for a rewritten thesis ("I’ll wait until you’re happy with the thesis before we move to Step 2"), but the chat contains no student revision.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 4/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student identifies two reasonable and relevant roles for individuals in combating climate change: influencing government/policy and adopting personal green habits. (Evidence: both drafts explicitly state these two focal points.)
- The student provides basic examples (protesting, voting, recycling, buying from green companies) that show an understanding of mechanisms linking individual action to broader change.
- The student engaged with the AI initially by pasting the full draft so the assistant could analyze it.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Follow through on AI guidance: revise the thesis as requested and continue the iterative process. (Recommendation: produce a concise two-point thesis that previews the two body arguments.)
- Edit for grammar and clarity: fix sentence-level issues, eliminate repetitions, and improve transitions between ideas.
- Strengthen evidence and specificity: include concrete examples, data, or specific policy types to support claims (e.g., cite a policy change resulting from public pressure).
- Engage critically with AI suggestions: indicate acceptance/rejection and explain reasoning; request alternative phrasings or examples.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Needs Improvement - The student provided the draft but did not state revision goals in chat beyond pasting the text. The assistant did give a clear task, but the student did not respond with the requested revisions.
- Strategic Planning: Needs Improvement - No plan or revision steps were reported by the student in chat (no targeted objectives, no timeline, no acceptance of AI suggestions).
- Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement - No evidence the student evaluated AI feedback or made selective choices; the revised essay shows no visible critical engagement.
- Independent Editing: Needs Improvement - The revised essay shows only duplication and no substantive editing; grammar and clarity remain unaddressed.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise the thesis immediately following the assistant’s checklist: state a concise stance (e.g., "I partly agree..."), and preview the two main points (policy influence; personal behavior shaping norms/markets). Submit that revised thesis in chat for feedback before proceeding.
2. Adopt an iterative revision workflow in the chat: after each AI suggestion, respond with acceptance/rejection and a rationale, then post a concrete revision. Aim for multiple short cycles (revise thesis → revise paragraph 1 → revise paragraph 2).
3. Focus one revision pass on sentence-level editing: remove redundancies, correct grammar (articles, verb forms), and improve transitions. Then a second pass on content: add one concrete, specific example or statistic to support each main point.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student did not complete the requested task of revising the thesis despite the assistant’s clear prompt and checklist. The "revised" essay provided to the assessor contains duplicated thesis sentences and no substantive edits to topic sentences or body paragraphs. Mark this submission as incomplete for the module’s revision requirement and request the student to return a focused revision: a new thesis, one revised topic sentence, and one revised body paragraph (all provided in the chat as discrete steps) so that the iterative AI-assisted process can be properly evaluated.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

**Assistant:** Great — let’s start with Step 1: the thesis statement.

Which of these sentences is your current thesis? (I see this one in your drafts:)
"I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Feedback on clarity, strength, and focus
- Clarity: The idea is understandable, but the sentence is long and a little repetitive. “I partly agree” + “I believe” + “I also think” adds hedging and weakens the tone.
- Strength: You state a partial position, which is fine for this question, but the thesis should define the balance more clearly (how and why individuals matter). Right now it tells the reader what you think but doesn’t preview the main points cleanly.
- Focus: The thesis mentions two broad points (influence on government; personal lifestyle choices). That’s a good structure — make those two points explicit and concise so the reader knows the essay’s organization.

How to improve (what to include)
- Answer the question directly (to what extent do you agree?): e.g., clearly say “partly agree” or “agree to a large extent,” then explain why briefly.
- Preview the essay’s two main reasons: (1) individuals can influence governments/policy, and (2) personal lifestyle changes, though smaller in impact, can influence markets/social norms.
- Use confident, concise language; remove phrases like “I believe” or “in my opinion.”

Checklist for your revision
- Do I state my stance clearly?
- Do I preview two main points (influence on government; role of personal choices)?
- Is the language confident and concise?

Would you like to try rewriting that thesis now using the checklist? Type your revised thesis and I’ll give focused feedback. I’ll wait until you’re happy with the thesis before we move to Step 2.
