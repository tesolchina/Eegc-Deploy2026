# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The essay expresses a clear viewpoint (that governments should protect migrants and that migrants contribute to society) and lists specific policy areas (working hours, wages, healthcare, education). However, ideas are not tied to the assigned topic (climate change) and some key claims are imprecise (e.g., "As migrants are already citizens of a country..." is factually problematic).
- Organization: 17/25 - The essay has identifiable paragraphs and a conclusion, but there is repetition (conclusion repeats prior points) and weak transitions between some ideas; topic sentences are not consistently explicit.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Generally appropriate vocabulary with some precise policy terms (healthcare insurance, wages), but occasional awkward or inaccurate phrasing reduces impact.
- Grammar: 18/25 - Sentence structures are mostly correct and readable, but there are factual/wording errors and some sentences could be more concise or precise.
- **Original Essay Total: 71/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The "revised" essay is identical to the original; no substantive changes were made to address the key issues (topic mismatch, thesis clarity, evidence).
- Organization: 17/25 - No improvements to paragraph structure or transitions are present in the revised text.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - No changes; vocabulary strengths/limitations remain the same.
- Grammar: 18/25 - No changes; grammar performance unchanged.
- **Revised Essay Total: 71/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None — the revised essay provided is identical to the original, so no measurable improvements were implemented.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The most critical missed opportunity is to make the essay answer the assigned prompt about "the individual's role in climate change" — the current essay focuses on migrant rights and therefore does not meet the assignment requirements.
  - Strengthening the thesis so it directly answers the assignment, previewing the essay structure, and correcting the factual inaccuracy in the opening sentence would substantially improve clarity and score.
  - Adding concrete evidence (data, examples, citations) to support claims and reworking paragraph topic sentences and internal coherence would increase persuasiveness and organization.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 7 messages** (assistant + user turns combined)
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided thorough, scaffolded guidance (including a 3-step revision plan). The student engaged minimally: asked how to submit, asked whether submission can be done here, and replied "A" to the assistant's question about changing the essay to a climate-change focus. The student did not perform the requested revisions (thesis, topic sentence, paragraph) nor did they supply drafts of revised sentences for feedback.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 - The chat shows a few substantive assistant messages and a few brief student replies. The interaction is assistant-led and sparse from the student's side; student engagement was limited (simple questions and a single selection "A") and did not progress through the revision steps.
  - Evidence: assistant gave a detailed multi-step plan and diagnostic; student replies include "我怎么提交给老师", "不能在这里直接提交吗？", and a single-letter reply "A".
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 - The student did not demonstrate critical evaluation of AI suggestions. There is no evidence the student accepted, rejected, or provided reasons for decisions about the assistant’s recommendations.
  - Evidence: The assistant proposed options and asked the student to choose priorities; the student selected A but did not comment on the proposed revision steps or rationales.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 - No iterative revisions were made. The chat contains planning and guidance but no cycles of revision and feedback on drafted changes.
  - Evidence: The "revised" essay file is identical to the original; the chat ends before Step 1 (thesis rewrite) is executed.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 4/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student has a clear stance in the essay topic they wrote (pro-migrant-protection) and proposes concrete policy areas (working hours, wages, healthcare, children's education) — evidence: essay paragraphs listing these measures.
- The assistant provided a clear, pedagogically sound revision plan (three-step process: revise thesis, revise a topic sentence, revise a body paragraph) and explicit submission guidance; this demonstrates good AI scaffolding for the student to follow.
- The student showed minimal initial engagement by indicating a desire to change the essay topic to the climate-change prompt (reply "A"), which indicates willingness to retarget the assignment.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Complete the three required revision tasks (revised thesis statement, one revised topic sentence, and one revised body paragraph). None were submitted; the "revised" essay is unchanged.
- Align the essay to the assigned prompt (individual role in climate change). The current content focuses on migrants and therefore does not address the assignment.
- Engage more actively with the AI: draft revisions, evaluate AI suggestions, iterate through feedback cycles, and ask clarifying questions. Provide explicit accept/reject reasons when choosing among AI suggestions.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student did not supply the course prompt or confirm assignment constraints in chat; the assistant had to infer a mismatch and point it out. Evidence: assistant repeatedly notes the essay does not answer the climate-change prompt.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The assistant provided a clear plan, but the student did not follow through to execute it.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - No evidence the student critically assessed the AI’s suggestions or justified choices.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The student did not perform the requested revisions; the revised essay is unchanged.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Make the revision tasks explicit and complete them: write and paste a new thesis that answers the climate-change prompt; then write a revised topic sentence for one body paragraph and paste the fully revised paragraph for feedback. Do this in the chat so the assistant can iterate on your drafts.
2. Ensure the essay is on-topic: if the assignment is about individual action on climate change, reframe arguments (e.g., individual behavior change, civic engagement, consumer choices) and use the assistant’s three-step process to produce a new thesis and supporting paragraph.
3. Engage in iterative, critical collaboration: when the AI offers suggestions, respond with acceptance, rejection, or modification plus brief reasoning; request multiple alternatives and test them against your voice and assignment requirements.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student’s "revised" submission is identical to the original; the required revision steps were not completed. Recommend requiring resubmission that includes:
  - a new thesis addressing the assigned climate-change prompt,
  - one revised topic sentence, and
  - one fully revised body paragraph,
  along with a short reflection (50–100 words) describing how AI suggestions were used and which were accepted or rejected.
- The assistant correctly identified a topic mismatch; instructor should confirm whether the student intended to change topics or misunderstood the assignment.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
As migrants are already citizens of a country, governments are obligated to protect their rights.
Many migrants experience linguistic discrimination and racial abuse, which undermines their self-esteem and violates their social rights. When they encounter unfair treatment because of their immigrant identity, they may take to the streets in protests and marches—actions that hinder social development and long-term sustainability.
On the other hand, if a government fails to address this issue, its country will be labeled as "unfriendly to diversity". A thriving nation is built on the principles of diversity and equitable treatment for all. Without these, it will lose a large pool of talented individuals. Poor cultural exchange will also make the country unwelcome in global cooperation, leading to economic losses. Migrants are an integral part of a nation’s foundation: they not only provide labor but also foster a more open mindset that aligns with globalization.
In conclusion, there is an urgent need to enact laws to protect migrants, safeguarding their equal living standards and mental well-being. Pursuing equity and fairness should always be a top priority for governments. Migrants deserve the same rights as native-born citizens, as they contribute significantly to society and the nation as a whole.
Migrant protection should cover multiple aspects: their working hours should be regulated, their salaries and wages should match those of native employees in the same positions, and more attention should be paid to their healthcare insurance and their children’s education. While governments still have a long way to go, gradual efforts to build an inclusive, diversity-friendly atmosphere can reverse this situation. This is not an inevitable problem, but a manageable challenge facing the global community.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

**You:** 我怎么提交给老师

*Time:* 2025-11-30T05:07:00.756Z

**Assistant:** 很高兴帮你！先回答你问的“我怎么提交给老师”——我会同时帮你决定提交内容（需要先把文章修好、确认符合题目）和写好提交邮件/格式。先我们按流程走几步：先谈目标并做诊断，然后你选优先改哪几项，最后我会帮你逐步改（从论文陈述开始）。你先回答几个问题，我们再继续：

1) 你现在最想达成的目标是什么？（可选多个）
- 让文章内容切题（与题目“个人在气候变化中的作用”相符）
- 增强论点/论证力度
- 改进结构与段落衔接
- 改写论文陈述（thesis）
- 语法与表达更准确、正式
告诉我你最看重哪两项。

2) 你是要提交“现在这稿（需要改）”还是想先完全修改好再提交？老师有没有指定提交方式（邮箱、学校系统如Canvas/Moodle，或纸质）或文件格式（docx/pdf）？

下面是我对你当前文章的简短诊断（按常用评分维度：Thesis & Argument, Organization, Evidence & Development, Language Use）——先看整体优点与需要改进的地方：

优点（Strengths）
- 观点明确：你在文中清楚表达了“政府应保护移民权利，移民对国家有贡献”的立场。
- 有具体政策建议（工作时间、工资、医保、教育），显示你在思考可行的措施。
- 结尾呼吁和语气恰当，态度坚定。

需要改进的地方（Areas for improvement）
- 切题严重问题：你给的作文题是关于“个人在气候变化中作用与政府/大公司相比是否微不足道”，但文章内容完全讨论“移民权利保护”。这是最关键的问题——如果不把文章改为回答气候变化题，分数会很低。
- 论文陈述（thesis）：没有清晰直接的 thesis 来回答题目（目前文章开头也与事实不符，如“As migrants are already citizens...”）。需要一个直接、具体、预览主点的 thesis。
- 组织与段落：段落之间和段内有重复（比如结论段和建议段内容重复），主题句有时不明确，逻辑连贯性弱。
- 证据与发展：论点多为一般化陈述，缺乏事实、数据或具体例子来支持（若是考学术写作，需用例子或推理增强说服力）。
- 语言与用词：有事实性错误（“migrants are already citizens”通常不成立），个别句子表达不够准确或自然，标点和衔接词可改进。

请你现在选择你想在本次修订中优先处理的两个问题（必须从上面列出的弱点里选），比如：
- 把文章改成切题（把论题改为气候变化并写新的 thesis）
- 改写论文陈述并保持现有主题（如果你确实要写移民那就要改题目/老师同意）
- 改进一段的主题句与段落内部支持
- 语法与措辞改进

确认你选择的两个优先项后，我们就开始 Step 1：改写 thesis（如果你选了 thesis 或切题，我会先引导你写一条新的、能回答题目的 thesis）。如果你只是想知道“怎么提交给老师”，下面是直接可用的提交指南（中文样板）：

快速提交指南（如果你只需要提交方式）
- 常用格式：pdf（最安全，不会走样）或 .docx（若老师要求可编辑文件）。
- 文件命名建议：Course_LastName_FirstName_AssignmentName_Date.pdf 例如：ENG101_Wang_Xiaoming_Essay1_20251130.pdf
- 附上一封简短礼貌的邮件（若通过邮箱提交）。样板如下，你可以直接复制改名字：

  邮件主题：Submission: [课程名] [作业名] — 姓名
  邮件正文：
  教授/老师您好，
  附上我本次的作业《[作业名]》。文件为PDF格式，字数约[字数]字。如有需要我可以提供Word版本或进行进一步修改。感谢您审阅！
  此致
  敬礼
  姓名
  学号（如有）
  日期

- 如果通过学校系统（Canvas/Moodle/Blackboard）：按老师要求上传，上传后记得确认“提交成功”或截图证明。
- 若老师要求查重（Turnitin）：先自检，保存一版副本，再提交正式版。
- 如需同时提交原稿与修改说明（比如老师要求反思陈述），可以附上一个简短的“修改说明/自我评估”1段（50–100字）说明你改了哪些地方、如何改进。

下一步怎么做？
- 如果你只是想知道如何提交：告诉我老师用什么方式（邮箱/系统），我可以把上面的样板帮你改成更正式的版本并检查文件名，然后你就可以直接复制粘贴发送。
- 如果你想按写作流程修订文章（强烈建议，因为当前稿子不切题）：请确认你要把文章改为回答原题（气候变化）还是保留移民主题（并和老师确认题目是否允许）。并告诉我你优先要改的两项（我会按照三步流程从改 thesis 开始）。

你想先做哪样？我们马上开始下一步。

*Time:* 2025-11-30T05:07:17.790Z

**You:** 不能在这里直接提交吗？

*Time:* 2025-11-30T05:11:44.255Z

**Assistant:** 很好——我们按你一开始要求的流程来。先确认目标与诊断，然后你选优先要改的两项；确认后我才开始 Step 1（改 thesis）。下面是需要你回复的几个简短问题，并附上我对当前稿的简短诊断（已看过你给的原稿与“改过”的版本，两者内容相同）。

1) 你现在最想达成的两个目标是什么？（请从下面选最多两个）
- 把文章改成切题（把论题改为“个人在气候变化中的作用”并写新的 thesis）
- 改写论文陈述（thesis）
- 改进一段的主题句与段落内部支持（选择具体段落）
- 改进整体结构与段落衔接
- 增强论证力与证据（加入数据/例子/推理）
- 语法与措辞改进（正式、准确的表达）

请直接回复你要的两个选项（例如：“切题 + 改写 thesis”）。

2) 关于题目方向：你原稿讨论的是移民权利，但老师布置的题目是关于气候变化——你要我
- A) 把文章整体改成回答气候变化题（强烈建议这样做）
- B) 保留移民主题（如果你确定老师允许或你要另选题目，请说明）

请在回复中选择 A 或 B。

简短诊断（根据常用评分维度）
- 优点
  - 立场明确、语气坚定，提出了具体政策建议（工作时间、工资、医保、教育）。
  - 结尾呼吁明确，表达出行动必要性。
- 需要改进（必须关注）
  - 切题性：当前稿与给定题目不一致（极其重要，若不改题目会严重扣分）。
  - 论文陈述：没有清晰、直接回答题目或预览文章结构的 thesis。
  - 组织与段落：段落主题句/段内支持和结尾处有重复，衔接可加强。
  - 证据与发展：论点多为笼统陈述，缺乏具体例子或数据支持。
  - 语言问题：有事实不准（如“As migrants are already citizens...”），需更准确表述与更正式风格。

现在请你：
- 选出第1问里的两个优先目标（最多两个）。
- 选 A 或 B（是否把文章改为气候变化题）。
- 告诉我你准备好在这里开始改 thesis 吗（如果选了“改写 thesis”或“切题”，我们就从 Step 1 开始；如果你选的是别的两项，也仍可先改 thesis 作为起点）。

一旦你确认，我会：
- 要你粘出/写出当前的 thesis（如果你要切题但没有草稿，我会引导你写一条新的）。
- 给出简短反馈并鼓励你尝试改写，然后继续到 Step 2 与 Step 3（只改 thesis + 1 段的主题句 + 该段内容）。

准备好了就回我两个选择 + A/B。我们马上开始。

*Time:* 2025-11-30T05:11:56.616Z

**You:** A

*Time:* 2025-11-30T05:15:28.917Z

**Assistant:** 很好，你已经选了 A（把文章改成回答气候变化题），这是我强烈建议的方向。现在我们还需要你从诊断中再选两个优先目标（最多两个），然后我就开始按三步流程带你修订。

我建议的优先组合（你可以直接选其中一组，也可以自己选）：
- 选项1（推荐）：把文章改成切题 + 改写论文陈述（thesis）——先把整体方向改对，再写一条清晰有力的 thesis 作为整篇的骨架。
- 选项2：把文章改成切题 + 增强论证力与证据——如果你想侧重用事实/例子支撑观点。
- 选项3：把文章改成切题 + 改进一段的主题句与段内支持——如果你更想在单段深挖理路与表达。

请直接回复你要的两项（例如：“切题 + 改写论文陈述”）。确认后我们就开始 Step 1。

另外请回答两个简短问题以便我能马上开始引导你写新的 thesis：
1) 你在题目上倾向于何种立场？（请选择一个并简短说明）
   - 强烈同意：个人行动确实重要（举例：改变消费、减少交通排放、公众压力促使政策改变）。
   - 部分同意/中立：个人行动有价值但效果有限，需与政府/企业措施结合。
   - 不同意：个人行动微不足道，主要依赖政府和大公司政策与技术。

2) 你想先自己尝试写一条新的 thesis，还是要我先给你一到两个句型/范例供你参考？（请选择“自己写”或“给我句型”）

确认这两项后，请把你写的 thesis（如果你选择“自己写”并已写好）粘上来；如果没有，我会给出提示句型，鼓励你尝试一次。我们只从 thesis 开始，改好后才继续到段落主题句与段落内容。准备好了就回复：两项优先目标 + 立场选择 + 想法（自己写 / 给我句型）。
