# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - The essay states a clear position that automation will ultimately enhance employment prospects and mentions plausible reasons (education, efficiency, innovation). Development is basic and sometimes repetitive; moral appeals replace concrete explanation or examples (e.g., "All productions should be carried out to improve people's quality of life").
- Organization: 18/25 - The essay has an identifiable introduction, body, and conclusion, but paragraphs often mix multiple points (education, efficiency, morality) and lack focused development and smooth transitions.
- Vocabulary: 17/25 - Vocabulary is adequate but somewhat generic and occasionally awkward (e.g., "professional knowledge or mental input"); limited use of topic-specific terms or precise phrasing.
- Grammar: 18/25 - Generally readable with understandable sentence structures, but there are awkward constructions and register issues (informal rhetorical questions, absolutes) and some minor errors.
- **Original Essay Total: 71/100**

Evidence (Original):
- Thesis: "From my point of view, my answer to this question is positive: this technological shift will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term."
- Mixed paragraph: "However, society is developing rapidly, which means the educational level is improving, so humans will no longer rely on manual labor to make a living. ... What's more, if the technological shift ultimately undermines global employment prospects, leading some people to become homeless ... can humanity achieve real progress? No, I don't think so."

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The revised thesis more directly previews reasons: "will ultimately enhance global employment prospects by creating new industries, raising workforce productivity, and increasing demand for skilled wokers." This adds argumentative structure. However, the essay still lacks specific evidence, examples, or data to support claims.
- Organization: 20/25 - The thesis now signals the main lines of argument, and the first body topic sentence was revised to align better with the thesis. Paragraph-level coherence still needs work: some paragraphs continue to conflate multiple ideas and include rhetorical questions that weaken academic tone.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Word choice improves in places ("specialized skills" replaces earlier phrasing), but spelling and typographical errors remain (e.g., "wokers", "orr") and some phrasing is still imprecise.
- Grammar: 17/25 - The revised draft contains several slips (typos: "wokers", "orr") and some awkward constructions remain. Tone still leans toward informal rhetoric in places.
- **Revised Essay Total: 75/100**

Evidence (Revised):
- Revised thesis: "From my perspective, this technological transformation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects by creating new industries, raising workforce productivity, and increasing demand for skilled wokers."
- Revised topic sentence: "Indeed, automation is transforming industries by replacing many jobs that do not require specialized skills orr cognitive input."
- Body paragraph (minor revision): "However, society is developing rapidly, which means the educational level is improving, so humans will shift from manual labor to make a living. Besides, nothing matters more than the improved efficiency brought by automation—it not only saves production costs for enterprises but also spares time for people to develop more innovative products ..."

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- Overall Improvement: +4 points
- Key Improvements Made:
  - Thesis clarity and preview: The revised thesis is more direct and previews three supporting points (new industries, productivity, demand for skilled workers), giving the essay a clearer argumentative roadmap.
  - Topic-sentence revision: The first body topic sentence was rephrased to "specialized skills" (an improvement in focus compared with "professional knowledge or mental input").
  - Slight tightening of phrasing in places and clearer emphasis on the long-term perspective.
- Missed Opportunities:
  - Proofreading: Typos remain (e.g., "wokers", "orr") which undermine credibility—these should be fixed.
  - Paragraph coherence and evidence: Body paragraphs still mix points and lack concrete examples, data, or citations to support claims about job creation or educational trends.
  - Tone and academic register: Use of rhetorical questions ("can humanity achieve real progress?") and absolute statements weakens academic tone; more measured language and removal of rhetorical questions would improve persuasiveness.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- Total Exchanges: 9 (assistant and student turns across the revision task)
- Conversation Quality: Productive, assistant-led workflow with clear scaffolding (diagnosis, recommended steps, targeted questions). The student provided specific text to revise and asked for paragraph revision and general writing advice. The interaction shows focused guidance, but relatively few iterative cycles of revision and limited explicit critical evaluation by the student of AI suggestions.

Specific chat evidence:
- Assistant set a clear process: "Step 1: Revise your thesis statement. Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence. Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph..."
- Student supplied text snippets and asked targeted requests (thesis revision, topic sentence revision, paragraph revision), e.g. "Please help me revise thesis statement" and "Please help me revise these topic sentences".
- The student later asked for general writing suggestions ("Can u give me some suggestions to improve my writing skill?") but did not explicitly accept or reject particular AI suggestions in the chat.

#### Interaction Scores:
- In-Depth Conversation: 3/5 - The chat shows a focused, moderate-length exchange (9 turns) with clear, relevant questions and productive scaffolding. It is not an extensive multi-step revision cycle (15+ turns), so it fits a developing level of depth.
  - Evidence: Assistant offered an in-depth workflow and diagnostics, and the student supplied targeted text for revision, but there were only a few back-and-forth iterations.
- Critical Review of AI Suggestions: 2/5 - The student accepted help and supplied text, but there is little evidence of thorough critique or independent evaluation of AI suggestions in the chat history.
  - Evidence: The student asked for revisions and accepted guidance but did not question or justify accepting/rejecting specific AI edits or propose alternative solutions in the conversation.
- Refining Process: 3/5 - There is some iteration (thesis, topic sentences, paragraph targeted), but the process was not carried through multiple meaningful revision cycles for a single paragraph; the student did not iterate repeatedly on the same paragraph in the chat.
  - Evidence: Assistant prompted priorities and next steps multiple times; the student provided paragraph to revise, but the final revised essay shows only modest paragraph-level changes.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 8/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear stance and argumentative intent: The student maintains a consistent position that automation can enhance long-term employment prospects.
  - Evidence: Thesis in revised essay previews three reasons to support the stance.
- Effective use of AI scaffolding: The student followed the assistant's structured workflow and provided the exact sentences/paragraphs for focused revision.
  - Evidence: Student pasted thesis, candidate topic sentences, and a body paragraph for targeted help.
- Willingness to learn: The student asked for general writing improvement strategies, indicating openness to broader skill development.
  - Evidence: "Can u give me some suggestions to improve my writing skill?"

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Proofreading and accuracy: Fix typographical errors and small misspellings (e.g., "wokers", "orr") to avoid undermining credibility.
  - Recommendation: Run a spell-check, read aloud, and keep an error log for recurring mistakes.
- Paragraph focus and development: Ensure each paragraph has one clear claim, supporting evidence (examples, statistics, citations), explanation, and a link back to the thesis.
  - Recommendation: Use the claim → evidence → explanation → link structure; add concrete examples (e.g., industries where automation created jobs) or brief citation of trends.
- More active critical engagement with AI: Evaluate AI suggestions explicitly (accept/reject and explain why), and perform multiple revision cycles on the same paragraph to deepen improvement.
  - Recommendation: In chat, annotate suggested edits (e.g., "I accept this change because..., but prefer the alternative wording...") and request further refinement.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- Context Provision: Good - The student provided the full essay and target passages, enabling focused feedback.
  - Evidence: Supply of original and revised paragraphs and explicit asks for thesis/topic/paragraph revision.
- Strategic Planning: Good - The student engaged with an assistant-provided revision plan and attempted targeted revisions.
  - Evidence: Followed assistant's Step 1–3 approach and requested targeted help.
- Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement - The student did not show strong independent critique of AI suggestions in this chat.
  - Evidence: Limited comments accepting or testing alternatives; no explicit rejections or comparative choices recorded.
- Independent Editing: Needs Improvement/Developing - The student made some edits but left persistent issues and did not iterate extensively.
  - Evidence: Revised draft shows improved thesis and topic sentence but remaining typos and paragraph coherence issues.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Proofread and correct surface errors before finalizing revisions: address spelling ("workers"), repeated-letter typos ("orr"), and punctuation; use tools and a quick read-aloud pass.
2. Strengthen paragraph development with specific evidence: for each supporting point in the thesis (new industries, productivity, demand for skilled workers), add one concrete example or a brief reference to a credible trend or statistic.
3. Engage more critically with AI: explicitly accept/reject suggestions in chat and request alternative phrasings or further justification; perform at least 2–3 revision cycles focused on one paragraph to show deeper refinement.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student completed the three requested revision tasks (thesis, one topic sentence, and one paragraph) but changes to the paragraph were modest. Encourage the student to apply the assistant’s structural suggestions more thoroughly—especially replacing rhetorical questions with reasoned analysis and including specific evidence.
- Recommend a quick peer review or instructor check focused on factual support and proofreading before considering the essay final.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
With the rapid development, automation is potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency due to transformed industries. How this technological shift will change global employment prospects in the long term is a crucial issue that deserves attention.

From my point of view, my answer to this question is positive: this technological shift will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.

Indeed, automation is transforming industries—it replaces many jobs that do not require professional knowledge or mental input. Currently, there are numerous such jobs in society, so this technological shift will undermine global employment prospects in the short term. This may be the reason why some people believe that the technological shift will undermine global employment prospects.

However, society is developing rapidly, which means the educational level is improving, so humans will no longer rely on manual labor to make a living. Besides, nothing matters more than the improved efficiency brought by automation—it not only saves production costs for enterprises but also spares time for people to develop more innovative products or explore new areas to bring convenience to the whole world. What's more, if the technological shift ultimately undermines global employment prospects, leading some people to become homeless and lack sufficient money to live, can humanity achieve real progress? No, I don't think so. All productions should be carried out to improve people's quality of life.

All in all, although automation may undermine global employment prospects in the short term, it will absolutely enhance global employment in the long term as long as people use it in proper ways.

Revised:
With the rapid development of automation, industries are being transformed—boosting efficiency while potentially reducing jobs. How this technological shift will reshape global employment prospects in the long term is a crucial issue worthy of attention.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

**You:** "With the rapid development, automation is potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency due to transformed industries. How this technological shift will change global employment prospects in the long term is a crucial issue that deserves attention.From my point of view, my answer to this question is positive: this technological shift will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term."Please help me revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-24T13:40:27.121Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I can help with that. First, two quick questions so we set clear targets.

1) What is your priority here? (Choose any): clarity, argument strength (making a stronger claim), previewing the essay’s main points, concision/academic tone, or avoiding hedging.  
2) Do you want me to focus only on the thesis now, or also later on topic sentences and one paragraph?

Quick diagnostic (based on your draft)
- Thesis & Argument: The current thesis states your position but is wordy, repetitive ("from my point of view," "my answer ... is positive," repeated "in the long term") and lacks a clear preview of the main reasons you'll use to support it. It also hedges unnecessarily.
- Organization: Overall structure is okay (introduction, body, conclusion), but the thesis doesn’t clearly signal the paragraph-level argument structure.
- Evidence & Development: You mention points (education, efficiency, innovation) but they need clearer linking to the thesis.
- Language Use: Some redundancy and informal phrasing; stronger, more concise wording would help.

Recommended focus
I suggest we focus on making the thesis more direct, confident, and previewing 2–3 main points (e.g., productivity/efficiency, new industries/jobs, and workforce upskilling/education). Is that the target you want? Reply “Yes — focus on thesis” and I’ll move to Step 1 and propose revised thesis options (and, if you want, insert your chosen thesis into the full essay).

*Time:* 2025-11-24T13:40:49.255Z

**You:** "Indeed, automation is transforming industries—it replaces many jobs that do not require professional knowledge or mental input.""However, society is developing rapidly, which means the educational level is improving, so humans will no longer rely on manual labor to make a living."Please help me revise these topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-24T13:47:31.705Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for the clear prompt and the two candidate topic sentences. Before I revise anything, a quick check so we follow the agreed workflow.

1) Which priority should I focus on for this session? (Pick one or two)
- clarity
- connection to the thesis / argument strength
- concision / academic tone
- avoiding hedging

2) Do you want to:
- revise the thesis first, then a topic sentence and that paragraph, or
- skip straight to revising one topic sentence and its paragraph?

Now a brief diagnostic for the two sentences you quoted (so you can choose which to work on):

A. "Indeed, automation is transforming industries—it replaces many jobs that do not require professional knowledge or mental input."
- Strengths: Direct, acknowledges automation’s disruptive effect.
- Problems: Phrase “professional knowledge or mental input” is awkward and vague; it doesn’t connect clearly to your revised thesis points (new industries, productivity, demand for skilled workers); it’s negative-focused without signaling the paragraph’s purpose (e.g., short-term displacement).

B. "However, society is developing rapidly, which means the educational level is improving, so humans will no longer rely on manual labor to make a living."
- Strengths: Attempts to show how education can mitigate job loss.
- Problems: Wordy and absolute (“no longer rely” is too strong); “educational level is improving” is vague; it needs a clearer link to your thesis (workforce upskilling) and to what evidence or examples you’ll use in the paragraph.

Which one do you want to work on (A or B)? Also tell me your priority from question 1 and whether you want to revise the thesis first or not. If you’d like, try rewriting the chosen topic sentence now (one short attempt), and I’ll give focused feedback and hints before proposing a model. Would you like to try one now?

What's more, if the technological shift ultimately undermines global employment prospects, leading some people to become homeless and lack sufficient money to live, can humanity achieve real progress? No, I don't think so. All productions should be carried out to improve people's quality of life."Revise this body paragraph

*Time:* 2025-11-24T13:54:30.380Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a good paragraph to work on. Before I revise, two quick questions so we set clear targets (we'll follow the agreed workflow):

1) Which priority should I focus on for this paragraph? Pick one or two:
- clarity
- connection to the thesis / argument strength
- concision / academic tone
- avoiding hedging

2) Do you want me to:
- revise the thesis first, then this topic sentence and paragraph, or
- skip the thesis and revise this topic sentence and paragraph only?

Brief diagnostic of the paragraph (short and focused)
- Topic & focus: The paragraph mixes several ideas (education, efficiency, moral argument) so it lacks a clear, single focus tied to your thesis (which lists new industries, productivity, and demand for skilled workers).
- Topic sentence: Weak and absolute (“no longer rely”) and vague (“educational level is improving”).
- Coherence: Transitions jump from education to efficiency to a rhetorical moral question — the paragraph needs a clearer logical progression (claim → evidence/example → explanation → link to thesis).
- Language: Wordy and informal in places (e.g., “nothing matters more than,” “What's more,” “No, I don't think so.”). Avoid rhetorical questions that weaken academic tone.

Next step
Which option do you prefer from question 2? If you want to proceed with this paragraph now, would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence in one short sentence (I’ll give focused feedback), or would you like me to propose a model topic sentence and a revised paragraph for you to edit? Would you like to focus on clarity, connection, concision, or avoiding hedging?

*Time:* 2025-11-24T13:55:01.143Z

**You:** Can u give me some suggestions to improve my writing skill?

*Time:* 2025-11-24T13:56:09.261Z

**Assistant:** Great question — I can help with that. First, a short plan: I’ll give practical, focused suggestions you can use every day, then we’ll return to the negotiated revision workflow (you choose targets and we revise the thesis and one paragraph). Sound good?

Practical suggestions to improve your academic writing (short, actionable)
- Set a small daily habit
  - Write 10–15 minutes every day on a short prompt or a paragraph from your essay. Regular practice builds fluency.
- Read actively and imitate
  - Read 1–2 high-quality model essays or opinion pieces weekly. Notice thesis structure, topic sentences, and how paragraphs develop one idea. Try imitating one sentence structure in your own writing.
- Focus on structure before sentences
  - Use a reverse outline: after you draft, list each paragraph’s main idea in one line. This shows gaps, repetition, and weak links to your thesis.
- Practice precise thesis-writing
  - Make the thesis one clear sentence: answer the question, take a position, and preview 2–3 main reasons. Avoid phrases like “I think” or “from my point of view.”
- Build strong topic sentences
  - Each paragraph should open with one sentence that connects to the thesis and signals the paragraph’s focus (cause, effect, example, rebuttal).
- Develop paragraphs logically
  - Follow claim → evidence/example → explanation (why the evidence matters) → link back to the thesis. Keep one main idea per paragraph.
- Tighten language and tone
  - Cut filler words (really, very, actually). Replace vague nouns (things, society) with specific terms (manufacturing, retail, service sector).
- Avoid absolutes and rhetorical questions in academic essays
  - Don’t use “never,” “always,” “no one,” or rhetorical questions that weaken objectivity. Use measured, confident claims instead.
- Revise in focused passes
  - Do separate edits for (1) global structure/thesis, (2) paragraph unity and transitions, (3) sentence clarity/style, (4) grammar/typos.
- Use targeted grammar practice
  - Work on common problem areas you showed (article use, word choice, plural/singular, spelling). Short, focused quizzes or apps (e.g., grammar exercises, Corpus searches) help.
- Get feedback and reflect
  - Share drafts with a peer or teacher, then apply only 2–3 pieces of feedback per revision. Track which errors repeat and make an error log.
- Short exercises to try now (10–15 minutes each)
  - Rewrite your thesis as a single sentence that previews 2–3 reasons.
  - Take one paragraph and write one tight topic sentence that links to your thesis.
  - Edit a paragraph for concision: cut 10% of words without losing meaning.

Quick diagnostic recap of your essay (very brief)
- Strengths: clear position, reasonable structure, relevant ideas (education, efficiency, new industries).
- Main areas to improve: thesis needs to be sharper and preview main points; topic sentences should link more clearly to that thesis; paragraphs should avoid mixing ideas and rhetorical questions; tighten language and correct small spelling errors (e.g., “workers,” “or”/“orr”).

Next step — choose targets so we follow the revision workflow
Please answer these two quick choices:
1) Which 1–2 priorities should I focus on during this session?
   - clarity
   - connection to the thesis / argument strength
   - concision / academic tone
   - avoiding hedging

2) Do you want to:
   - revise the thesis first, then a topic sentence and that paragraph, or
   - skip the thesis and revise one topic sentence and paragraph only?

Also: which topic sentence do you want to work on?
A. "Indeed, automation is transforming industries—it replaces many jobs that do not require professional knowledge or mental input."
B. "However, society is developing rapidly, which means the educational level is improving, so humans will no longer rely on manual labor to make a living."

Would you like to try rewriting the chosen sentence (one short attempt) now, or would you prefer I propose a model after you confirm priorities?
