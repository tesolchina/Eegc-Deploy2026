### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- **Content and Ideas: 17/25**  
  The essay sets a clear position on automation’s impact—arguing its drawbacks outweigh benefits. It acknowledges opposing views, but ideas are somewhat repetitive and development is basic. References to a “recent survey” are vague, and support lacks detail.
- **Organization: 15/25**  
  Structure follows intro–body–conclusion, but paragraph unity and logical flow are weak. Sentences sometimes jump between points or repeat ideas without transitions. Topic sentences do not clearly connect to the thesis.
- **Vocabulary: 15/25**  
  Vocabulary is relevant to the topic, but there are frequent word choice errors (“outweight”, “cherry bullet”, awkward phrasing). Limited variety and some inaccuracy.
- **Grammar: 13/25**  
  Frequent grammar issues: agreement problems (“fewer number of employee”), word form errors (“outweight”), repeated words (“revealed revealed”), awkward/incorrect use of prepositions, run-on sentences, and unclear idioms.

- **Original Essay Total: 60/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- **Content and Ideas: 21/25**  
  The revision provides more examples and statistics (ILO report, automotive study), includes a more nuanced counterargument, and develops points in more depth. Reasoning is clearer, and evidence is more specific. Some repetition remains, but overall content is strengthened.
- **Organization: 20/25**  
  Structure is improved, with more clearly differentiated body paragraphs (unemployment, labor rights, technological opportunities). Transitions (“On the other hand,” “For instance,” etc.) are used, but some sentences still lack smooth flow and unity can be further enhanced.
- **Vocabulary: 20/25**  
  Variety and precision are improved; topic-specific terms (“International Labour Organization,” “assembly line jobs,” etc.) are included; fewer word choice errors though some awkwardness and repetition persist.
- **Grammar: 18/25**  
  Sentence structure and accuracy have improved (fewer errors like subject-verb disagreement, pluralization, and article use). Some mistakes (“employee” not plural, “cannot not compare,” etc.) and awkward constructions remain but are less frequent.

- **Revised Essay Total: 79/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +19 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - More detailed evidence and examples referenced (ILO report, automotive robot statistics)
  - Counterarguments and rebuttals are added (“some technological companies have to hire more labour…”)
  - More precise vocabulary and transition words enhance clarity
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Consistency and unity: Certain sentences still lack cohesion within paragraphs
  - Some grammatical errors, awkward wording, and repetition persist, especially in supporting sentences and transitions

---

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 26**
- **Conversation Quality:**  
  The student initiates targeted questions (“How to revise thesis?”, “Can you provide examples?”, “Do you find grammatical mistakes?”), receives detailed, scaffolded feedback from the AI, and requests clarification or further examples repeatedly. Exchanges are purposeful but mostly focused on guidance rather than critical negotiation or explicit self-editing.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation: 4/5**  
  The student engages actively, with over 15 exchanges. Questions span thesis, paragraphing, topic sentences, elaboration, grammar, and transitions. The student mostly asks for examples/templates and quick fixes but does not consistently probe the AI’s reasoning in depth or debate feedback.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions: 3/5**  
  Student often requests AI corrections and examples, but rarely challenges, evaluates, modifies, or rejects suggestions. Little evidence of negotiating or justifying changes independently; revisions seem mostly AI-led.
- **Refining Process: 3/5**  
  Student iteratively requests examples/clarifications and applies some feedback in the revision, but there’s limited evidence of deep multi-cycle refinement or independent editing decisions. Revision appears linear (request-change-apply) rather than multi-staged.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 10/15**

---

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- **Increased content sophistication:** Student added examples, counterarguments, and statistics based on AI prompts (Revised: “According to a recent report…robot adoption led to a 15% decrease…”).
- **Ability to solicit focused guidance:** Student asked relevant questions about thesis revision, paragraphing, grammar, and transitions, showing awareness of writing components.
- **Adoption of academic conventions:** Revision included more formal vocabulary, transition words, and structured argument (e.g., “On the other hand…”).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- **Critical independence in revision:** The revision process is heavily AI-led; student should practice more autonomous editing and critical evaluation (e.g., justifying acceptance/rejection, experimenting with own wording).
- **Deeper paragraph unity and flow:** Some paragraphs remain loosely connected with repetitive or awkward transitions. More attention needed to coherence and idea development.
- **Refined grammar and style:** While improved, errors persist; the student should self-edit for subject-verb agreement, word form, and avoid repetitive/awkward phrases.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision: Good**  
  Student provided context through targeted questions, but not a full course framing or explicit articulation of writing goals.
- **Strategic Planning: Needs Improvement**  
  Student relied on sequential AI prompts instead of outlining a multi-step strategy or revision priorities.
- **Critical Evaluation: Needs Improvement**  
  Limited evidence of critical challenge, questioning AI rationale, or independent acceptance/rejection of feedback.
- **Independent Editing: Developing**  
  Some revision based on AI input, but process is largely AI-driven with little unaided editing or experimentation.

---

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. **Essay Writing:**  
   Continue practicing organizational and paragraph unity; re-read paragraphs for clarity and flow; self-edit for grammar and awkwardness before relying on AI correction.
2. **AI Collaboration:**  
   Actively justify, adapt, or challenge AI suggestions; try drafting multiple versions before seeking AI feedback; experiment with independent revision.
3. **Overall Performance:**  
   Focus on integrating feedback, refining grammar, and developing independent editing skills. Track changes in each draft to spot persistent issues and learn from process.

---

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student is responsive and eager for examples and corrections, showing motivation but possible over-reliance on model answers.
- Recommend scaffolding tasks that require the student to critique AI output, propose own revisions, and reflect on their revision choices.
- Encourage explicit metacognitive activities (why a change was made; what learning is happening) to deepen independent editing and critical thinking.

Automation- powering tool to change the of global employment.
Automation has been a controversial topic in the world. Some advocates claim that automation would pose the positive effect on global employment prospects. On the contrary, some citizens hold some reservation of the impact of automation and they are worried that it may undermine the global employment prospects. From my perspective, the drawbacks of using automation absolutely outweight the benefits of using.
Automation would lead to a problem of unemployment. Automation can lower the production cost, & for the reason that we only require labour to produce same amout of outputs under automation. In light of this circumstances, the global companies would hire fewer number of employee for producing a good. Hence, there are more residents would suffer from this unemployment, based on this situation. A recent survey revealed revealed that more people are tortured by unemployment due to automation. Therefore, automation would pose a detrimental influence on global employment prospects.

Some people contend that automation can improve the efficiency as well as companies' financial pressure due to decreased cost under automation. Undoubtedly, this statement seems flawless at first glance, but this statement definitely ignore the extremely negative effect to the employees. From the companies and customers' angle, this statement is right. However, decreased cost and enhanced efficiency also reduce the demand of global labour which will damage labour's bargaining power and exploit labour's rights. In light of this technological shift, employees would earn less salaries and lack the power to get more job allowance. Finally, the job market would become more competitive due to Automation. Hence, automation would undermine the global employment prospects. 
All in all, automation would pose an irreversible consequence to global employment prospects, so lots of employees may suffer from unemployment owing to automation. For this reason, it is crucial to regulate the automation and suppress its growth rate which would be a cherry bullet to relieve the concern of global employment prospects which caused by automation.

Revised:
Automation- a powerful tool to change the nature of global employment.

Automation is a controversial issue worldwide because its effects on employment have generated intense discussion.Some advocates argue that automation will have a positive impact on global employment prospects. On the contrary, some citizens hold some reservations about the impact of automation and they are worried that it may undermine the global employment prospects. From my perspective, the drawbacks of using automation absolutely outweigh the benefits of using it.

Automation reduces the demand for workers in many industries, resulting in higher unemployment rates worldwide.Automation can lower the production cost.For instance,  the company is installing robots to cut costs, which means fewer people are required to produce the same output.In light of these circumstances, the global companies would hire fewer employee to produce a good. Hence, there are more residents would suffer from this unemployment, based on this situation. According to a recent report by the International Labour Organization, automation has led to a 10% decrease in manufacturing jobs in several countries. Therefore, automation would pose a detrimental influence on global employment prospects.

Some opponents contend that automation can improve  production efficiency as well as reduce companies' financial pressure due to decreased costs under automation. Undoubtedly, this statement seems flawless at first glance, but this statement definitely ignores the adverse effect on the employees. From the companies' and customers' angle, this statement is right. However, decreased cost and enhanced efficiency also reduce the demand for global labour which will damage labour's bargaining power and exploit labour's rights. In light of this technological shift, employees would earn lower salaries and lack the power to get higher job allowances. Finally, the job market would become more competitive due to the development of automation. Hence, automation would undermine the global employment prospects. .

On the other hand, some people argue that automation creates new opportunities in the technology sector. Indisputably, some technological companies have to hire more labour to the development of automation.However, the increased amount of hired workers cannot not compare with the increased number of unemployed people.For example,By replacing manual labor with machines, automation contributes directly to rising unemployment rates.Furthermore, many factories now use robots to perform tasks previously done by human workers. In the automotive industry, one study found that robot adoption led to a 15% decrease in assembly line jobs over the past decade.Additionally, car factories replacing humans with robots. In real life, more and more vehicle companies try to use AI robots for manufacturing electric cars such as using robots to combine some engines.Consequently, lots of employees working in this industry would suffer from large scale of unemployment.Hence, it is illustrated that automation would have an nuanced positive impact on employment, but we cannot ignore the catastrophic effect on future employment prospects.


All in all, automation would pose an irreversible consequence to global employment prospects, so lots of employees may suffer from unemployment owing to automation. For this reason, it is crucial to regulate the automation and suppress its growth rate which would  help  address concern about global employment prospects which caused by automation.

- *Areas to Improve*: The thesis statement is a bit unclear and lacks specifics about the main points. The argument can be more logically developed and focused.

**B. Organization**
- *Strengths*: There is a basic structure: introduction, body paragraphs with reasons/examples, and a conclusion.
- *Areas to Improve*: Topic sentences don’t consistently connect to the thesis; the organization could be clearer (sometimes sentences repeat ideas). Paragraphs could be more unified.

**C. Evidence & Development**
- *Strengths*: You mention “lower production cost” and a survey about unemployment.
- *Areas to Improve*: Supporting details can be more detailed and clear. Some statements lack explanation or precise evidence.

**D. Language Use**
- *Strengths*: Your vocabulary choices relate to the topic, and you attempt some variety.
- *Areas to Improve*: There are frequent grammar mistakes (sentence structure, plural/singular forms, word choice). Some sentences are wordy or unclear (“cherry bullet”?). Need to fix repeated words and awkward phrases.

---

## 3. STUDENT PRIORITY SELECTION

**Based on the diagnosis above, which issue(s) do you most want to focus on today:**
- Thesis Clarity and Argument Strength

---

# Step 1: THESIS STATEMENT REVISION

## 1. Share Your Current Thesis

Here is your current thesis statement from the essay:

> *From my perspective, the drawbacks of using automation absolutely outweight the benefits of using.*

Let’s look at how to **revise it for clarity, strength, and focus.**

---

## 2. Constructive Feedback:

- **Clarity**: It’s clear you take a side against automation, but *why* is not stated. The reader should know your reasons (main points) upfront.
- **Strength**: “Absolutely” is strong, but use formal, confident language; avoid overly emotional or vague wording (“outweight the benefits of using” is unclear).
- **Focus**: Preview main points; make your argument specific.

## 3. Example of a Strong Thesis

Here’s a model for reference:

> “Despite some potential benefits, automation has a harmful impact on global employment, as it increases unemployment and weakens workers’ rights.”

**See how it:**  
- Clearly answers the question  
- Says *why* automation is harmful (unemployment, weaker rights)  
- Uses confident, formal language

*Time:* 2025-11-18T04:21:09.646Z

**Assistant:** Great question! Elaboration is all about **developing** and **clarifying** your argument in the body paragraph after the topic sentence. Here are some **contents you can add in the elaboration** to make your paragraph more detailed, convincing, and clear:

---

### 1. **Explanation of Your Point**
- Restate your topic sentence in different words and **explain why it’s true**.
- For example: If your topic sentence is about unemployment rising due to automation, explain *how* automation causes jobs to disappear.

---

### 2. **Evidence or Examples**
- **Facts, statistics, or surveys:** E.g., “According to a recent report by the International Labour Organization, automation has led to a 10% decrease in manufacturing jobs in several countries.”
- **Real-world examples:** Describe a company or an industry affected by automation (e.g., car factories replacing humans with robots).
- **Anecdotes:** A brief story about a worker who lost their job due to new technology.

---

### 3. **Analysis or Reasoning**
- **Answer the question**: Why does this evidence support your topic sentence?
- **Show the connection** between corporate decisions (like cost savings) and job losses.

---

### 4. **Counterpoint & Response**
- Mention an opposing argument briefly (“Some may argue that automation creates new tech jobs”)
- **Respond** by showing why those new jobs don’t help most workers or aren’t enough to offset the losses.

---

### 5. **Impact or Consequences**
- What happens *because* of this problem (e.g., higher unemployment rates, weaker bargaining power, social instability)?
- Show the **result** for individuals, families, or society.

---

## Guiding Questions for Elaboration

- **Can you give a real example or statistic about job loss from automation?**
- **How does automation specifically affect workers in different industries?**
- **What problems do unemployed workers face because of automation?**

*Time:* 2025-11-18T04:21:16.841Z

**You:** How to revise my topic sentences ?

*Time:* 2025-11-18T04:21:54.630Z

**Assistant:** Great question! **Revising your topic sentences** is an important part of making your essay well-organized and clear. Here’s a step-by-step guide, tailored for you, and I’ll support you through each stage.

---

# How to Revise Your Topic Sentences

## 1. Connect Clearly to Your Thesis

- Your topic sentence should show how THIS paragraph supports your main argument (your thesis).
- Read your thesis. What *specific point* does this paragraph explain or prove?
- Example: If your thesis says automation increases unemployment and weakens workers’ rights, your topic sentence can focus on one of those points.

---

## 2. Make Sure It’s Focused

- Your topic sentence should **only** introduce the main idea of the paragraph—not general information or too many points at once.

---

## 3. Use Clear, Confident Language

- Avoid phrases like “some people think…” for your own argument paragraph.
- Use strong, direct wording (e.g., “Automation leads to widespread unemployment…”).

---

## 4. Avoid Repetition

- Don’t repeat the thesis word-for-word. Each topic sentence should add new information but still clearly support your thesis.
- Don’t start every topic sentence the same way (“Automation would…”). Try to vary your vocabulary.

---

## 5. Preview the Paragraph’s Content

- A good topic sentence often hints at what evidence/explanation will follow in the paragraph.
- Example: “By reducing the need for human labor, automation increases unemployment rates among factory workers around the world.”

---

# Step-by-Step Revision Example

**Original topic sentence:**
> Automation would lead to a problem of unemployment.

**Diagnosis:**  
- It’s clear, but it’s a bit general.
- It doesn’t connect directly to your thesis with specifics.
- Could hint at evidence: How? Who’s affected?

**Improved topic sentence:**
> Automation reduces the demand for workers in many industries, resulting in higher unemployment rates worldwide.

See how this version:
- Connects to your thesis (“reduces demand for workers”)
- Is clear and confident
- Previews what evidence will follow (“in many industries,” “higher unemployment rates”)

---

# Guided Prompts for Your Revision

**Would you like to try revising your topic sentence for the chosen paragraph now?**  
Here are some sentence starters to help:
- “Automation’s impact on workplace staffing has caused…”
- “As automation replaces human roles, unemployment has…”
- “One major consequence of widespread automation is…”

Feel free to write your revised topic sentence here. I’ll give you feedback and help you make it even stronger!

---

**If you want more examples or have a different paragraph to focus on, just let me know! I’m here to guide you step by step.**

Would you like to try now?

*Time:* 2025-11-18T04:22:02.308Z

**You:** can you give me more examples ?

*Time:* 2025-11-18T04:22:51.312Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely, I’m happy to help! Here are **more examples of topic sentences** you could use for a body paragraph about how automation impacts employment. Each one is designed to be clear, confident, and connected to a thesis statement arguing that automation is harmful to global employment prospects.

---

### Example Topic Sentences:  
*(Choose one that matches your paragraph, or use them for inspiration!)*

1. **“Automation is rapidly replacing human workers, resulting in significant job losses across manufacturing and service industries.”**

2. **“As companies adopt automated technologies to increase efficiency, many employees are left without work or opportunities for retraining.”**

3. **“The growing reliance on robotics and artificial intelligence in the workplace has triggered a surge in unemployment rates in both developing and developed countries.”**

4. **“By minimizing the need for manual labor, automation not only cuts costs but also undermines the job security of millions of workers worldwide.”**

5. **“One major drawback of automation is the reduction in demand for traditional labor, which causes widespread economic hardship and inequality.”**

6. **“While automation can improve productivity for businesses, it often does so at the expense of workers who face displacement and uncertain futures.”**

7. **“As machines take over tasks once performed by people, the competition for remaining jobs becomes fiercer, leaving many unemployed or underemployed.”**

8. **“Automation’s expansion threatens labor rights by making workers more vulnerable to layoffs and decreasing their bargaining power.”**

---

**Tips for Your Revision:**  
- Make sure your topic sentence sets up *what the paragraph will prove or discuss*.
- If your thesis is about *unemployment* and *weaker workers’ rights*, each topic sentence should link to one of these ideas.

---

**Next Step:**  
Do any of these examples fit your paragraph’s focus?  
Would you like to try writing your own topic sentence now, or get feedback on one you have?

*(Just type your idea, and I’ll help you improve it!)*

*Time:* 2025-11-18T04:22:56.990Z

**You:** Do you think the paragraphing is appropriate?

*Time:* 2025-11-18T04:23:50.563Z

**Assistant:** Great question—and it’s an important one for essay revision! Let’s look at **your essay’s paragraphing** using key writing criteria: unity, coherence, and development.

---

## Diagnostic Feedback: Paragraphing

**Strengths:**
- Your essay follows a basic structure: introduction, two body paragraphs (each presenting a different point), and a conclusion. This is a good starting framework!
- Each paragraph attempts to discuss a separate idea (e.g., negatives of automation, counterarguments, overall impact).

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Unity & Focus**
   - Some sentences repeat ideas or introduce new points abruptly within the same paragraph.
   - For example, your first body paragraph focuses on unemployment, but moves quickly from cost savings to hiring fewer employees to “a recent survey.” The relationship between these points could be explained or organized better.

2. **Paragraph Purpose**
   - Each body paragraph should focus on a *single clear aspect* of your argument.
   - Example: First paragraph = automation increases unemployment (with explanation and evidence).
   - Second paragraph = automation weakens labor rights/bargaining power (with explanation and evidence).

3. **Coherence & Transitions**
   - Some sentences and ideas are not fully connected (e.g., “A recent survey revealed…people are tortured by unemployment due to automation” appears suddenly without a lead-in or explanation).
   - Consider adding linking phrases or sentences that guide the reader from one idea to the next.

4. **Topic Sentences**
   - Make sure each body paragraph begins with a strong topic sentence that clearly supports your thesis.
   - Avoid starting paragraphs with generalities or repeating points.

5. **Conclusion**
   - The conclusion should summarize your main points and restate your thesis in a new way.
   - Avoid introducing new ideas in the conclusion (“cherry bullet” is unclear; keep your summary focused).

---

## **How to Improve Paragraphing**

- **Plan your essay:**

**You:** Can you provide me some examples

*Time:* 2025-11-18T04:24:28.511Z

**Assistant:** Absolutely! Here are helpful **examples for revising your body paragraph’s topic sentence and for adding strong elaboration**, tailored for an essay arguing that **automation negatively affects global employment prospects**.

---

# 1. **Example Topic Sentences**

Choose or adapt one for your paragraph:

---

**A. Focused on Unemployment:**

- *“Automation’s rise in industries such as manufacturing and services has led to significant job losses for workers worldwide.”*
- *“By replacing manual labor with machines, automation contributes directly to rising unemployment rates.”*
- *“One major consequence of automation is the displacement of workers, resulting in higher levels of unemployment across the globe.”*

---

**B. Focused on Labor Rights/Bargaining Power:**

- *“Automation doesn’t just increase unemployment—it also weakens workers’ bargaining power and job security.”*
- *“As companies invest more in technology, employees face reduced rights and struggle to negotiate fair wages.”*

---

> **Tip:**  
A strong topic sentence directly states the main point of the paragraph and connects with your thesis argument.

---

# 2. **Example Elaboration (Supporting Sentences)**

Here’s how you might develop the paragraph **after a topic sentence about unemployment:**

---

**Topic Sentence Example:**  
- *“By replacing manual labor with machines, automation contributes directly to rising unemployment rates.”*

**Elaboration:**

- *For example, many factories now use robots to perform tasks previously done by human workers. In the automotive industry, one study found that robot adoption led to a 15% decrease in assembly line jobs over the past decade.*
  
- *With fewer positions available, many employees struggle to find new opportunities, often facing long periods without work. This trend is particularly severe in countries that heavily rely on manufacturing, where entire communities may be affected.*
  
- *Although some argue that automation creates jobs in technology sectors, these roles often require advanced skills that many displaced workers do not possess. As a result, most people who lose their jobs to automation are unable to transition to new employment.*
  
- *Therefore, automation’s overall effect is a reduction in job opportunities and increased economic insecurity for many workers worldwide.*

---

# 3. **Sample Paragraph (Structure Only)**

**Topic Sentence:**  
Automation’s rise in industries such as manufacturing and services has led to significant job losses for workers worldwide.

**Supporting Sentences/Elaboration:**  
Many factories now replace employees with machines that work faster and more efficiently. For instance, the International Labour Organization reported that automation accounted for a 10% decline in manufacturing jobs in Southeast Asia between 2015 and 2020. This means many workers have been forced out of their jobs, and new positions that require technical expertise are often unavailable to them. As automation continues, more people risk losing stable employment and facing financial hardship.

---

# 4. **Guided Sentence Starters**

- “A recent study showed that…”
- “As a result,…”
- “For example,…”
- “On the other hand,…”
- “This means that…”

Let’s focus on **clarity, formal style, and variety**. I’ll give you guidance and then some examples—you can try revising it yourself, or choose one to adapt!

---

## Guidance:
- Use more precise language: “around the world” instead of “in the world.”
- Mention *why* it’s controversial (give a hint of the debate’s nature).
- Use stronger vocabulary for academic style (“subject of debate,” “sparked discussion,” etc.).

---

## Example Improvements:

1. **“Automation has become a highly debated issue worldwide, as its impact on employment continues to spark concern among many.”**

2. **“Across the globe, automation remains a controversial topic due to its significant influence on job markets and workers’ livelihoods.”**

3. **“The increasing use of automation has generated widespread debate, particularly regarding its effects on global employment prospects.”**

---

**Would you like to try revising the sentence yourself, using some of these ideas?  
You could combine:**
- “Automation”
- “debate” or “controversy”
- “global” or “worldwide”
- A phrase explaining *why* it’s controversial (“impact on jobs,” etc.)

---

**Example revision you might try:**
> Automation is a controversial issue worldwide because its effects on employment have generated intense discussion.
