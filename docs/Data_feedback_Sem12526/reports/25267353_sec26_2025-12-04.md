            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing the detailed training and interaction assessment. Based on the evidence from the chat and essay drafts, here is a concise summary addressing the current situation and next steps:

---

### Summary of Current Status

- **Thesis Revision**: The student has not yet produced or pasted a concrete revised thesis statement despite multiple requests and clear revision guidance.
- **Topic Sentence Revision**: Similarly, no revised topic sentence has been submitted; placeholders continue to appear instead of actual text.
- **Body Paragraph Revision**: The student has expressed an intention to revise body paragraph #1 but without following through with actual revisions.
- **Engagement with AI Suggestions**: The student consistently avoids performing the revision steps and instead replies with “pretend” or “bla bla bla” placeholders.
- **Resulting Feedback**: The revised essay submitted contains placeholders with no tangible improvement; grammar, vocabulary, and organization remain uncorrected.

---

### Recommendations for Advancing with This Student

1. **Require Concrete Deliverables before Moving Forward**  
   - Instruct the student explicitly to paste the fully revised thesis statement in the chat, following the scaffolded guidance.
   - Only after satisfactory revision and confirmation of the thesis should the student move on to revising the topic sentence.
   - Finally, require an actual revised paragraph with corrected grammar, vocabulary, and clearer examples (no placeholders).

2. **Emphasize Incremental Revision Steps**  
   - Make it clear that the revision process is sequential (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph).
   - Provide short, targeted feedback after each step to encourage iteration.
   - Reinforce that “pretending” to revise is not sufficient.

3. **Offer Additional Support Options**  
   - Suggest a short live tutorial or virtual meeting to walk the student through the revision process in real time.
   - Provide annotated example revisions illustrating how to move from original to improved thesis, topic sentence, and paragraph.

4. **Encourage Reflective Engagement**  
   - Ask the student to explain in their own words which AI suggestions they find useful or challenging.
   - Require the student to justify acceptance or rejection of specific AI feedback to improve critical thinking and collaboration.

5. **Focus on Grammar and Formality**  
   - Advise the student to review specific grammar points raised (subject-verb agreement, verb forms, clarity).
   - Encourage use of more formal academic vocabulary in revisions.

---

### Closing Note

At this stage, the priority is for the student to produce *actual* written revisions based on the assistant’s scaffolded advice. Without concrete text in the chat, the assistant and instructor cannot properly assess the student’s learning or collaboration skills. The placeholders hinder meaningful progress.

Requiring stepwise submission of the revised thesis, then topic sentence, then paragraph—with focused feedback at each step—will help the student engage actively with the AI and improve the essay effectively.

If you need, I can help draft a specific message or assignment prompt for the student that instructs these steps clearly and sets expectations for the next delivery. Would you like me to do that?

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The essay takes a clear, balanced stance (“I partly agree…”) and develops two relevant ideas (citizens pressuring government; individual green habits). Examples (voting, protests, consumer choice) support the position, though claims are general and could use more specific evidence.
- Organization: 20/25 - The draft has a standard structure (introduction, two body paragraphs, conclusion) and logical progression. Transitions and internal coherence are adequate but sometimes repetitive.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Vocabulary is generally adequate for the topic (“clean energy,” “pollution,” “plastic”), but word choice is sometimes informal and repetitive.
- Grammar: 18/25 - Sentence-level errors and informal constructions appear (e.g., “But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action,” “so nothing happen”), which reduce clarity but do not fully obscure meaning.
- **Original Essay Total: 77/100**

Evidence quoted from original essay:
- Thesis/stance: “I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government…”
- Grammar/clarity issues: “But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action… so nothing happen.”

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 15/25 - The revised file contains placeholders and has not supplied a concrete revised thesis (“blablabla...(revised thesis statement here)”). Much of the intended revision work is missing or signaled with “bla bla bla,” so the essay’s clarity and completeness are reduced.
- Organization: 14/25 - Placeholders disrupt the logical flow. The structure exists but is not meaningfully improved; planned revisions are not present to assess.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - No substantive vocabulary improvements visible; informal placeholders (“bla bla bla…”) replace actual revisions.
- Grammar: 13/25 - Original grammatical issues remain in the unchanged portions; placeholders make it impossible to judge any corrective work on grammar.
- **Revised Essay Total: 57/100**

Evidence quoted from revised essay:
- Missing thesis: “Climate change is a very serious problem ... blablabla...(revised thesis statement here)”
- Placeholder and non-revision text: “let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences move on bla bla bla …” and “revise the rest of body paragraph #1 ...”

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -20 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None demonstrable in the submitted revised essay. The student indicated intent to revise but did not provide concrete revisions.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Provide a complete, tightened thesis that previews the two main mechanisms (policy pressure; consumer/social-norm influence).
  - Replace placeholders with an actual revised topic sentence(s) tied to the thesis.
  - Implement the assistant’s stepwise edits to the first body paragraph (clear topic sentence, tightened supporting sentences, smoother transitions).
  - Correct recurring grammar errors (subject-verb agreement, tense, sentence fragments) and raise formality level.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 9 messages** (assistant and student turns combined).
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided structured, pedagogical guidance (stepwise plan to revise thesis, topic sentences, and paragraphs). The student’s responses mostly declined to perform the requested edits and used placeholders (“let's pretend…”, “bla bla bla”), so there is little evidence of substantive iterative work or critical evaluation of the AI suggestions.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Developing.  
  Justification: The chat includes multiple exchanges (9 messages) and the assistant gave detailed scaffolding (e.g., checklists, step plan). However, the student did not follow through with substantive revisions or extended engagement. Evidence: assistant asks for a revised thesis repeatedly; student replies with “let's pretend we have revised…” rather than pasting a revision.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - Basic.  
  Justification: The chat shows little evidence that the student critically evaluated suggestions. The student repeatedly bypassed concrete revision tasks instead of engaging with the assistant’s feedback (e.g., never posted a revised thesis for evaluation).
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - Basic.  
  Justification: The assistant requested iterative steps (revise thesis → revise topic sentence → revise paragraph), but the student did not provide iterations. The student signaled intent to “pretend” to revise rather than produce revised text or ask clarifying questions that would drive multiple meaningful revision cycles.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 7/15**

Specific chat evidence:
- Assistant request: “Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?” — student did provide original thesis once.
- Repeated assistant prompt: “Please paste your revised thesis statement.” — student responded “let's pretend we have revised the thesis statementand move on bla bla bla ...” rather than providing revision.
- Student refusal to engage: “ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1 \n bla bla bla” — indicates avoidance of concrete steps.

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The original essay shows a coherent, relevant stance and awareness of the main mechanisms by which individuals can affect climate policy and behavior (evidence: original thesis and both body paragraphs).
- The student engaged in the chat and responded to the assistant’s prompts (did provide the original thesis and indicated which paragraph to revise).
- The AI assistant provided a clear, scaffolded revision plan and actionable advice (checklists, specific wording hints).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- The student must produce concrete revisions rather than placeholders; follow the assistant’s step sequence by pasting an actual revised thesis, revised topic sentence, and revised paragraph.
- Improve grammar and sentence-level accuracy (e.g., revise “so nothing happen” → “so nothing happens”; “maybe just listen a little” → “may only give limited attention”).
- Strengthen evidence and specificity: cite concrete examples or statistics where possible and specify mechanisms (e.g., “through voting, protests, and public campaigns”).
- Engage more critically with AI suggestions—accept, adapt, or reject proposals with reasons and attempt multiple revision iterations.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student provided the original essay and chose a paragraph, but did not supply the revised thesis or revised topic sentence when requested. Evidence: repeated assistant requests for the revised thesis were not met.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The assistant provided a clear multi-step plan, but the student did not follow or enact it.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - There is no record of the student evaluating specific AI suggestions or explaining why they accepted/rejected any.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - No substantive independent edits were submitted; the revised essay contains placeholders rather than edited text.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Finalize and paste an actual revised thesis that (a) states the degree of agreement, and (b) previews the two mechanisms with clear language (e.g., “I partly agree: citizens can pressure governments to adopt policies through voting and protest, and individual choices can influence markets and social norms, though their direct impact is smaller.”).
2. Revise one topic sentence to match the thesis precisely (avoid “most important” if taking a balanced stance), paste it, and ask the assistant for a focused check.
3. Implement concrete edits to body paragraph #1: tighten topic sentence, make each supporting sentence explicitly connect to the mechanism, fix grammar, and include one specific example or citation if possible.
4. When working with the AI, produce and paste each new draft/version in the chat so the assistant can give targeted feedback; explicitly accept/reject AI suggestions with a reason.
5. Address grammar systematically—run a focused pass on sentence-level errors the assistant flagged (subject-verb agreement, verb tense, articles, sentence fragments).

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student did not complete the three required revision tasks: revised thesis statement, revised a topic sentence, and revised a body paragraph. The submitted “revised” essay contains placeholders indicating intent but not actual work. Grade and feedback should reflect that the assignment is incomplete.
- Recommend requiring the student to resubmit with the explicit, stepwise revisions requested in the chat (revised thesis first, then topic sentence, then paragraph), so instructors can assess learning and AI collaboration skills properly.
- Consider a short formative meeting or guided lab where the student is walked through making the three concrete revisions in real time.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:

*Time:* 2025-12-04T10:00:05.076Z

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-12-02T06:05:10.319Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-12-02T06:10:11.153Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I see your current thesis at the end of your message. Before we move on, let’s work on strengthening it.

First, quick feedback on the thesis you shared:
- Strengths: It answers the question (you partly agree) and identifies two main ideas you develop in the essay (citizens influencing government; individuals’ green habits matter too). That gives a clear position and a basic preview.
- Areas to improve:
  - Wordiness and repetition (phrases like “I believe…”, “I also think…” can be tightened).
  - Uncertainty and hedging — be confident and precise (avoid extra qualifiers).
  - The preview could be clearer and more specific about how each point works (e.g., influence policy vs. influence markets/social norms).
  - Use more academic phrasing and stronger verbs (e.g., “pressure governments to adopt policies” rather than “influence the government”).

A simple revision plan (not a full sentence — use this to rewrite):
- Start with a clear stance: “I partly agree…” plus a brief qualification.
- State Reason 1: citizens can pressure governments to change policy (mention mechanism: voting, protest, public pressure).
- State Reason 2: individual lifestyle choices influence consumer demand and social norms (but add that impact is smaller in scale).
- Use confident, direct language and avoid “I think” or “maybe.”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using that plan? Send your new version and I’ll give specific feedback. (We’ll only move to the topic sentence after you confirm you’re satisfied with the revised thesis.)

*Time:* 2025-12-02T06:10:22.673Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statementand move on bla bla bla ...

*Time:* 2025-12-02T06:23:34.057Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s continue step by step. First, I need to confirm the revised thesis before we move on.

Step 1 — Thesis
- Please paste your revised thesis statement (the one you “pretend” you revised), or confirm it here.
- Quick checklist to check yourself against as you post it:
  - Does it clearly answer the question (extent of agreement)?
  - Does it preview the main points or structure of your essay?
  - Is the language confident and precise (no “I think/maybe”)?

Once you paste or confirm the revised thesis, tell me if you’re satisfied with it. We won’t move on until you are.

Step 2 — Choose a paragraph / topic sentence
- Which body paragraph would you like to work on: the paragraph about influencing government (paragraph 1) or the paragraph about personal lifestyle changes (paragraph 2)?
- Paste the current topic sentence for that paragraph (or confirm the one in your draft). I’ll give focused feedback on how well it links to your revised thesis.

Initial feedback on the original topic sentence (from your draft): “The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”
- Strengths: Clear claim; relevant to your thesis; sets up examples (protests, voting).
- Issues to fix to match a strong academic essay:
  - “Most important” may overstate or conflict with a balanced thesis (e.g., “partly agree”). Consider milder words (a key/a significant/one important).
  - “Influencing the government and politicians” is vague — tighten to the mechanism (e.g., pressure for policy change, voting, public campaigns).
  - Make the link to your thesis explicit: show this is one of the main ways individuals matter.

Hints to revise the topic sentence (do not copy full sentences from me — use these ideas to rewrite):
- Replace “most important” with a measured qualifier: “a key,” “a significant,” or “an effective.”
- Specify the mechanism: use phrases like “by pressuring governments to adopt stricter environmental policies” or “through voting, protest, and public advocacy.”
- Tie it back to thesis preview: indicate this is how individuals influence systemic change.

Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence now? Paste your revised version and I’ll give specific comments. (We will only move to Step 3 after you are happy with the new topic sentence.)

Step 3 — Revising the rest of the paragraph (next)
- After you post the revised topic sentence, we’ll adjust the supporting sentences.
- I’ll ask targeted questions such as:
  - Do your examples clearly support the new topic sentence’s mechanism?
  - Is each supporting sentence directly connected to the claim?
  - Where do you need more evidence, clearer explanation, or smoother transitions?
- I will suggest short edits and reordering, but not provide a full rewritten paragraph.

Your turn: paste the revised thesis and say which paragraph you want to work on (and paste its topic sentence).

*Time:* 2025-12-02T06:24:10.285Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences move on  bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-12-04T09:29:53.152Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s continue with the three-step process. Step 1 is mandatory, so first I need to see your revised thesis.

Quick reminder of what I’m looking for in the thesis (and a brief checklist to help you revise):
- Clear stance answering the question (e.g., I partly agree / I agree to a large extent).
- Preview of the main reasons or structure (mention influence on policy and the effect of personal behaviour, with a brief qualification about scale).
- Confident, precise language (no “I think,” “maybe,” or excessive hedging).
- Concise and specific wording (avoid repetition; show the mechanism for each point).

Strengths in your original version: you state a position (partly agree) and you already plan to discuss two main points (citizens pressuring government; individual lifestyle choices). To improve: tighten the language, be confident, and make the preview more specific (e.g., “pressuring governments to adopt policies” and “shaping markets and social norms”).

Now please:
1) Paste your revised thesis statement.
2) Use the quick checklist above to self-assess it, and tell me if you’re satisfied with the revision.

We won’t move to Step 2 until you confirm the thesis is final. When you’re ready to continue, tell me which paragraph you want to work on (the government-influence paragraph or the personal-lifestyle paragraph) and paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence. Would you like to try the revision now?

*Time:* 2025-12-04T09:30:05.822Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1 
 bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-12-04T09:33:16.889Z

**Assistant:** Great — I can help revise paragraph #1. Before we revise the rest of that paragraph, we must finish Steps 1 and 2. So first:

1) Paste your revised thesis statement now (Step 1 — mandatory).
- Quick checklist for your thesis: it answers the question, previews the two main points (how citizens pressure governments; how personal choices shape markets/social norms), and uses confident, precise language (no “I think/maybe”).
- If you want a quick hint for tightening: remove extra hedging, name the mechanisms (e.g., “pressuring governments to adopt stricter policies” and “influencing consumer demand and social norms”), and state your degree of agreement clearly (e.g., “I partly agree”).

2) You said you want paragraph #1 (influencing government). Confirmed. Now paste the topic sentence you want to use for that paragraph (or confirm the original: “The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”)

Quick targeted feedback to help you revise that topic sentence so it matches a stronger thesis:
- Tone: avoid “most important” if your thesis takes a balanced view; use “a key,” “an important,” or “a significant.”
- Be specific about the mechanism: include words/phrases such as “pressuring governments to adopt stricter environmental policies,” “through voting, protests and public advocacy,” or “by shaping policy and public investment.”
- Link it back to your thesis preview: show this is one of the main ways individuals matter at a systemic level.

Do you want to try rewriting the topic sentence now? Paste your new topic sentence and confirm your revised thesis. After you post both, we’ll move to Step 3 and revise the supporting sentences in paragraph #1 with focused questions (e.g., “Does each example clearly support the mechanism in your topic sentence?”).

*Time:* 2025-12-04T09:33:34.218Z
