            ## Contribution Analysis

            Here is a clear, grammatically correct, and developed revision of the paragraph you asked about, integrated into your essay with the thesis sentence we agreed on:

---

Automation is the major trend nowadays which influences many aspects of daily life. Global employment shows both strengths and weaknesses under the background of this trend. AI truly brings convenience, while reducing the pressure of hand-made working tasks and boosting efficiency in different works. The shift of technology brings some serious problems at the same time. Reducing employment in industry and global working prospects potentially affect our lives from big news all over the world to each detail in our homes.

So it is essential to think about how to solve the problem and whether it helps us boost efficiency in the distant future.

Although automation displaces many routine jobs, it ultimately enhances global employment prospects in the long term by creating new industries, raising productivity that stimulates demand, and generating new, higher-skill roles that require human oversight.

In the long term, automation will spur the creation of new industries and roles that help offset job losses in routine sectors. As businesses adopt AI and robotics, demand grows for workers who design, program, maintain, and supervise these systems—positions such as data analysts, robotics technicians, and AI ethicists. New products and services enabled by automation also generate jobs across supply chains, from manufacturing specialized components to providing customer support. Although these roles often require different skills, investment in training and education can help workers transition into them, supporting overall employment growth.

In the long term, this technological shift may enhance global employment by creating new sectors and jobs to support technological ecosystems. As companies develop and deploy automation, they need workers in roles such as software developers, robotics technicians, data analysts, maintenance engineers, and customer support specialists. These positions arise across supply chains and services that accompany new technologies, generating employment opportunities in manufacturing, research and development, and service industries. With appropriate investment in training and education, displaced workers can transition into these new roles, helping to sustain overall employment.

So the prospect of the shift to technology is hopeful in the long term; people need to create a bright future instead of being controlled by AI.

**Notes on the revised paragraph you requested:**

- Changed vague phrases — “may enhance the global employment in some terms” → “may enhance global employment by creating new sectors and jobs.”
- Clarified “new areas” and “new working jobs will born” with concrete examples like “software developers, robotics technicians, data analysts.”
- Added explanation of how these jobs arise throughout the economy and how training can assist displaced workers.
- Corrected grammar and phrasing for clarity and natural flow.

If you want me to help revise the introduction or conclusion next, or focus on grammar patterns so you can apply similar corrections throughout, just let me know!

            ## 🟤 Grading Result *(Hidden from Students)*

            The student completed the required tasks (revised the thesis statement, revised a topic sentence, and revised a body paragraph). Proceeding with the full assessment below.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The essay presents the basic idea that automation both threatens and creates jobs, but the claim is vague and underdeveloped; examples and reasons are not specific.
- Organization: 16/25 - There is a basic paragraph structure (intro, body, conclusion) but weak transitions and unclear topic sentences reduce logical progression.
- Vocabulary: 15/25 - Limited range and some awkward collocations (e.g., "hand-made working tasks," "the shift of the technological"), which reduce clarity.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Frequent errors (subject-verb agreement, article use, plural/singular forms, awkward phrasing) that affect clarity.
- **Original Essay Total: 62/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - Thesis is clear and takes a defensible position: “Although automation displaces many routine jobs, it ultimately enhances global employment prospects in the long term by creating new industries, raising productivity that stimulates demand, and generating new, higher-skill roles that require human oversight.” The essay adds job examples (e.g., data analysts, robotics technicians), improving idea development.
- Organization: 20/25 - Improved paragraph-level coherence where revised, with a clear topic sentence linking to the thesis: “In the long term, automation will spur the creation of new industries and roles that help offset job losses in routine sectors.” However, some earlier paragraphs and the conclusion remain disjointed.
- Vocabulary: 20/25 - More precise, topic-specific terms appear in revised sections (e.g., “data analysts,” “robotics technicians,” “AI ethicists”), though some phrasing elsewhere remains awkward.
- Grammar: 20/25 - Significant grammatical improvements in the revised thesis, topic sentence, and rewritten paragraph. Remaining grammar errors persist in unedited sections (intro and conclusion).
- **Revised Essay Total: 81/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +19 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Clear, specific thesis statement that previews three reasons (quoted above).
  - Stronger topic sentence explicitly linked to the thesis: “In the long term, automation will spur the creation of new industries and roles that help offset job losses in routine sectors.”
  - Rewritten body paragraph with concrete job examples and a statement about training: the paragraph lists roles (“data analysts, robotics technicians, and AI ethicists”) and explains how training can aid transitions.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - The introduction and conclusion still have many grammar and style errors and were not fully revised.
  - Overall essay would benefit from more specific evidence or data (statistics, sources) to strengthen claims.
  - Transitions between paragraphs could be smoother to improve logical flow across the whole essay.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 19**
- **Conversation Quality:** Focused, task-oriented interaction. The student requested grammar help and then followed the assistant’s stepwise plan (revise thesis, revise topic sentence, revise paragraph). The assistant provided models, edits, and explanations; the student accepted and requested further revisions. The chat shows iterative revisions concentrated on specific parts.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 5/5 - Detailed, goal-directed sequence with 19 exchanges. The assistant and student worked through a multi-step revision process (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph) with targeted examples and full-paragraph rewrites.
  - Evidence: long assistant messages outlining plan and multiple rounds of revision; 19-message exchange count.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - Basic. The student largely accepted the assistant’s suggestions and asked for revisions but did not provide much critical evaluation or evidence-based rejection of alternatives.
  - Evidence: After the assistant proposed a revised thesis and paragraph, the student repeatedly asked “Help me revise” or accepted revisions rather than testing alternatives or arguing for different wording.
- **Refining Process**: 4/5 - Proficient. There were multiple iterations: the assistant produced a revised thesis, suggested topic-sentence models, and produced at least two paragraph rewrites. The student requested additional tweaks and accepted progressive edits.
  - Evidence: Assistant inserted the revised thesis, provided three model topic sentences, then rewrote the target paragraph twice (see revised paragraph versions in the chat).

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 11/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Receptiveness to feedback: The student consistently accepted the assistant’s suggested revisions and requested further help (evidence: repeated “Help me revise” requests).
- Use of concrete examples in revised text: The revised paragraph includes specific job types (data analysts, robotics technicians, AI ethicists), which strengthens argumentation.
- Effective iterative process: The student worked through a structured revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph), leading to clear localized improvements.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Critical engagement with AI suggestions: The student should test or question alternatives and explain preferences to develop independent evaluative skills (recommendation: compare two thesis variants and explain the choice).
- Complete essay revision: Focus next on the unedited introduction and conclusion to ensure consistent grammar and flow across the whole essay.
- Add evidence and transitions: Incorporate factual support (data or citations) and smoother transitions between paragraphs to strengthen persuasiveness.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the original essay and clearly stated the revision focus (“Only grammar across the whole essay”), which helped the assistant tailor the plan.
  - Evidence: Student message “Only grammar across the whole essay” and sharing of the full draft.
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student accepted and followed a staged revision plan (thesis → topic sentence → paragraph).
  - Evidence: Assistant’s three-step plan and student’s adherence.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student rarely critiqued or rejected suggestions; mostly accepted the assistant’s edits.
  - Evidence: No clear instances of the student arguing against or selectively rejecting AI suggestions in the chat.
- **Independent Editing**: Developing - The student relied on the assistant for revisions but did engage by asking for and approving edits; more independent rewording and experimentation is recommended.
  - Evidence: Student repeatedly asked for assistant-provided revisions rather than posting their own rephrases.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise the remaining unedited parts (introduction and conclusion) focusing on grammar and clear sentence structure to produce consistent quality across the whole essay.
2. Practice critical comparison: ask the AI for 2–3 alternative thesis or topic-sentence variants, choose one, and explain why you selected it; this builds evaluative skills.
3. Strengthen claims with evidence: include at least one concrete statistic, example, or citation per major claim (e.g., job growth in AI-related fields) and link paragraphs with clearer transition sentences.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student completed the module’s asked tasks: a revised thesis, a revised topic sentence, and a revised body paragraph were produced and included in the revised essay.
- The student shows strong willingness to learn and uses the AI effectively for focused revisions. However, they would benefit from guidance to develop critical evaluation skills (e.g., requiring them to justify acceptance/rejection of AI edits) and from instruction on integrating edits across the whole essay rather than only on selected parts.
- Recommend an in-class exercise where students must produce at least one independent revision before accepting AI suggestions; this will encourage independent editing and critical thinking.

In the distant future, this technological shift truly changes employment rate in different countries. The wide spread use of artificial intelligence make handmade work gradually disappear. All of the rate of employment may show the reducing prospect, which undermines global employment prospect. But working is crucial, and the new creation of high technology needs humanity task at the same time. Otherwise, all the devices may change into a bad situation. So the working aspects in the area of artificial intelligence may widen and improve the employment rate.

In the long term, this technological shift may enhance the global employment in some terms, as it creates new areas and new working jobs will born to support our global working backgrounds.

So the prospect of the shift into technology is hopeful in long term, people need to create and the bright future instead of being controlling by AI.

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

*Time:* 2025-11-30T11:02:41.005Z

**You:** Can you help me revise my grammar mistakes

*Time:* 2025-11-30T12:21:02.554Z

**Assistant:** Great — I can help. Before we start revising, let’s agree your goals and pick specific targets so our work is focused and useful.

1) Quick question about your goals
- What do you most want to improve in this session? (Pick one or two)
  - grammar and sentence accuracy
  - clarity and word choice
  - thesis/argument strength
  - paragraph organization and coherence
  - vocabulary variety

2) Diagnostic feedback (brief)
I read your draft and here’s a short diagnosis using the rubric categories:

- Content & Ideas: Developing (3). Your main idea — that automation both threatens and creates jobs — is present, but the position and development are vague. The essay needs a clearer, more specific claim and better support.
- Organisation & Logical Progression: Developing (3). You have an intro and body paragraphs, but transitions and logical links between sentences are weak. Paragraphs need clearer topic sentences that link to the thesis.
- Vocabulary: Developing (3). Some words are repeated or used imprecisely (e.g., “hand-made working tasks,” “the shift of the technological”). You could choose more natural collocations.
- Grammar & Sentence Structure: Basic (2). Frequent grammar problems: subject-verb agreement, article use, plural/singular mismatches, awkward phrasing, and some missing words. Sentences are often unclear.

Main issues to focus on (suggested)
- Grammar and sentence structure (fix errors and improve clarity)
- Make the thesis clearer and more specific (answers the question and previews main points)
- Strengthen one body paragraph: its topic sentence and supporting sentences so they connect to the thesis

3) Which issue(s) would you like us to work on now?
Please pick one or two from the list above. Once you confirm, we’ll move into the three-step revision process. We’ll start with the thesis (I’ll ask you to share the exact sentence you want as your thesis), then revise one body paragraph (topic sentence + paragraph content). 

Would you like to focus on grammar plus a stronger thesis and one paragraph, or only grammar across the whole essay?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T12:21:21.761Z

**You:** Only grammar across the whole essay

*Time:* 2025-11-30T12:22:12.086Z

**Assistant:** Great — thanks for choosing a focus. A quick note about scope so we work productively together:

- You asked to focus only on grammar across the whole essay. I can prioritize grammar, but the revision workflow I’ll follow here is the three-step process we agreed on: we will revise the thesis statement, then one body paragraph’s topic sentence, and then that paragraph’s supporting sentences. I’ll focus my feedback on grammar and sentence accuracy in those parts and point out general grammar patterns you can apply to the rest of the essay. Does that scope work for you?

If yes, two quick, simple questions so we can start Step 1:

1) Which sentence is your current thesis? (Please pick one of these or paste the sentence you intend as thesis.)
   - Option A: “So it is essential to think about how to solve the problem and whether it helps us boost efficiency in the distant future.”
   - Option B: “So the prospect of the shift into technology is hopeful in long term, people need to create and the bright future instead of being controlling by AI.”
   - Or paste another sentence you mean to use.

2) Which body paragraph would you like us to revise for Step 2 and Step 3? (I suggest the paragraph that begins “In the distant future, this technological shift truly changes employment rate in different countries.”)

Reply with your choices (thesis sentence and paragraph), and confirm that the limited-scope plan above is okay. Then we’ll start Step 1.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T12:22:27.292Z

**You:** Revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-30T12:36:44.211Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s work on the thesis.

Quick check: which sentence do you want to use as your current thesis?
- Option A: “So it is essential to think about how to solve the problem and whether it helps us boost efficiency in the distant future.”
- Option B: “So the prospect of the shift into technology is hopeful in long term, people need to create and the bright future instead of being controlling by AI.”
- Or paste another sentence you have in mind.

Feedback on those two quickly:
- Both are vague about the essay’s position. A thesis should clearly answer the prompt: do you think automation ultimately enhances or undermines global employment prospects in the long term?
- Both are grammatically weak (word order, articles, word choice) and don’t preview the main reasons or structure of the essay.
- Avoid hedging and vague phrases like “it is essential to think” or “hopeful in long term.” Be direct and specific.

Now your turn: please try rewriting a single, clear thesis sentence that
1) states your position (enhances or undermines), and
2) previews 2–3 main reasons or points you will develop.

Would you like to try writing that now? If you’re stuck, say “show examples” and I’ll give 2 model thesis sentences you can adapt.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T12:36:54.968Z

**You:** So the prospect of the shift into technology is hopeful in long term, people need to create and the bright future instead of being controlling by AI.” Revise thesis statement

*Time:* 2025-11-30T12:59:38.266Z

**Assistant:** Nice — thanks for sharing that sentence. Quick, encouraging feedback first:

- Strengths: You’re trying to express a hopeful position about technology and call for human action rather than passive acceptance. That’s a clear direction to take.
- Main problems to fix: it’s vague about the essay’s claim (does automation enhance or undermine?), awkward grammar (word order, articles), and it doesn’t preview reasons you will develop.

A helpful approach: pick a clear position (say “enhances” or “undermines”) and preview 2–3 reasons. Use confident phrasing and the phrase “in the long term” (not “in long term”).

Try revising now using this simple template (fill the blanks):

“Automation ultimately [enhances/undermines] global employment prospects in the long term because [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”

If you’d prefer a little more structure, use this frame to guide you (fill in the brackets):

“Although automation displaces many routine jobs, it ultimately [enhances/undermines] employment worldwide by [creating new industries and roles / increasing productivity that spurs demand / requiring new skills and policies to protect workers].”

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Paste your revision and I’ll give focused grammar and clarity feedback. If you want model examples instead, say “show examples.”

*Time:* 2025-11-30T12:59:52.912Z

**You:** So the prospect of the shift into technology is hopeful in long term, people need to create and the bright future instead of being controlling by AI. Can you help me to revise this thesis statement?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T13:22:35.993Z

**Assistant:** Nice work — you picked a clear direction (hopeful about technology) and asked for help. Quick feedback on your sentence: it was aiming for a positive stance but had grammar and clarity problems (word order, missing articles, and vague phrasing). I revised it to be direct, grammatically correct, and to preview reasons your essay can develop.

Here’s a suggested thesis you can use:
- Revised thesis: “Although automation displaces many routine jobs, it ultimately enhances global employment prospects in the long term by creating new industries, raising productivity that stimulates demand, and generating new, higher-skill roles that require human oversight.”

I’ve inserted that thesis into your full essay below (only the thesis sentence was changed). Read it and tell me if you’re happy with this version or want to tweak the wording or the reasons listed.

Are you satisfied with this thesis sentence? If yes, we’ll move to Step 2: pick the paragraph to revise (I suggest the paragraph that starts “In the distant future, this technological shift truly changes employment rate in different countries.”). If you’d like a different thesis version (shorter, stronger, or with different reasons), tell me which elements to change or say “show alternatives” and I’ll offer two quick options.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T13:22:58.415Z

**You:** Can you help me revise topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-11-30T13:30:28.000Z

**Assistant:** Great — I can help with topic sentences. Quick confirmation before we start:

- Are we working on the paragraph that begins, “In the distant future, this technological shift truly changes employment rate in different countries.”? (If you prefer a different paragraph, tell me which one.)
- Our thesis (the one we agreed on) is: “Although automation displaces many routine jobs, it ultimately enhances global employment prospects in the long term by creating new industries, raising productivity that stimulates demand, and generating new, higher-skill roles that require human oversight.” Which one of those three reasons should this paragraph develop? (Pick one: creating new industries, raising productivity/stimulating demand, or generating higher-skill roles that require human oversight.)

Next step: paste the current topic sentence for that paragraph (or confirm it’s the existing sentence: “In the distant future, this technological shift truly changes employment rate in different countries.”). Then try one short revision of that topic sentence that clearly links to the thesis reason you chose.

I’ll give brief feedback and—only if you want it—one or two model topic-sentence examples you can adapt. Would you like to try rewriting the topic sentence now?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T13:30:36.558Z

**You:** help me revise ‘ In the distant future, this technological shift truly changes employment rate in different countries

*Time:* 2025-11-30T13:34:54.187Z

**Assistant:** Good choice — this topic sentence needs to be clearer, grammatically correct, and linked to your thesis.

Quick feedback on the original:
- “In the distant future” is wordy; use “In the long term” or “Over time.”
- “truly changes” is vague and informal; use stronger verbs like “will change,” “will alter,” or “will affect.”
- “employment rate” → usually “employment rates” or simply “employment.”
- “in different countries” is too general; tie it to one of your thesis reasons (e.g., new industries, higher-skill roles, or productivity-led demand).

Before I give examples: which reason from your thesis do you want this paragraph to develop?
1) Creating new industries and roles
2) Raising productivity that stimulates demand
3) Generating new, higher-skill roles that require human oversight

Would you like to try rewriting the sentence now using one of the numbered focuses above? If you prefer, here are three model topic sentences (one for each focus) you can adapt:

- (1) Creating new industries: “In the long term, automation will spur the creation of entirely new industries, producing jobs that did not exist before and offsetting losses in routine work.”
- (2) Productivity → demand: “Over time, higher productivity from automation will lower costs and increase demand for goods and services, which in turn will create new employment opportunities.”
- (3) Higher-skill roles: “In the long run, automation will shift many tasks to machines but create more high-skill positions that require human oversight, boosting employment in technical and managerial fields.”

Pick one model to adapt or paste your own revision and I’ll give quick grammar and clarity feedback. Would you like to try?

*Time:* 2025-11-30T13:35:03.418Z

**You:** Can you help me revise this body paragraph? In the long term, this technological shift may enhance the global employment in some terms, as it creates new areas and new working jobs will born to support our global working backgrounds.

*Time:* 2025-11-30T13:36:32.844Z

**Assistant:** Nice — here’s a clear, focused revision of that body paragraph plus the full essay with the thesis we agreed on. I kept all other paragraphs unchanged so we stay within our agreed scope.

Automation is the major trend in nowadays which influences many aspects in daily life. Global employment shows both strengths and weaknesses under the background of this trend. AI truly brings convenience, while reduces the pressure of hand-made working tasks and boosts efficiency in different works. The shift of the technological brings some serious problems at the same time. Reducing employment in industry and global working prospect potentially affect our life from big news all over the world to each details in our home.

So it is essential to think about how to solve the problem and whether it helps us boost efficiency in the distant future.

Although automation displaces many routine jobs, it ultimately enhances global employment prospects in the long term by creating new industries, raising productivity that stimulates demand, and generating new, higher-skill roles that require human oversight.

In the long term, automation will spur the creation of new industries and roles that help offset job losses in routine sectors. As businesses adopt AI and robotics, demand grows for workers who design, program, maintain, and supervise these systems — positions such as data analysts, robotics technicians, and AI ethicists. New products and services enabled by automation also generate jobs across supply chains, from manufacturing specialized components to providing customer support. Although these roles often require different skills, investment in training and education can help workers transition into them, supporting overall employment growth.

In the long term, this technological shift may enhance the global employment in some terms, as it creates new areas and new working jobs will born to support our global working backgrounds.

So the prospect of the shift into technology is hopeful in long term, people need to create and the bright future instead of being controlling by AI.

What I changed in the paragraph (quick notes you can learn from)
- Topic sentence: made the connection explicit to the thesis reason (creation of new industries).
- Grammar fixes: subject-verb agreement (e.g., "automation will spur"), plural forms ("sectors"), and clearer articles and word choice ("new products and services" instead of "new areas").
- Unity and development: added specific examples of job types and a sentence showing how training can help workers move into those roles — this makes the paragraph support the thesis more clearly.

Would you like to:
- Tweak the wording so it sounds closer to your original voice, or
- Work next on the topic sentence for the other paragraph that also needs clearer linkage to the thesis, or
- Focus on grammar patterns to apply these fixes across the whole essay?

If you want a smaller change in that paragraph first, try rewriting one sentence and paste it here — I’ll give quick feedback.

**Assistant:** Great — I can help. Quick check so we stay focused: we’ve already updated the thesis and revised the paragraph about new industries. Which next change do you want me to help with now? Pick one:

1) Tweak the thesis wording to be shorter/stronger (I’ll only change the thesis).
2) Improve the paragraph we already revised (shorten sentences, simplify vocabulary, or change tone) — I’ll only edit that paragraph.
3) Move to a different paragraph (e.g., the paragraph about productivity or the conclusion). Note: that would switch our chosen paragraph; confirm if you want to change scope.

Choose 1, 2, or 3. Then either:
- Paste one sentence you want to revise (I’ll give targeted feedback and ask you to try a revision), or
- Say “show examples” and I’ll give 2–3 model sentences you can adapt.

Which do you choose?

**Assistant:** Thanks — good choice. Quick confirmation: I’ll revise the paragraph you quoted so it clearly links to the thesis and fixes the grammar and clarity problems. I’ll keep the thesis we agreed on and show the full essay with the revised paragraph included. Tell me if you want any wording changed afterward.

Automation is the major trend in nowadays which influences many aspects in daily life. Global employment shows both strengths and weaknesses under the background of this trend. AI truly brings convenience, while reduces the pressure of hand-made working tasks and boosts efficiency in different works. The shift of the technological brings some serious problems at the same time. Reducing employment in industry and global working prospect potentially affect our life from big news all over the world to each details in our home.

So it is essential to think about how to solve the problem and whether it helps us boost efficiency in the distant future.

Although automation displaces many routine jobs, it ultimately enhances global employment prospects in the long term by creating new industries, raising productivity that stimulates demand, and generating new, higher-skill roles that require human oversight.

In the long term, automation will spur the creation of new industries and roles that help offset job losses in routine sectors. As businesses adopt AI and robotics, demand grows for workers who design, program, maintain, and supervise these systems — positions such as data analysts, robotics technicians, and AI ethicists. New products and services enabled by automation also generate jobs across supply chains, from manufacturing specialized components to providing customer support. Although these roles often require different skills, investment in training and education can help workers transition into them, supporting overall employment growth.

In the long term, this technological shift may enhance global employment by creating new sectors and jobs to support technological ecosystems. As companies develop and deploy automation, they need workers in roles such as software developers, robotics technicians, data analysts, maintenance engineers, and customer support specialists. These positions arise across supply chains and services that accompany new technologies, generating employment opportunities in manufacturing, research and development, and service industries. With appropriate investment in training and education, displaced workers can transition into these new roles, helping to sustain overall employment.

So the prospect of the shift into technology is hopeful in long term, people need to create and the bright future instead of being controlling by AI.

Notes on what I changed in that paragraph (so you can apply the patterns elsewhere)
- Corrected grammar and word choice: changed “may enhance the global employment in some terms” to a direct statement “may enhance global employment by…”.
- Clarified meaning: replaced vague phrases (“new areas,” “new working jobs will born”) with concrete ideas (“new sectors and jobs,” “positions such as…”).
- Added examples and development so the paragraph supports the thesis (job types, where jobs appear, and the role of training).
- Kept sentences clear and connected to the thesis reason (creation of new industries/jobs).

Would you like to:
- Tweak any sentence here to better match your voice, or
- Work next on fixing the concluding sentences (they still need grammar and clarity), or
- Go over grammar patterns (articles, verb forms, plural/singular) that appear across the essay so you can revise the rest?

If you want a tiny edit now, paste one sentence you want changed and I’ll give a short suggestion.
