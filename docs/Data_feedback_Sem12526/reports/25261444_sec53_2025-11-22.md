            ## Contribution Analysis

            Based on the training assessment report and the chat history, here is a summary and guidance tailored to help the student move forward effectively:

---

### Summary of Current Situation
- The student’s original essay shows a clear partial agreement thesis and some relevant ideas but lacks polish and precise expression.
- In revision attempts, the student repeatedly used placeholders (e.g., “bla bla bla,” “let’s pretend...”) instead of submitting concrete revised text.
- The AI assistant consistently requested a complete, clear, and confident revised thesis statement before moving on to paragraph revisions, but the student avoided submitting an actual revision.
- This avoidance stalled meaningful collaborative revision and prevented targeted feedback and improvement.
- As a result, the revised draft quality dropped, showing undeveloped content, poor organization, and continued grammar/vocabulary issues.

---

### Key Recommendations for the Student

1. **Submit a Concrete Revised Thesis Statement**

   Replace placeholder texts with an actual, fully rewritten thesis that:
   - Clearly states your level of agreement (e.g., “I partly agree”).
   - Briefly previews the two main supporting points in order: (1) citizens influencing government through political pressure/voting, and (2) collective personal lifestyle choices influencing markets or social norms.
   - Acknowledges the greater scale and power of governments and corporations.
   - Uses confident, academic language without hedging or filler phrases.

   _Example thesis:_  
   “I partly agree that individual actions alone cannot solve climate change because while citizens can influence government policies through voting and advocacy, personal lifestyle changes collectively encourage companies to adopt sustainable practices; however, governments and corporations ultimately possess greater resources to drive large-scale change.”

2. **Follow the AI’s Stepwise Revision Plan**

   - First confirm your revised thesis so the assistant can focus feedback and align paragraph revisions with it.
   - Next, paste the current or revised topic sentence of the body paragraph you want to revise (start with paragraph #1 about political influence).
   - Revise the topic sentence to clearly link to the thesis by stating the claim and mechanism of influence.
   - Then provide the whole body paragraph for iterative revision of evidence, reasoning, grammar, and vocabulary.

3. **Engage Critically with AI Feedback**

   - When the assistant suggests rewrites or strategies, respond with acceptance, adaptations, or reasons for rejecting suggestions.
   - This shows active reflection and helps the assistant tailor guidance to your style and understanding.

4. **Replace Informal and Placeholder Language with Specific, Academic Content**

   - Avoid “bla bla bla,” “let’s pretend,” or vague instructions.
   - Instead, write complete sentences and paragraphs showing your revised ideas.
   - Check for grammar issues like subject-verb agreement, article use, verb forms, and replace informal phrases (“maybe,” “just want to”) with formal alternatives.

5. **Strengthen Supporting Examples**

   - Add more specific examples or evidence (e.g., a notable protest that led to policy change or a company shifting to green products due to consumer demand).
   - This will enrich your content and illustrate your points more convincingly.

---

### Instructor’s Next Steps

- Request the student to resubmit only the revised thesis statement first, no placeholders.
- Once the student submits a concrete thesis, work through paragraph #1 topic sentence revision, then paragraph content.
- Encourage the student to engage in the iterative process, producing concrete text and responding thoughtfully to feedback.
- Highlight that completing the mandatory thesis step is essential before moving forward to ensure a productive revision cycle.

---

By adhering to this structured approach and replacing placeholders with actual revised text, the student can unlock meaningful AI collaboration, enhance essay quality, and demonstrate the intended revision skills.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The essay takes a clear position (“I partly agree”) and presents two supporting ideas (influence on government; personal lifestyle choices). Examples are general but relevant: “if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy.” Some claims are underdeveloped and hedged (e.g., “But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little…”), which reduces depth.
- Organization: 21/25 - The essay has a basic introduction, two body paragraphs, and conclusion. Paragraph order is logical (policy influence then personal choices). Transitions and internal paragraph structure are weak in places and some sentences are repetitive or off-topic.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Reasonably clear everyday vocabulary and some topic terms (“clean energy,” “carbon emissions”), but limited range and informal phrasing reduce lexical precision.
- Grammar: 17/25 - Meaning is generally clear but there are frequent grammatical issues (subject-verb agreement: “the government maybe just listen”; missing articles and verb forms: “so nothing happen”; informal contractions). Sentences are often simple and sometimes ungrammatical, affecting polish.
- **Original Essay Total: 77/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - The revised essay contains placeholders rather than substantive revisions (e.g., “(revised thesis statement here)”, “bla bla bla …”). Because the student did not submit an actual revised thesis or substantive paragraph edits, content is not meaningfully improved and, in places, is degraded.
- Organization: 16/25 - The overall structure from the original draft is retained, but placeholders interrupt flow and indicate incomplete work. The essay's intended structure is visible but not executed.
- Vocabulary: 14/25 - Use of “bla bla bla …” and instructions inserted in-line reduces vocabulary quality and formality. Where original language remains, vocabulary is unchanged and still limited.
- Grammar: 14/25 - Original grammatical problems persist where content remains. In addition, inserted placeholder text and informal notes further lower the score because they break coherence and register.
- **Revised Essay Total: 61/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -16 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None substantive — the student did not provide a true revised thesis, topic sentence, or fully revised paragraph. The structural intent is present but not executed.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Revise and replace the placeholder thesis with a concise, two-point thesis that previews the essay.
  - Produce a clear, assertive topic sentence for paragraph 1 that links directly to the revised thesis.
  - Complete a full revision of body paragraph 1 (add evidence, tighten reasoning, fix grammar and cohesion).
  - Address grammatical errors and improve vocabulary precision and formality.

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 12** (12 messages in the provided chat history; assistant and user alternating).
- **Conversation Quality:** The AI assistant provided clear, scaffolded guidance (templates, checklists, and stepwise instructions) focused on revising the thesis and topic sentences. The student repeatedly avoided supplying revised text, using phrases such as “let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement” and “bla bla bla …,” which prevented substantive revision. Example user messages: “let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on” and “ok let’s revise the rest of the body paragraph #1 bla bla bla”.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Developing. The chat shows multiple turns (12 messages) and focused prompts from the assistant. However, the depth of substantive revision was limited because the student did not provide actual revised content; there were fewer than the extensive exchanges (15+) expected for the highest band and limited multi-level questioning from the student.
  - Evidence: The assistant repeatedly requested a revised thesis and topic sentence template and the student repeatedly replied with placeholders instead of actual text (e.g., “let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement”).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 1/5 - Limited. The student did not critically evaluate or accept/reject suggestions with reasons. Instead of posting revisions or engaging with suggested changes, the student avoided providing content for review.
  - Evidence: Assistant gave checklists and templates; student responses avoided implementing or discussing them (e.g., “bla bla bla …”).
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 - Limited. There is no evidence of iterative revision cycles in the chat. The assistant insisted on completing the thesis revision before paragraph work; the student repeatedly declined to provide the revised thesis and therefore no meaningful revision cycle occurred.
  - Evidence: Multiple assistant prompts emphasizing the mandatory thesis step (“I can’t move on to paragraph work until you confirm the thesis”), and user refusal to submit it.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 5/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Willingness to engage: The student participated in multiple chat turns and signaled an intent to revise specific parts (e.g., “ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1”), showing some openness to the process.
- The original draft contained a clear argumentative stance and basic paragraph structure, which provide a workable starting point.
- The student followed the assistant into an organized revision workflow (the assistant’s scaffolds were clear and appropriate).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Provide concrete revisions rather than placeholders — replace “bla bla bla” with actual revised thesis and paragraph text so the assistant can give targeted feedback.
- Complete the mandatory thesis revision step before asking to revise paragraphs; follow the assistant’s stepwise plan.
- Engage critically with AI suggestions: evaluate proposed phrasings and explain acceptance/rejection to show reflective revision.
- Address grammatical and vocabulary weaknesses (see examples below) and supply revised sentences for feedback.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student did not supply the revised thesis or topic sentence for the assistant to work from; instead used placeholders, which limited useful assistance.
  - Evidence: Repeated student replies: “let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement” and “bla bla bla …”.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The student did not follow the assistant's required sequence (thesis first), undermining the iterative plan.
  - Evidence: The assistant repeatedly stated the thesis revision is mandatory before paragraph work; the student persisted in skipping it.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - The student did not critique or reflect on AI recommendations; no accept/reject rationale was provided.
  - Evidence: No messages where the student discusses the assistant’s specific wording suggestions or gives reasons for choices.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The student did not produce revised text after receiving guidance, so independent revision steps are not demonstrated.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Replace placeholders with concrete revisions: submit a concise revised thesis that clearly states “partly agree” and previews the two supporting points (policy influence; collective personal choices), then ask for feedback.
2. Follow the assistant’s required order: confirm the thesis first, then post the topic sentence to revise, then paste the full paragraph for iterative edits. This will enable targeted, stepwise improvement.
3. Show critical engagement: when the AI suggests rewrites, accept, adapt, or reject them and briefly explain why. This will demonstrate critical thinking and allow richer collaboration.
4. Address grammar and vocabulary systematically: run a self-edit pass (or ask the assistant) for common errors (articles, agreement, verb forms), and replace informal language (“bla bla bla,” “maybe”) with precise academic phrasing.
5. Provide evidence and more specific examples in body paragraphs (e.g., name a case where public pressure changed policy; cite a corporate response to consumer demand) to strengthen content.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student has not completed the three required revision tasks: revised thesis statement, revised topic sentence, and revised body paragraph. The submission contains placeholder text rather than actual revisions; please request a resubmission with concrete revised content.
- The AI assistant provided clear scaffolding and repeated prompts to complete the mandatory thesis step; the student’s avoidance of this step prevented meaningful revision and assessment of AI-assisted writing.
- Recommend instructing the student to reattempt the revision cycle by first posting a concrete revised thesis, then the topic sentence to revise, then the paragraph — in that order — to demonstrate iterative improvement and AI collaboration skills.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. bla bla bla … ... (revised thesis statement here)

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-11-22T06:42:42.449Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T06:47:38.882Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — I see your current thesis at the end: "I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play."

Quick feedback on clarity, strength, and focus:
- Strengths: It directly answers the question (partial agreement) and gives two reasons (influence on government; personal lifestyle choices). That’s a good start.
- How to improve:
  - Be more specific and concise. Remove weak phrases like "which is very important," "at the same time," and "I also think" — they add clutter and weaken authority.
  - Preview the essay structure clearly: name the two main points you will discuss (e.g., political influence and consumer/behavioural influence) and briefly indicate why governments/corporations still matter (scale, resources, policy power).
  - Use confident, precise language (avoid “maybe,” “I think,” or unnecessary hedging).
  - Consider showing the extent of your agreement more clearly (e.g., "to some extent" is okay, but follow with exactly why).

What to include in your revised thesis (checklist):
- State your position clearly (extent of agreement).
- Preview the two main supporting points in order (so readers know essay structure).
- Acknowledge briefly that governments/corporations have greater capacity or responsibility (this explains the “partly”).
- Use confident wording and delete hedging.

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now using those points? Send your new version and I’ll give focused feedback until you’re happy.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T06:47:52.090Z

**You:** let's pretend we have revised the thesis statement and move on
bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-11-22T06:51:51.943Z

**Assistant:** Great — before we move on, I need one small confirmation.

Step 1 — Quick thesis check
- Could you paste the revised thesis statement you “pretend” you made (or simply confirm that your final thesis:
  1) clearly says you partly agree,
  2) names the two main reasons (how citizens influence government; how personal choices matter),
  3) briefly acknowledges that governments/corporations have greater capacity)?
- I can’t continue to paragraph work until you confirm the thesis is the version we’ll use.

Step 2 — Choose a paragraph
- Which body paragraph would you like to work on: paragraph 2 (influence on government) or paragraph 3 (personal green habits)? Paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence here.

Hints for revising the topic sentence (do not copy — try to use these as a guide):
- Make the connection to the thesis explicit: state the claim in a way that shows it supports your overall “partly agree” stance.
- Use a clear structure: CLAIM + HOW/MECHANISM + (optional) EFFECT. Example structure template: “[Claim about individuals’ power] + because/through [specific mechanism] + resulting in [policy or corporate change].”
- Avoid hedging words like “maybe,” “I think,” or vague phrases like “very important.” Use confident verbs (e.g., “can persuade,” “influence,” “pressure”).
- Keep it concise and preview what the paragraph will explain.

Would you like to try revising the topic sentence now? Paste your current topic sentence or your new attempt and I’ll give focused feedback to strengthen the link to the thesis.

*Time:* 2025-11-22T06:52:12.192Z

**You:** let’s pretend we have revised the topic sentences and move on 
bla bla bla …

*Time:* 2025-11-22T06:59:11.900Z

**Assistant:** Nice work so far — your original thesis already answers the question and previews two reasons, which is a strong start. Before we continue to paragraph work, we need a clear, confident revised thesis you’re happy with.

Step 1 — Please rewrite the thesis now
- Quick reminders for revision:
  - Be concise and confident (no “I think,” “maybe,” or “very important”).
  - State the extent of your agreement clearly (e.g., “partly agree” / “to some extent”).
  - Preview the two main supporting points in order (how citizens influence policy; how personal choices affect markets/norms).
  - Briefly acknowledge why governments/corporations still matter (scale/resources/policy power).
- Use this short structure (not a full sentence): 
  - [Position: partly agree] + because [reason 1: citizens can influence government through voting/pressure] and [reason 2: collective personal choices influence markets/norms], while acknowledging [counterpoint: governments/corporations have greater scale and policy power].

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Paste your new version and I’ll give focused feedback. I won’t move on to paragraph work until you confirm you’re satisfied with this thesis.

Step 2 — Choose a paragraph to revise (after thesis confirmed)
- Which body paragraph do you want to work on: paragraph 2 (influence on government) or paragraph 3 (personal green habits)?
- Paste that paragraph’s current topic sentence here.

Helpful topic-sentence guide (use as a frame, not a full sentence from me):
- [Claim about individuals’ power] + because/through [specific mechanism: voting, protesting, consumer choice] + resulting in [policy or market change].

When you paste your revised thesis and the topic sentence you want to work on, I’ll give targeted feedback to help you rewrite the topic sentence and then guide you to revise the rest of that paragraph. Would you like to try it now?

*Time:* 2025-11-22T06:59:35.181Z

**You:** ok let's revise the rest of the body paragraph #1

*Time:* 2025-11-22T07:01:01.347Z

**Assistant:** Great — I can help with paragraph #1, but first we must complete Step 1: revise the thesis (this is mandatory). Please paste the revised thesis you want us to use. I can’t move on to the paragraph until you confirm the thesis.

Quick, focused feedback on your original thesis (the one you wrote earlier):
- Strengths: it answers the question (partial agreement) and previews two reasons (influencing government; personal lifestyle choices).
- Improvements needed: make it more concise and confident, remove hedging language (e.g., “I think,” “which is very important,” “at the same time”), and briefly acknowledge why governments/corporations still matter (scale/policy power).

Use this short template to rewrite (don’t copy it word-for-word — make your own sentence):
- [Position: partly agree] + because [reason 1: citizens can influence government through voting/pressure] and [reason 2: collective personal choices can change markets/norms], while acknowledging [counterpoint: governments/corporations have greater scale and policy power].

Checklist before you paste:
- Does it clearly state “partly agree” (or similar)?
- Does it preview the two main points in order?
- Does it briefly acknowledge the greater capacity of governments/corporations?
- Is the language confident and concise?

Once you paste your revised thesis and confirm you’re happy with it, paste the topic sentence for the paragraph you want to work on (I assume you mean the paragraph about influencing government — please confirm). Then we’ll revise that topic sentence to connect tightly to the thesis and move on to the rest of the paragraph. 

Ready to paste your revised thesis?

*Time:* 2025-11-22T07:01:15.169Z

**You:** ok let’s revise the rest of the body paragraph #1

bla bla bla

*Time:* 2025-11-22T07:01:54.843Z

**Assistant:** Great — I’m ready to revise paragraph #1 with you. First, we must finish Step 1 (thesis revision) — that’s mandatory before we move on.

1) Please paste the revised thesis statement you want us to use (or rewrite it now). Quick checklist to follow:
- Clearly say you “partly agree” (or equivalent).
- Preview the two main supporting points in order (citizens influencing government; collective personal choices affecting markets/norms).
- Briefly acknowledge why governments/corporations still matter (scale/policy/resources).
- Use confident, concise language (no “I think,” “maybe,” or extra hedging).

2) Once you paste the revised thesis and confirm you’re happy with it, paste the current topic sentence for body paragraph #1 (the paragraph about influencing government). If you want, you can simply confirm that the current topic sentence is: “The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians.”

Hints for revising the topic sentence (use as a frame — please try to rewrite it yourself):
- Structure: Claim + how/through what mechanism + (optional) expected effect.
- Template example (not a full sentence): [Individuals can pressure policymakers] + through [voting, protests, petitions, public opinion] + resulting in [stronger environmental laws or investment in clean energy].

Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now? Paste it, and then we’ll tighten the topic sentence for paragraph #1.
