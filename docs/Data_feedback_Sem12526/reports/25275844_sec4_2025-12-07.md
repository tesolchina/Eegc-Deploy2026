            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing the full training assessment report and chat history. Here is a clear summary and actionable advice based on the provided information.

---

### Summary of Key Points

**1. Thesis Revision and Alignment**  
- You wrote a clearer argumentative thesis in the revised essay about automation’s impact on employment. This is an improvement compared to the original climate-change thesis.  
- However, you shifted the topic entirely from climate change (original) to automation (revised), which does not fulfill the assignment to revise the original essay directly.  
- Your thesis drafts showed progress: removing “I think,” clarifying the subject (automation), and aiming to preview reasons.

**2. Topic Sentence and Paragraph Revision**  
- You chose to revise paragraph 3 (long-term benefits of automation), which fits your thesis focus.  
- The topic sentences need stronger linkage to your thesis and more precise phrasing to improve clarity and coherence.

**3. Grammar and Vocabulary**  
- Frequent grammar errors remain in the revised draft, including verb forms, articles, pluralization, word choice, and awkward phrasing.  
- Fixing these will enhance readability and academic tone.

**4. Human-AI Interaction**  
- You engaged with the AI’s guidance but skipped some iterative steps (e.g., insisted on skipping step 1 and 2 at one point).  
- Limited critical evaluation of AI suggestions was documented—explaining why you accept or reject feedback will improve collaboration quality.

---

### Recommendations for Your Next Steps

**A. Align Revision Topic with Assignment**  
- Confirm with your instructor if the task requires revising the original essay on climate change. If yes, focus your rewriting there instead of switching topics.  
- If automation is an accepted alternative topic, clarify that and proceed accordingly.

**B. Strengthen and Finalize Your Thesis**  
- Use a clear template, for example:  
  *“Although automation displaces some jobs initially, it will strengthen global employment prospects in the long term by creating new kinds of work, raising productivity, and encouraging upskilling.”*  
- Preview your main argument points clearly and confidently (avoid “I believe,” “maybe”).

**C. Improve Topic Sentences**  
- Make each paragraph’s topic sentence directly state the main idea connected to the thesis.  
- Example for paragraph 3:  
  *“Automation creates safer and more challenging jobs, which will strengthen employment prospects in the long term.”*

**D. Systematic Grammar Review**  
- Use grammar checking tools or work with your AI assistant to correct specific sentence-level errors. Focus on:  
  - Subject-verb agreement  
  - Verb tenses and forms  
  - Article usage (a, an, the)  
  - Plural vs. singular forms  
  - Common collocation errors (e.g., “influence” not “influent”)  

**E. Provide Examples and Evidence**  
- Add specific industries, technologies, or data to support your claims. For example, mention “AI maintenance,” “green technology,” or “reskilling programs.”  
- This strengthens content and persuasiveness.

**F. Follow Stepwise Revision Processes and Document Choices**  
- Work with your AI assistant step-by-step as guided.  
- When accepting or rejecting suggestions, write a short note explaining your decision. This shows critical thinking and helps improve revision quality.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 18/25 - Presents a clear position about individual vs. government action on climate change and gives relevant reasons (influence government; personal green habits). Development is basic and examples are general.
- Organization: 18/25 - Logical structure with intro, two body paragraphs, conclusion. Paragraphs are somewhat repetitive and transitions are weak.
- Vocabulary: 17/25 - Generally appropriate vocabulary but limited range and some imprecise word choices (e.g., "maybe just listen a little").
- Grammar: 16/25 - Frequent sentence-level errors (articles, verb forms, agreement, punctuation) that sometimes impede flow.
- **Original Essay Total: 69/100**

Evidence: thesis and conclusion are explicit (“I partly agree…” / “everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together”), but sentences like “But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action” show grammar and clarity problems.

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 17/25 - A clearer argumentative thesis about automation is present: “Automation, despite displacing some jobs in the short term, will ultimately enhance global employment prospects by creating new types of work and transforming industries for higher productivity.” The essay outlines short-term harms and long-term benefits but provides limited concrete evidence or varied examples.
- Organization: 17/25 - The essay follows a clear short-term vs long-term structure. However, paragraph development is uneven and some ideas repeat without deeper elaboration.
- Vocabulary: 14/25 - Many collocation and word-choice errors (e.g., “boosting efficiency,” “pointview,” “influet”), and some awkward phrasing reduce clarity.
- Grammar: 13/25 - Numerous grammatical errors (verb forms, articles, pluralization, sentence fragments) significantly affect readability (e.g., “more and more industries are being transform,” “jobs exactly will indeed,” “incrreased boosting efficiency reduce”).
- **Revised Essay Total: 61/100**

Evidence: The revised thesis sentence quoted above is a clear improvement in argumentative focus. However, sentences across the essay (e.g., “Consequently, society has two sides of arguments on whether this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term.”) show persistent grammar and register problems.

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: -8 points**
  (Original 69 → Revised 61; note: the revised essay addresses a different topic from the original, which affects a direct improvement comparison.)
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Stronger, more explicit thesis in the revised essay that previews reasons: “Automation, despite displacing some jobs in the short term, will ultimately enhance global employment prospects by creating new types of work and transforming industries for higher productivity.”
  - Clearer argumentative structure in the revised draft (explicit short-term harm vs long-term benefits).
  - More focused claim and roadmap in the opening paragraph of the revised essay.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Topic alignment: the original essay discusses climate change; the revised essay addresses automation — this is a fundamental mismatch and indicates the student did not perform a direct revision of the original draft.
  - Grammar and sentence-level accuracy: persistent errors throughout the revised essay need systematic correction.
  - Evidence and examples: both drafts would benefit from specific, concrete examples or data (e.g., named industries, statistics, historical examples of technological transitions).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges:** 15 messages (mix of assistant guidance and student responses)
- **Conversation Quality:** The interaction shows substantial guidance from the assistant (thesis templates, sentence frames, revision steps). The student engaged by pasting drafts and a thesis, selected paragraph 3 for revision, but at one point asked to “skip the step1&2” and did not fully follow the iterative process requested by the assistant. The chat contains useful model prompts and templates but limited demonstration of iterative revisions performed collaboratively in the chat window.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 4/5 - The chat contains multiple substantive back-and-forths (detailed templates and stepwise guidance). The exchange count (≈15) meets the “robust exchanges” level, but the student did not fully complete the requested stepwise iterations in-chat.
  - Evidence: assistant provided detailed thesis templates and frames; student posted thesis and selected paragraph 3.
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 3/5 - The student accepted much of the assistant’s guidance (used suggested structures), but there is limited evidence of explicit, reasoned evaluation of specific AI suggestions (the student did not document accepting/rejecting suggestions with justification).
  - Evidence: student pasted a thesis (“I strongly believe…”) after the assistant’s guidance but did not explain why they chose that form or incorporate all recommended changes; later asked to skip steps.
- **Refining Process**: 3/5 - Some iteration is present (student posted a thesis and selected a paragraph), but the student did not complete the full iterative cycles requested by the assistant and at times resisted the stepwise process (“skip the step1&2”).
  - Evidence: the assistant repeatedly requested a thesis revision and stepwise editing; the student provided some text but avoided further in-chat iterations.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 10/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear argumentative stance in both drafts (original: balanced view on citizens’ role in climate change; revised: automation will enhance employment long-term). Evidence: explicit thesis sentences in both essays.
- Student engaged with AI prompts and used provided templates (the revised essay contains a thesis that follows the assistant’s template).
- Logical essay structure in the revised draft (short-term harms vs long-term benefits).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Topic management and task alignment: ensure revisions are applied to the correct original draft/topic (original climate-change essay was not revised into the automation essay).
- Grammar and sentence-level accuracy: systematic review needed (verb forms, articles, agreement, collocations).
- Depth of evidence and development: add concrete examples, data, or citations to support claims; develop topic sentences into fully supported paragraphs.
- Collaborative process: follow iterative steps in-chat to show critical evaluation of AI suggestions and document decisions.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Needs Improvement - The student provided a draft and topic, but the assistant repeatedly requested the thesis and stepwise revisions; the student sometimes refused to follow steps. Evidence: assistant asked for the thesis to revise; student later said “skip the step1&2.”
- **Strategic Planning**: Good - The student selected a specific paragraph (Para.3) to work on, indicating some strategic focus.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Developing - Limited documented evaluation or selective acceptance/rejection of AI suggestions; the student accepted templates but did not annotate choices.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The revised essay shows some adoption of suggested thesis framing, but many grammar and phrasing errors persist; the student did not complete iterative in-chat revisions that would demonstrate independent, critical edits with AI support.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Align revisions to the original assignment: always confirm the target draft and keep consistent topic focus when revising.
2. Prioritize sentence-level accuracy: run a focused grammar pass (subject-verb agreement, verb forms, articles, pluralization) and use the AI to produce corrected versions of problematic sentences.
3. Document revision choices in-chat: when accepting or rejecting AI suggestions, write a short rationale (e.g., “I accept this thesis because…”, “I prefer X wording because…”) to show critical engagement and to gain higher marks on collaboration rubrics.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student produced a clearer thesis in the revised essay, but it appears they changed topic rather than revising the original climate-change draft. Please confirm whether the assignment required revising the original essay or producing a new essay on automation.
- The student benefits from stepwise scaffolding (templates and frames) but did not complete the iterative cycle requested by the assistant. Encourage the student to follow the AI’s step sequence or to explain why they deviate.
- Strong focus on grammar instruction is recommended (targeted exercises or proofreading support) before expecting higher-level improvements in content and vocabulary.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
With the development of automation, more and more industries are being transform and the jobs are potentially being reduce. Consequently, society has two sides of arguments on whether this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects. Automation, despite displacing some jobs in the short term, will ultimately enhance global employment prospects by creating new types of work and transforming industries for higher productivity.

However, many people agree the opposing pointview. From their perspective, the boosting efficiency potentially reduces the opportunities of work, which seriously influent the employee's quality of life. The employees are the foundation of global employment prospects. Without them, the prospects would decline. Therefore, the technological shift would ultimately undermine them. I understand this logic, but it is only suitable for the short term.

It is generally acknowledged that the advancing technology will replace some routine work, like washing dishes, sweeping streets and putting items on the fixed place. In the short term, these jobs exactly will indeed. Nevertheless, the technology brings not only the replacement of jobs, but also more opportunities to new, boosting jobs. With the automation of transforming industries, more and more simple or dangerous jobs will be replaced by the technology, leaving the safer and more challenging job to us. Although automation will displace some jobs initially, it will strengthen global employment prospects in the long term by creating new types of work and raising overall productivity.

In summary, while incrreased boosting efficiency reduce some jobs in the short terrm, it also creates the new job in the long term. This will ultimately enhance the global employment prospects.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T22:27:46.988Z

**You:** Topic: Automation is transforming industries, potentially reducing jobs while boosting efficiency. Does this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects in the long term?

Original draft:
With the development of automation, more and more industries transform and the jobs reduce potentially. So the social have two sides of arguments: this technological shift ultimately enhance or undermine global employment prospects. In my opinion, it will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.

However, most of people agree the against pointview. From their perspective, the boosting efficiency potentially reduce the opportunities of work, which seriously influent the employee's quality of life. The employee is the foundation of global employment prospects. Without the employee, the global employment prospects must declines. So the technological shift will ultimately undermine the prospects. I agree their logical chain. However, the logical chain is only suitable for the short term.

It is generally acknowledged that the boosting technology will replace some simple work, like washing the bowls, sweeping the street and putting something on the fixed place. In the short term, these jobs exactly will reduce. Nevertheless, the technology not only bring the replacement of jobs, but also bring more opportunities to new boosting jobs. With the automation of transforming industries, more and more simple or dangerous job will be replaced by the technology, leaving the safe and challenged job to us.  I strongly believed that this situation will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.

In summary, the boosting efficiency not only reduce the job, but also enhance the new job in the long term. That will enhance the global employment prospects.

**Assistant:** Step 1 — Thesis statement revision

Thanks — I see your current thesis: “In my opinion, it will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.”

Feedback on clarity, strength, and focus
- Strengths: It states your position clearly (you think automation will enhance employment in the long term).
- Problems to fix:
  - Avoid “In my opinion” — it weakens the academic tone. State the claim directly.
  - Be specific about the subject: say “automation” or “this technological shift” rather than “it.”
  - “Ultimately” and “in the long term” are repetitive; keep one clear time marker.
  - The thesis does not preview the main reasons/evidence you will use. A strong thesis should signal the main points you will argue (for example: job creation in new sectors, higher productivity that spurs growth, and skills/upskilling opportunities).
  - Use confident, precise language and a strong verb (e.g., “will enhance” or “will have a net positive effect on”).

Quick thesis template you can use (fill in the brackets)
- “Automation will [strong verb + result] global employment prospects in the long term by [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using that template? Paste your revised version here, and we’ll check it together. I’ll wait for your revision and confirmation that you’re happy with it before we move to Step 2.

Step 2 — Choose a body paragraph
Which paragraph would you like to work on first?
- Paragraph 2: the counter-argument about short-term job losses and quality-of-life impacts, or
- Paragraph 3: your paragraph arguing that automation will create new, safer, and more challenging jobs (long-term benefits).

Tell me which paragraph you choose and paste its current topic sentence. I’ll give targeted feedback on how well that topic sentence connects to your revised thesis and suggest a short sentence frame to strengthen the link. (Remember: you’ll revise the topic sentence yourself first.)

*Time:* 2025-12-06T22:57:39.417Z

**You:** Giving me some suggestions to revise thesis statement.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T23:18:42.702Z

**Assistant:** Great — I can help. First, please paste the exact thesis you want to revise (the one from your current draft). Meanwhile, here are focused suggestions and usable sentence frames (not full rewritten sentences) to guide you.

Quick checklist for a strong thesis (use this to judge your revision)
- Directly answers the question (clear position on whether automation helps or harms employment).
- Previews 2–3 main reasons you will use in the essay.
- Uses confident, precise language (no “I think,” “maybe,” or weak hedges).
- Keeps time reference clear (choose “in the long term” or “short term,” not both).

Helpful verbs and phrases you can use to start your thesis (pick one)
- “Automation will…”
- “This technological shift will…”
- “Widespread automation is likely to…”
- “Although automation displaces some jobs initially, it will ultimately…”

Possible result phrases to complete your main claim (choose one)
- “…strengthen global employment prospects”
- “…have a net positive effect on employment”
- “…expand job opportunities in the long term”
- “…transform the labour market for the better”

Reason fragments you can combine in your thesis (choose 2–3 and insert after “by” or “because”)
- “creating new types of work in emerging sectors (for example, AI maintenance, robotics, and green technologies)”
- “raising productivity and economic growth that generate demand for new jobs”
- “shifting employment from routine manual tasks to higher-skilled, safer, and more creative roles”
- “driving investment in reskilling and upskilling programmes”
- “encouraging industries to develop new services and products that require more human labour”

Two short template frames (fill the blanks; do not write “I think”)
- Template A: “Automation will [strong verb phrase] global employment prospects in the long term by [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”
- Template B (nuanced): “Although automation will displace some jobs in the short term, it will [strong verb phrase] employment overall by [reason 1] and [reason 2].”

Language tips
- Prefer a single clear time-frame: “in the long term” or “in the short term.”
- Use active verbs: will strengthen / will expand / will create / will have a net positive effect.
- Avoid vague terms like “boosting efficiency” without explaining how that links to jobs.

Would you like to try one revision now using a template? Paste your new thesis here. Once you confirm you’re happy with it, we’ll move to Step 2 — choose which paragraph you want to revise (paragraph 2: counter-argument on short-term harm; or paragraph 3: long-term benefits).

*Time:* 2025-12-06T23:18:59.099Z

**You:** Revise topic sentences

*Time:* 2025-12-06T23:40:36.220Z

**Assistant:** Step 1 — Thesis statement revision

Please paste the exact thesis sentence you want to revise (from your current final draft). I’ll give quick, focused feedback on clarity, strength, and whether it previews your main points.

Before you paste, here are a few brief, important points to check in your revision:
- Remove phrases like “In my opinion.” State the claim directly and confidently.
- Name the subject clearly: use “automation” or “this technological shift.”
- Keep one clear time-frame: choose “in the long term” (or “short term”), but avoid repeating both.
- Preview 2–3 main reasons you will discuss (e.g., new job types, productivity-driven growth, reskilling/upskilling).
- Use a strong verb: “will strengthen / will expand / will have a net positive effect on.”

Two short frames you can use (fill the blanks — don’t write “I think”):
- Template A: “Automation will [strong verb phrase] global employment prospects in the long term by [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”
- Template B (nuanced): “Although automation will displace some jobs initially, it will [strong verb phrase] employment overall by [reason 1] and [reason 2].”

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using one of these frames? Paste your revised thesis here. I’ll give one quick revision suggestion and then we’ll confirm it before moving to Step 2.

Step 2 — Choose a body paragraph

Which paragraph would you like to work on?
- Paragraph 2 (counter-argument about short-term job losses and quality-of-life impacts), or
- Paragraph 3 (argument that automation creates new, safer, and more challenging jobs in the long term).

After you tell me which paragraph, paste its current topic sentence. I’ll comment on how well it links to your revised thesis and give a short sentence frame to strengthen that connection. Please revise the topic sentence yourself and paste the new version before we move to Step 3. Would you like to choose now?

*Time:* 2025-12-06T23:40:51.549Z

**You:** Para.3

*Time:* 2025-12-06T23:42:59.452Z

**Assistant:** Great — you’ve chosen paragraph 3. First we must complete Step 1 (thesis). Please paste the exact thesis sentence you want to revise (copy it from your final draft). I’ll give quick, focused feedback and a short template to help you rewrite it.

Quick checklist I’ll use to review your thesis:
- Directly answers the question (clear stance on automation’s effect on employment).
- Previews 2–3 main reasons you will discuss.
- Uses confident, precise language (no “I think,” no weak hedges).
- Uses one clear time-frame (e.g., “in the long term”).
- Strong verb (will strengthen / will expand / will have a net positive effect).

Two short templates you can use (fill the blanks; don’t add “I think”):
- Template A: “Automation will [strong verb phrase] global employment prospects in the long term by [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”
- Template B: “Although automation will displace some jobs initially, it will [strong verb phrase] employment overall by [reason 1] and [reason 2].”

Paste your current thesis now, or try a rewrite using one of these templates. Confirm you’re happy with the revised thesis before we move to Step 2 (topic sentence for paragraph 3).

*Time:* 2025-12-06T23:43:11.835Z

**You:** I strongly believe that this trend will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.

*Time:* 2025-12-06T23:46:41.683Z

**Assistant:** Good — thanks for pasting your thesis: “I strongly believe that this trend will ultimately enhance global employment prospects in the long term.”

Quick feedback on clarity, strength, and focus
- Strengths: The sentence clearly takes a positive position on the effect of automation.
- Areas to improve:
  - Remove personal phrasing (“I strongly believe”) to keep an academic tone.
  - Avoid redundancy (“ultimately” + “in the long term” say the same thing).
  - Replace vague reference (“this trend”) with the clear subject (“automation” or “this technological shift”).
  - Preview your main reasons: the thesis should signal 2–3 reasons you will develop in the essay (e.g., job creation in new sectors, productivity-driven growth, reskilling/upskilling).
  - Use a stronger, direct verb phrase (e.g., “will strengthen,” “will expand,” “will have a net positive effect on”).

Helpful templates (fill the blanks — do not include “I”)
- Template A: “Automation will [strong verb phrase] global employment prospects in the long term by [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”
- Template B (nuanced): “Although automation will displace some jobs initially, it will [strong verb phrase] employment overall by [reason 1] and [reason 2].”

Useful reason phrases you can insert (pick 2–3)
- “creating new types of work in emerging sectors (for example, AI maintenance or green technologies)”
- “raising productivity and economic growth that generate demand for new jobs”
- “shifting work from routine tasks to safer, higher-skilled, and more creative roles”
- “driving investment in reskilling and upskilling programmes”

Language tips to keep in mind
- Use one clear time-frame: “in the long term.”
- Use active confident verbs: will strengthen / will expand / will create / will have a net positive effect.
- Keep it specific and preview the structure of your essay.

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using one of the templates above? Paste your revised thesis here. I’ll give one quick, focused suggestion and we’ll confirm you’re happy with it before moving on to Step 2.

**You:** However, many people agree the opposing pointview. From their perspective, the boosting efficiency potentially reduces the opportunities of work, which seriously influent the employee's quality of life. The employees are the foundation of global employment prospects. Without them, the prospects would decline. Therefore, the technological shift would ultimately undermine them. I understand this logic, but it is only suitable for the short term.

**Assistant:** Great — let’s start with Step 1.

Please paste the exact thesis sentence you want to revise (copy it from your current draft). I’ll give short, focused feedback on clarity, strength, and whether it previews the main points. 

Meanwhile, a few quick points to keep in mind when you paste your thesis:
- Drop “I think / In my opinion” — state the claim directly.
- Name the subject clearly (use “automation” or “this technological shift”).
- Use one time frame: pick “in the long term” (do not repeat “ultimately” and “in the long term”).
- Preview 2–3 main reasons you will develop (e.g., new job types, productivity-driven growth, reskilling/upskilling).
- Use a strong verb: will strengthen / will expand / will have a net positive effect.

Two short templates you can use to rewrite (fill the blanks — do not include “I”):
- Template A: “Automation will [strong verb phrase] global employment prospects in the long term by [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”
- Template B: “Although automation will displace some jobs initially, it will [strong verb phrase] employment overall by [reason 1] and [reason 2].”

Pick a template or write your own and paste it here. I’ll give one quick suggestion and we’ll confirm you’re happy before moving to Step 2. Would you like to try rewriting the thesis now?

**You:** skip the step1&2

**Assistant:** I can’t skip Step 1 — we need to revise the thesis first. Could you confirm or paste your current thesis sentence here? (I see one in your draft that begins with “Automation, despite displacing some jobs in the short term…” — please paste that exact sentence if that’s the version you want to revise.)

Quick, focused feedback on that thesis (if that is the sentence you pasted)
- Strengths: It takes a clear position (automation will enhance employment long-term) and signals reasons (creating new work; transforming industries/productivity).
- Things to improve:
  - Be slightly more specific: “new types of work” and “transforming industries for higher productivity” are useful, but naming one or two examples (e.g., AI maintenance, green tech, reskilling) would make the preview stronger.
  - Keep language concise and confident. “Despite… in the short term” is fine, but avoid repeating time-markers unnecessarily (choose one clear way to indicate time-frame).
  - Make the reasons parallel in structure so the thesis reads clearly as a roadmap (three short, parallel phrases is easy to follow).

Useful short templates you can use (fill the blanks; do not include “I think”)
- Template A: “Automation will [strong verb] global employment prospects in the long term by [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].”
- Template B (nuanced): “Although automation will displace some jobs initially, it will [strong verb] employment overall by [reason 1] and [reason 2].”

Reason phrases you could insert (choose 2–3)
- “creating jobs in emerging sectors such as AI maintenance and green technology”
- “raising productivity and economic growth that generate new demand for labour”
- “shifting labour from routine tasks to safer, higher-skilled roles”
- “driving investment in reskilling and upskilling programmes”

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis now using one of those templates? Paste your revised sentence here and tell me when you’re satisfied with it — we’ll only move to Step 2 after you confirm the thesis is ready.
