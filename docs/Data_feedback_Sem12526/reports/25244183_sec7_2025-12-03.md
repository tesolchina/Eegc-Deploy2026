  - Revise topic sentences for clarity and grammatical accuracy.  
  - Add specific, concrete evidence (facts, dates, studies) to support claims about political pressure and consumer behavior.  
  - Correct grammatical mistakes and replace informal or vague phrases.

---

### Human-AI Interaction Assessment  

**Chat Exchanges:** 7 messages involving prompts, feedback, and student replies.  

- **In-Depth Conversation:** Moderate (3/5) — AI provided clear steps and templates; student responded with text excerpts but did not proceed to revision submission.  
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions:** Low (2/5) — Student did not affirmatively accept, question, or comment on AI suggestions; interaction remained mostly passive.  
- **Refining Process:** Very Low (1/5) — No revised thesis, topic sentence, or rewritten paragraph was submitted; no iterative revision cycle completed.

**Human-AI Interaction Total:** 6/15 — Indicates limited follow-through on revision guidance.

---

### Overall Performance Summary  

**Strengths:**  
- Clear understanding of essay topic and arguments; able to isolate thesis and key paragraphs.  
- Openness to AI guidance with some engagement in conversation.  
- AI assistant provided detailed, actionable advice using templates and checklists.

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- Complete revision tasks actively by submitting improved thesis and paragraph drafts.  
- Consistently apply grammar and clarity corrections.  
- Incorporate stronger, more concrete evidence into essay arguments.  
- Engage critically with AI suggestions by accepting, modifying, or rejecting them with reasons.  
- Develop independent editing skills beyond initial drafting.

---

### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment  

- **Context Provision:** Good — student supplied full essay text and excerpts when requested.  
- **Strategic Planning:** Needs Improvement — student did not follow through on planned revisions after receiving AI guidance.  
- **Critical Evaluation:** Needs Improvement — no explicit evaluation or feedback on AI advice was given.  
- **Independent Editing:** Needs Improvement — unchanged essay after guidance indicates limited autonomous revision.

---

### Recommendations for Future Development  

1. **Active Revision:** Submit a revised thesis statement that uses parallel structure and a confident tone. Then revise a topic sentence and a full body paragraph accordingly, sharing each for iterative feedback.  
2. **Grammar Focus:** Run sentence-level edits or request line-by-line grammar correction support from the AI to systematically address recurring errors.  
3. **Collaborative Engagement:** Explicitly respond to AI suggestions by accepting, revising, or rejecting them with brief explanation to demonstrate critical thinking and improve revision quality.  
4. **Use Evidence:** Add specific examples (dates of protests, names of policies, statistics on consumer behavior) to substantiate points and deepen development.

---

### Instructor Notes  

- The student has engaged but failed to complete substantive revision tasks despite clear guidance.  
- Recommend requiring the student to revise and resubmit with demonstrated revisions to the thesis, topic sentence, and body paragraph.  
- Encourage explicit communication about acceptance or critique of AI suggestions to foster deeper collaboration skills and editing independence.

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The essay presents a clear position (partial agreement) and two relevant lines of reasoning (influence on government; individual lifestyle choices). It uses examples (protests, consumer demand) to support points: e.g., "if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy." Development is adequate but could use deeper evidence and nuance.
- Organization: 21/25 - The structure is conventional and logical (intro, two body paragraphs, conclusion). Topic progression is clear (political influence then personal action). Transitions and paragraph cohesion are basic but serviceable.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - Language is generally clear but simple and sometimes imprecise ("normal people," "this is problem"). Topic-specific terms are present (carbon emissions, clean energy) but variety and precision could be improved.
- Grammar: 16/25 - Multiple grammatical and phrasing errors that sometimes disrupt flow (e.g., "But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action," "so it not really enough"). Sentence-level accuracy is inconsistent.
- **Original Essay Total: 76/100**

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 21/25 - The revised essay is identical in content to the original. No new development or evidence was added.
- Organization: 21/25 - Paragraphing and logical order remain the same; no structural improvements were made.
- Vocabulary: 18/25 - No lexical improvements; the same simple and sometimes imprecise wording remains.
- Grammar: 16/25 - Grammatical errors persist because the text was not changed.
- **Revised Essay Total: 76/100**

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +0 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - None — the revised essay is the same as the original, so no measurable improvements were implemented.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Strengthen and tighten the thesis to preview the two main points in parallel and use a more confident tone (e.g., remove hedging phrases like "I believe" and "I also think").
  - Revise topic sentences and body paragraph wording for clarity and grammatical correctness (e.g., fix "maybe just listen a little" → "may listen but take limited action").
  - Add concrete evidence or specific examples (dates, policies, studies) to support claims about government or consumer impact.
  - Improve sentence-level grammar and word choice (fix subject-verb agreement, remove informal phrasing).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 7**
- **Conversation Quality:** The assistant provided structured, task-focused guidance (e.g., templates and a checklist for thesis revision). The student supplied the original thesis and pasted paragraphs when prompted. However, the student did not submit a revised thesis, topic sentence, or revised body paragraph; interaction remained at the planning and drafting guidance stage without follow-through.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 3/5 - Evidence: Several meaningful back-and-forth messages (assistant: "Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?"; student pasted: "I partly agree..."), and the assistant gave detailed revision advice and a template. Total exchanges (7) indicate moderate engagement but fall short of an extensive iterative process (assistant gave multiple prompts but the conversation did not expand into many cycles).
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - Evidence: The assistant suggested specific changes (e.g., "avoid ‘I believe,’ use parallel preview of two points"), but the student did not explicitly evaluate or critique these suggestions in the chat. The student provided text excerpts but did not accept, reject, or comment on assistant recommendations with reasons.
- **Refining Process**: 1/5 - Evidence: No revised thesis sentence, no revised topic sentence, and no rewritten body paragraph were submitted after the assistant's guidance. The chat shows planning and prompts but no meaningful revision cycles. The student pasted existing sentences twice; the revised essay file is identical to the original.

- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 6/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- Clear identification of the essay's central issue and two coherent lines of argument (political influence; personal lifestyle changes). Example evidence: the user pasted the thesis and the two body-paragraph topics such as "The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government..." and "On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives..."
- Willingness to engage with the AI: the student responded to prompts and provided the thesis and paragraphs when asked.
- The AI assistant provided targeted, actionable guidance (templates, checklists, and concrete advice about tone and parallel structure).

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Execute revisions: follow through on the assistant's prompts by submitting a revised thesis, topic sentence, and a revised body paragraph.
- Grammar and clarity: correct recurring grammatical errors and informal phrasing (e.g., "so it not really enough" → "therefore it is insufficient").
- Depth of evidence: include more specific examples, facts, or citations to strengthen claims about policy impact and market responses.
- Active critical engagement: evaluate AI suggestions explicitly (accept/reject with reasoning) to demonstrate critical thinking in the human-AI collaboration process.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the essay and pasted the thesis and paragraphs when requested, giving the AI the necessary context.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The student did not complete the planned revision steps (no revised thesis/topic sentence/body paragraph).
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - There is no evidence the student assessed AI suggestions; they neither justified nor contested recommendations.
- **Independent Editing**: Needs Improvement - The final revised essay is unchanged, indicating little independent editing after receiving AI guidance.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Revise and resubmit: produce a single, revised thesis sentence using the assistant's template and a more confident tone; then revise one topic sentence and one full body paragraph accordingly. Submit each revision in the chat so the AI can give iterative feedback.
2. Address grammar systematically: run sentence-level edits (subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, punctuation). Ask the AI for a line-by-line correction of one paragraph to learn patterns of error.
3. Improve collaboration practice: when the AI proposes edits, explicitly respond with acceptance, rejection, or modification and give brief reasons. This will demonstrate critical evaluation and improve revision quality.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student engaged with the AI and received clear, actionable guidance, but did not complete the core revision tasks. The revised essay file is identical to the original, and the chat contains no completed revision cycle showing an updated thesis, topic sentence, or revised body paragraph.
- Recommend requesting the student to rework the thesis (use parallel preview and stronger stance), revise one topic sentence, and rewrite one body paragraph. Encourage the student to respond to AI suggestions with explicit decisions (accept/reject/revise) and to resubmit the updated text for reassessment.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

*Time:* 2025-12-02T18:22:10.986Z

**You:** I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

*Time:* 2025-12-02T18:22:27.543Z

**Assistant:** Thanks — this is a good starting thesis. Before we move on, let’s improve its clarity, strength, and focus.

Quick feedback on your current thesis:
- Clarity: It answers the question (you partly agree) but is a little wordy and repetitive.
- Strength: It hedges with phrases like “I believe” and “I also think,” which weaken your voice. Use firmer language.
- Focus: It names two ideas (influencing government; personal lifestyle choices) but doesn’t preview how you will develop them in the essay (e.g., political pressure and consumer behaviour).

What to change (keep this checklist in mind):
- State your position more confidently (avoid “I believe,” “I also think”).
- Be precise about the extent of agreement (e.g., “partly agree” is okay but clarify which side is stronger).
- Preview the two main points you will discuss (how individuals influence policy; how personal choices affect markets/behaviour).
- Keep it concise and clear.

Useful sentence template (fill the blanks — do not copy as a full model answer from me):
- “[Extent of agreement], because [main reason 1] and [main reason 2], although [limitation].”

Would you like to try revising your thesis now using that template? Paste your new version here, and we’ll refine it until you’re satisfied.

**You:** The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act.

*Time:* 2025-12-02T18:30:04.063Z

**Assistant:** Great progress — thanks for sharing your drafts and that topic-sentence line. Let’s start with Step 1 (thesis revision).

Quick feedback on your current thesis (final draft):
- Strengths: It answers the question and previews two clear reasons (political/collective action; consumer/lifestyle influence). The concession that lifestyle shifts alone are insufficient is good.
- What to improve: It’s a bit long and wordy. Phrases like “I mostly agree” and the parenthetical example weaken the confident academic voice. Make the position more concise and preview the two points in parallel, using precise terms (e.g., “policy pressure” or “collective political action” and “market/behavioural influence”).

Checklist to follow when you rewrite:
- State your position confidently and concisely (e.g., “I largely/mostly agree” or simply “I agree to a large extent”).
- Preview the two main points in parallel language (policy influence; market/behavioural influence).
- Keep the concession short (why individuals alone are insufficient).

Use this short template to try a revision (do not copy my exact words as a full sentence — fill in the blanks):
- “[Extent of agreement], because [how individuals influence policy] and [how personal choices affect markets/behaviour], although [limitation].”

Would you like to try revising your thesis now? Paste your new version here and I’ll give focused feedback.

Also: you pasted this sentence — “The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act.” — Is this the body paragraph you want to work on for Step 2? If so, confirm that you choose paragraph 1 and we’ll move to revising its topic sentence after you’re happy with the thesis.

*Time:* 2025-12-02T18:30:20.810Z

**You:** On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

*Time:* 2025-12-02T18:33:40.898Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s begin Step 1.

Please paste the single thesis sentence you want to work on (your current final-draft thesis is fine if you prefer). I’ll give brief, clear feedback on clarity, strength, and focus, and then I’ll ask you to try a revision.

Quick checklist I’ll use when I review your revision:
- Confident, concise wording (avoid “I believe,” “I also think,” “maybe”).
- Clear extent of agreement (e.g., “I largely/mostly agree” or “I agree to a large extent”).
- Parallel preview of the two main points (policy influence; market/behavioural influence).
- Short concession about why individual actions alone are insufficient.

Helpful template to fill in (do not copy this as a full sentence from me; use it to guide your wording):
- “[Extent of agreement], because [how individuals influence policy] and [how personal choices affect markets/behaviour], although [limitation].”

Would you like to try revising your thesis now? Paste your new version here, and we’ll refine it until you’re satisfied.

Also — before we move to Step 2: which body paragraph do you want to revise? Your options:
- Paragraph 1: the paragraph about influencing government/politicians.
- Paragraph 2: the paragraph about personal lifestyle choices and market demand.

If you choose paragraph 1, please confirm that now (and paste its current topic sentence if it’s different from what you posted earlier). Once you’re happy with the revised thesis and you confirm the paragraph choice, we’ll move to the topic-sentence revision.

*Time:* 2025-12-02T18:33:53.995Z
