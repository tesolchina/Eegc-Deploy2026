            ## Contribution Analysis

            Here is a summary of your training session status and recommendations:

**Training Progress:**  
- You have shared the original essay and identified the thesis statement as requested.  
- However, the revisions of the thesis statement, a topic sentence, and a body paragraph have not yet been submitted or discussed.

**Next Steps:**  
To complete the session, please revise:  
1. Your thesis statement to be clearer, stronger, and preview the two main essay points.  
2. One topic sentence from your body paragraphs.  
3. One body paragraph itself, improving clarity and style.

**Recommendations:**  
- Use the feedback already provided to rewrite your thesis statement.  
- Then, I can help review it and guide you to revise further parts.  
- Engage actively with each step, asking questions or discussing the AI’s suggestions to deepen your learning and collaboration skills.  
- Remember, this iterative process will improve your essay and your ability to work with AI assistance effectively.

Once you submit your revisions, I will provide detailed feedback and support your progress to completion. Please proceed when ready!

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. When many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to act. For example, if people protest or vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have joined together and forced their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This shows that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government maybe just listen a little and not really make strong action, so is not always working well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive. These actions are not as powerful as government policies, but they still matter. If many people try to live in a greener way, it can create a good example for others and send a message to companies that customers want eco-friendly products. For instance, if lots of people buy from green companies, businesses will try to be more sustainable to make more profit. But also, sometimes people don’t care and just want to do what is easy, so this is problem. Or maybe only a few people do green things but most people don’t change, so it not really enough to help the climate problem.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

Revised:
Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. From my perspective, it is not correct in total. I believe citizens are able to influence the government, which is very important. However, at the same time, personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

The most important way individuals can help fight climate change is by influencing the government and politicians. As many citizens demand better environmental laws, governments are more likely to take actions. For example, if people vote for leaders who care about the environment, it can push the government to ban pollution or invest in clean energy. In some countries, people have done so to force their leaders to make new rules about plastic or cutting carbon emissions. This demonstrates that public opinion and pressure from normal people can have a big effect, even if individuals alone do not have much power. But sometimes, the government may just listen a little and not really make strong action, so it not always works well. Also, sometimes people want change but they don’t know how to tell the politicians, so nothing happen.

On the other hand, individuals can also make small changes in their own lives, like recycling, using less water, or choosing to walk instead of drive.

In conclusion, while individual actions alone may not solve climate change, they are not completely useless. The most important thing is that citizens can influence governments to make strong decisions for the environment. At the same time, personal green habits can also help, even if they are less effective. In my opinion, everyone—governments, companies, and individuals—needs to work together to fight this problem.

**Assistant:** Welcome to the training mode of AI assistant. In this session, you are expected to revise the thesis statement to ensure it includes two main points that address the essay question.  
Can you first locate the thesis statement in the draft?

**Assistant:** Great! Let's start with Step 1: **Revising Your Thesis Statement.**

**Current Thesis Statement:**  
> Climate change is a very serious problem in the world today, and many people argue that the actions of individuals do not matter much compared to what governments and big companies can do. I partly agree with this idea because I believe citizens can still influence the government, which is very important, but at the same time, I also think that personal green lifestyle choices, while less impactful, still have a role to play.

**Feedback:**  
- **Clarity:** Your thesis states your position (partly agree) and explains why, but it is quite long and slightly confusing with multiple points in one sentence.
- **Strength:** It uses phrases like "I partly agree" and "I also think," which are less academic and not very confident.
- **Focus:** It could show more clearly what your essay will discuss (government influence and personal actions).

**Suggestions for Improvement:**  
- Make your opinion strong and clear.  
- Preview both main points: government influence and personal responsibility.  
- Use academic language and avoid first person (e.g., “I think”).

Would you like to try rewriting your thesis statement now, using these suggestions? Aim for one strong sentence that clearly previews your essay’s structure. I’m happy to give you feedback on your new version!
