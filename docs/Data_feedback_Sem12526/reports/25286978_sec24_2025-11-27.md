            ## Contribution Analysis

            Thank you for sharing the detailed assessment and chat history. It’s clear that you’ve made strong progress by revising the thesis and one body paragraph as guided. To help you continue advancing your essay, I can assist with any of the following next steps:

1. **Stronger thesis sentence that previews your main arguments more explicitly**  
   For example:  
   _“While AI disrupts many manual jobs, it simultaneously creates new skilled roles and calls for worker reskilling; thus, adapting education and policies is essential to harness AI’s benefits in the evolving job market.”_

2. **Tightened, clear conclusion that repairs the fragment and provides a strong final synthesis**  
   For example:  
   _“In conclusion, despite the disruptions AI causes in traditional employment, it also opens opportunities for new professions and increased productivity. Workers who adapt by developing relevant skills will be best positioned to thrive in this rapidly changing landscape.”_

3. **A short addition of concrete evidence or example to support your claims in the existing body paragraphs**  
   For example:  
   _“For instance, automation has significantly reduced manufacturing assembly line roles, but it has simultaneously created demand for AI trainers and algorithm engineers who program and maintain these systems.”_

Please let me know which of these you would find most helpful next, or if you'd prefer help with something else, such as refining vocabulary or organization further.  
I’m here to support your next revision steps!

# STUDENT ASSESSMENT REPORT
## Course: LANG 0036 - Enhancing English through Global Citizenship
## Module: AI for Revising Essays

### ESSAY WRITING ASSESSMENT

#### Original Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 16/25 - The draft identifies a clear topic (AI’s impact on employment) and gestures at a balanced view, but ideas are underdeveloped and vague (e.g., “not all negat-ve, which indicates the positive aspects also exit”).
- Organization: 16/25 - Basic paragraphing (intro + two body paragraphs) is present, but logical flow and clear topic sentences are weak.
- Vocabulary: 14/25 - Frequent word-choice errors and awkward collocations (e.g., “labours,” “infuesubstituted,” “robotic produces”) limit clarity.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 12/25 - Numerous grammar, spelling, and sentence-structure errors impede readability.
- **Original Essay Total: 58/100**

Evidence (original): “The technological shift is exactly undermining some labours' employment... most of the labours' jobs are just strength exercise, for which can be easily infuesubstituted by advanced robots.”

#### Revised Essay Scores:
- Content and Ideas: 20/25 - The revised essay presents a clearer balanced claim and expands on both negative and positive impacts (job displacement vs. new skilled roles). It still lacks concrete examples, data, or tighter argument preview.
- Organization: 20/25 - Paragraphs are clearer and more focused (e.g., an explicit “On one hand...”/“On the other hand...” structure). The conclusion, however, ends with a dangling phrase and could summarize and synthesize more effectively.
- Vocabulary: 21/25 - Improved precision and use of topic-specific terms (“assembly line,” “AI trainers,” “algorithm engineers”), though some phrasing could be tightened.
- Grammar and Sentence Structure: 20/25 - Major errors from the original are corrected and sentences are generally grammatical and varied. A final-sentence fragment (“...seize the opportunities brought .”) and occasional awkward phrasing remain.
- **Revised Essay Total: 81/100**

Evidence (revised): Thesis/intro: “With the rapid advancement of AI, the global job market is facing unprecedented challenges. However, it is widely recognized that the influence of AI on employment prospects is not entirely negative—there are also significant positive implications that deserve attention.” Body paragraph topic sentence: “On one hand, the technological shift driven by AI is indeed disrupting certain types of employment.”

#### Essay Improvement Analysis:
- **Overall Improvement: +23 points**
- **Key Improvements Made:**
  - Thesis and introduction rewritten to state a clearer balanced position and improved register.
  - Topic sentence and the body paragraph about job displacement substantially revised and expanded with clearer examples of job types (e.g., “assembly line work and basic data entry”).
  - Vocabulary and sentence-level grammar substantially improved; many original errors corrected.
- **Missed Opportunities:**
  - Thesis could more explicitly preview the main points to guide the essay’s structure (e.g., mention job losses, new skilled roles, and reskilling).
  - Support remains general—add concrete examples, statistics, or short case references to strengthen claims.
  - Conclusion needs repair (remove the fragment and provide a concise synthesis and final takeaway).

### HUMAN-AI INTERACTION ASSESSMENT

#### Chat History Analysis:
- **Total Exchanges: 3** (Assistant initial plan → Student: “Make it more advanced” → Assistant diagnostic & suggested steps)
- **Conversation Quality:** Sparse but focused. The assistant provided a detailed revision plan and diagnostic; the student responded with a brief directive and did not engage in further clarifying or evaluative dialogue.

#### Interaction Scores:
- **In-Depth Conversation**: 2/5 - The chat is brief (3 turns). The assistant offers depth, but the student’s interaction is minimal—one short instruction—and there is no extended back-and-forth.
  - Evidence: Student replied only, “Make it more advanced.”
- **Critical Review of AI Suggestions**: 2/5 - The student appears to accept the assistant’s guidance with little visible critique or selective justification in the chat history. There is no record of the student questioning or rejecting specific suggestions.
  - Evidence: Assistant proposed Step 1–3; the student did not request alternatives or justify choices in the chat.
- **Refining Process**: 2/5 - The revised essay shows the assistant’s suggested steps were followed (thesis + paragraph revision), but the chat shows only one round of instruction → one assistant response. Limited iterative cycles in the recorded chat.
  - Evidence: Assistant recommended focusing on thesis + paragraph; the revised essay reflects those changes but the chat lacks multiple revision iterations.
- **Human-AI Interaction Total: 6/15**

### OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

#### Strengths Demonstrated:
- The student followed the AI’s suggested revision plan: the thesis and a body paragraph were substantially rewritten (evidence: clear new intro and expanded second paragraph).
- Improved register and vocabulary: the revised essay uses more precise, topic-appropriate terminology (e.g., “AI trainers,” “assembly line”).
- Sentence-level errors were largely corrected, improving readability and coherence.

#### Areas for Improvement:
- Argument development: add concrete evidence (data, brief examples, or a referenced case) to strengthen claims.
- Thesis refinement: make the thesis more assertive and preview the essay’s main points to guide readers.
- Chat engagement and criticality: ask clarifying questions, challenge suggestions when appropriate, and iterate through multiple revision cycles to deepen the revision process.

#### AI Collaboration Skills Assessment:
- **Context Provision**: Good - The student provided the essay drafts and the one-line direction “Make it more advanced,” allowing the assistant to act; however, more context (audience, target grade, priorities) would help.
- **Strategic Planning**: Needs Improvement - The student accepted the assistant’s plan but did not document or discuss a strategic revision plan in chat beyond the single command.
- **Critical Evaluation**: Needs Improvement - There is little evidence the student critically evaluated or selectively adopted AI suggestions in the chat record.
- **Independent Editing**: Good - The student did perform substantive edits in the revised essay (thesis and paragraph) following guidance, demonstrating ability to apply suggestions.

### RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
1. Strengthen the thesis to explicitly preview the essay’s main claims (e.g., “While AI displaces manual jobs, it also creates high-skilled roles and demands reskilling, so policy and education must adapt.”).
2. Add at least one concrete example or statistic (even a brief, general example like “automation reduced certain manufacturing jobs” or “new roles such as data annotators/AI trainers have emerged”) to support claims.
3. Engage more interactively with the AI: ask targeted follow-up questions, request alternative phrasings, and run at least one additional revision cycle focused on conclusion and evidence.

### INSTRUCTOR NOTES
- The student clearly acted on the AI’s suggested steps (thesis + paragraph revision). The final draft shows substantial language improvement but still needs stronger argumentative development and a corrected conclusion fragment.
- Encourage the student to document their decision-making in chat (why they accepted/rejected suggestions) to better demonstrate critical engagement for the Human-AI Interaction rubric.

If you would like, I can:
- Propose a one-sentence stronger thesis that previews the essay’s points,
- Suggest a tightened conclusion to fix the dangling fragment, or
- Draft one short paragraph that adds a concrete example/statistic to support the claims.

        ## Complete Conversation
        **Assistant:** Original:
With the development of AI, our employment industries may face a great challenge. However, it’s firmly believed that the impact on global employment prospects is not all negat-ve, which indicates the positive aspects also exit.

The technological shift is exactly undermining some labours' employment. Initially, most of the labours' jobs are just strength exercise, for which can be easily infuesubstituted by advanced robots. Otherwise, a big bosses may have a tendency in capitalizing robots rather than labour. It is because the costs will be decrease due to the robotic produces are more economical than the wage they should pay for labours.

But when it comes to compliated teconolgy, things will be chang some. Workplaces on this aspect need wiser people to control the wage of AI.

Revised:
With the rapid advancement of AI, the global job market is facing unprecedented challenges. However, it is widely recognized that the influence of AI on employment prospects is not entirely negative—there are also significant positive implications that deserve attention.

On one hand, the technological shift driven by AI is indeed disrupting certain types of employment. Many manual and repetitive jobs, such as assembly line work and basic data entry, can be easily replaced by advanced robots and AI systems. For employers, investing in robotic technology often becomes a more cost-effective choice: robotic production reduces long-term expenses, as the cost of maintaining and operating AI systems is lower than the continuous wages and benefits required for human workers. This trend has led to job losses in some traditional industries, creating short-term pressure on the labor market.

On the other hand, AI also generates new opportunities and demands for skilled labor. When it comes to complex technological applications, human expertise remains irreplaceable. Workplaces now need professionals with specialized knowledge to manage, optimize, and innovate AI systems—roles like AI trainers, data analysts, and algorithm engineers have emerged and grown rapidly. Additionally, AI improves overall productivity, which can stimulate the growth of new industries and create more high-value jobs that focus on creativity, critical thinking, and human interaction, such as AI ethics consultants and personalized service providers.

In conclusion, while AI brings disruptions to the job market, it also reshapes employment structures and creates new prospects. By adapting to technological changes and upgrading their skills, workers can better navigate the evolving job landscape and seize the opportunities brought .

**Assistant:** Hi there! 👋 I’m your English writing coach, here to help you strengthen your essay through clear, focused revision. Before we dive in, we’ll take a moment to set some goals together.

Here’s how our session will work:

Negotiate your targets — We’ll start by discussing what you want to improve most in your essay.
Get a quick diagnosis — I’ll give you feedback on your essay based on key writing rubrics (like thesis, organization, evidence, and language).
Choose what to focus on — You’ll decide which issues you’d like to work on first.
Then we’ll move through a structured, three-step revision process:

Step 1: Revise your thesis statement.
Step 2: Choose one body paragraph and refine its topic sentence.
Step 3: Revise the rest of that paragraph for clarity and coherence.
My role is to guide you with questions, feedback, and examples—but you’ll always lead the revisions yourself. 💪

**You:** Make it more advanced

*Time:* 2025-11-27T15:33:36.086Z

**Assistant:** Great — let’s start the revision the way we agreed: by negotiating clear targets and diagnosing the draft so you can choose what to focus on.

1) Quick questions about your goals
- What are your main goals for this revision? (Choose any: clarity, argument strength, structure/organization, evidence/development, grammar/mechanics, academic style/word choice)
- Do you want the essay to sound more formal and academic, or more conversational?

2) My diagnostic reading (brief, tied to common rubric categories)

Thesis & Argument
- Strengths: You identify a clear topic (AI’s impact on employment) and signal a balanced view.
- Needs work: The thesis is vague and hedged (“may,” “it’s firmly believed,” “not all negative”). It doesn’t clearly answer a question or preview the main points you will discuss.

Organization
- Strengths: There is a clear paragraph structure (intro + two body paragraphs).
- Needs work: Topic sentences are unclear and don’t connect tightly to a stronger thesis. Transitions and logical flow need tightening.

Evidence & Development
- Strengths: You attempt to explain reasons (cost, automation) and raise a counterpoint (complex technology needs humans).
- Needs work: Claims are general and lack specific explanation or examples. The third paragraph is underdeveloped and needs clearer explanation of how new roles will emerge.

Language Use (grammar, vocabulary, sentence clarity)
- Strengths: Your meaning is often recoverable — the main ideas come through.
- Needs work: Many grammar, spelling, and word-choice errors (e.g., labours → workers, infuesubstituted → inferrable error, capitalizing robots → adopting/using robots, robotic produces → robots/robotic production). Register is informal in places (“big bosses”). Sentences are often awkward or ungrammatical, which reduces clarity.

3) My recommendation (pick 1–2 priorities to focus on in this session)
- I suggest we focus on:
  a) Strengthening the thesis so it states a clear position and previews the essay’s main points, and
  b) Improving language and clarity in one body paragraph (the paragraph about jobs being undermined by robots).
These two changes will make the essay read more advanced and give us a clearer foundation for further revisions.

Please tell me:
- Which of the suggested priorities would you like to focus on? (You can pick both or choose one.)
- Which sentence(s) in your draft do you want to be the thesis? (Is it the first two sentences in the intro? Or do you want to craft a single-line thesis?)

Once you confirm your targets and point out the thesis sentence you want to revise, we’ll move to Step 1 (thesis revision). Would you like to focus on the thesis + paragraph about job losses?
